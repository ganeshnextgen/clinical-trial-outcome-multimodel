NCT02280694,Low Dose Metronomic Poly-chemotherapy for Metastatic CRC,Metronomic Poly-chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer at Progression Following Established Treatments: Clinical and Laboratory Research,"This study investigates the activity of a new regimen of treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This includes a combination of well-known chemotherapy agents and anti-inflammatory agents, when administered orally at low daily doses and without planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen), in contrast with the conventional and already exhausted regimens of treatment at Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD) which required pre-planned brakes between treatment days.","Patients suffering from metastases of colorectal cancer whose tumor cells develop resistance to conventionally administered treatments are in need for new methods of treatment.

While their chemotherapy had been administered up till then at the classical regimen of Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD), which is aimed to directly killing maximal fractions of tumor cells, the present study evaluates the clinical benefit of a treatment which is based on old chemotherapeutic and old anti-inflammatory drugs, when these are administered at low doses,on daily basis and orally taken, without planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen).

Treatments based on this type of regimen have already been studied on other models of cancer and showed the capacity of suppressing tumor growth by a new category of anti-tumor effects. Namely, by affecting factors and mechanisms which prevail in the microenvironment that surrounds tumor deposits, thus circumventing the resistance of their cancer cells to chemotherapy.",COMPLETED,,2015-01,2019-12,2019-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,45,ACTUAL

NCT04329494,"PIPAC for the Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in Patients With Ovarian, Uterine, Appendiceal, Colorectal, or Gastric Cancer","Safety and Efficacy of Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosolized Chemotherapy (PIPAC) in Ovarian, Uterine, Appendiceal, Colorectal, and Gastric Cancer Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC)","This phase I trial studies the side effects of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in treating patients with ovarian, uterine, appendiceal, stomach (gastric), or colorectal cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneal carcinomatosis). Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, mitomycin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PIPAC is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The study device consists of a nebulizer (a device that turns liquids into a fine mist), which is connected to a high-pressure injector, and inserted into the abdomen (part of the body that contains the digestive organs) during a laparoscopic procedure (a surgery using small incisions to introduce air and to insert a camera and other instruments in the abdominal cavity for diagnosis and/or to perform routine surgical procedures). Pressurization of the liquid chemotherapy through the study device results in aerosolization (a fine mist or spray) of the chemotherapy intra-abdominally (into the abdomen). Giving chemotherapy through PIPAC may reduce the amount of chemotherapy needed to achieve acceptable drug concentration, and therefore potentially reduces side effects and toxicities.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in 3 groups of patients: peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) due to primary ovarian, uterine, or gastric carcinoma (Arm 1); PC due to primary colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 2).

II. To evaluate safety of PIPAC and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PIPAC with MMC in patients with PC due to colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 3).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Ability to proceed to cytoreduction with/without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) (Arm 3 patients).

II. Efficacy will be assessed by:

Ia. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), if available, version 1.1 via computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline (week 10, and 6 weeks after completing treatment; and at 18 weeks).

Ib. Peritoneal regression grading score (PRGS) via biopsy at each cycle (both pre-PIPAC and post-PIPAC peritoneal samples will be obtained).

Ic. Peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) at the time of laparoscopy. II. Post-operative surgical complications by Claven-Dindo classification evaluated at 4, 10, and 16 weeks (4 weeks after each PIPAC).

III. Progression-free survival. IV. PIPAC technical failure rate. V. Patient-reported health state/quality of life and symptoms before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 weeks as measured by the European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).

VI. Functional status, as measured by the number of daily steps before and after treatments (Vivofit 4 wristband pedometer - Garmin Company).

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses imaging to provide a three-dimensional view of the area to be irradiated. Doctors can then shape and direct the radiation beams at the area from multiple directions while avoiding, as much as possible, nearby organs. TMLI is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow. Radiation therapy is given before transplant to suppress the immune system, prevent rejection of the transplanted cells, and wipe out any remaining cancer cells. TMLI may allow a greater radiation dose to be delivered to the bone marrow as a preparative regimen before transplant while causing fewer side effects than standard radiation therapy.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

These treatment protocols are highly gonadotoxic (i.e. they may cause later fertility problems) and therefore these patients have been proposed to store some testicular tissue during childhood as an option to preserve their fertility.

The main questions this study aims to answer are (1) the impact of the received gonadotoxic treatment on the later fertility status and (2) the additional impact of a testicular biopsy procedure (performed at a young age to harvest testicular tissue for storage) on the future fertility.

Participants will be asked to undergo a physical examination by a fertility specialist, to undergo a scrotal ultrasound, to give a blood sample, and to provide a semen sample.

3. To explore the value of musculoskeletal cross-modal imaging assessment system of ultrasound combined with abdominal CT/MRI in evaluating the long-term prognosis of patients with lung cancer.","Sarcopenia is a progressive and systemic skeletal muscle disease that involves accelerated loss of muscle mass and function and is associated with increased adverse outcomes in older adults such as falls, functional decline, weakness, and death. It can be comorbid with a variety of diseases and interacts extensively with various disease states to influence disease prognosis. According to literature reports, the prevalence of sarcopenia in lung cancer patients is 42.8%-45.0%, and many studies have confirmed that sarcopenia is associated with a variety of poor prognosis of lung cancer. Early identification of sarcopenia in lung cancer patients and early intervention before the surgery are very important steps to improve the prognosis of lung patients.

However, at present, the evaluation methods of sarcopenia are very complicated, which rely on three features: loss of muscle mass, loss of muscle strength, and loss of physical performance. At present, physicians usually use bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to determine skeletal muscle mass index SMI to measure muscle mass, grip strength test to measure muscle strength, gait speed or tools such as SPPB scores to assess physical performance. A diagnosis of sarcopenia can be made when a subject experiences a decrease in SMI combined with a decrease in grip strength or a decrease in gait speed. The above evaluation methods are difficult to be used as routine preoperative evaluation items.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SMI in older adults can be accurately estimated by using muscle thickness acquired from ultrasound examination with basic information such as age and body mass index (BMI). And it has been shown that the cross-sectional area of the psoas major muscle at L3-level assessed by CT/MRI can also preliminarily diagnose sarcopenia. However, existing alternatives for assessing sarcopenia with ultrasound or CT/MRI alone are incomplete and lack stability.

Fronted with such a dilemma, we attempted to establish a musculoskeletal cross-modal imaging evaluation system of ultrasound combined with abdominal CT/MRI images, which can diagnose sarcopenia more comprehensively and accurately, and evaluate the perioperative prognosis, nutritional support effect and long-term prognosis of patients.",RECRUITING,,2023-11-01,2028-11,2027-11,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1500,ESTIMATED

Opioids are known to suppress immune function following both acute and chronic administration; however, they appear to be different according to the schedule of administration as well as the state of the organism. Programmed death-1 (PD-1, also known as CD279) belongs to the CD28 receptor superfamily. It is an inhibitory receptor, and its expression is upregulated on activated leukocytes, resulting in an inhibited immune response. PD-1 interacts with two ligands: programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also referred to as B7-H1) and programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2, also known as B7-DC). PD-L2 is expressed mainly on activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, whereas PD-L1 is distributed widely. In addition to immune cells, some subsets of tumor cells also express PD-L1 to escape from immunosurveillance.

The aim of PAMELA is to test the hypothesis that PAM50 HER2-enriched (HER2-E) subtype better predicts response to neoadjuvant dual anti-HER2 blockade, with or without endocrine therapy, compared to traditional clinical HER2 classification. Furthermore, we posit that characterization of gene expression patterns may identify profiles of those who may be safely spared chemotherapy.","PAMELA is a non-randomized, open label, multicentric translational research study of neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade therapy without chemotherapy. Although efficacy and safety will be investigated, the primary goal is to identify profiles predictive of clinical benefit from targeted therapy. Eligible patients must be women with untreated primary HER2-overexpressing and/or amplified breast tumors of more than 1 cm in diameter amenable to definitive surgery (stage I-IIIA).

The PAMELA study is designed to test the hypothesis that the PAM50 HER2-E subtype is able to predict clinical response to neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade with lapatinib and trastuzumab, with or without endocrine therapy, assessed by pathological complete response in the breast (pCRB) rate at the time of surgery, compared to traditional clinical HER2 classification. Furthermore, we posit that characterization of gene expression patterns may identify profiles of those who may be safely spared chemotherapy.

Patients will first undergo screening, tumor measurement, and mandatory collection of core tumor biopsies for central determination of HER2 and HR status. These biopsies will be used to determine gene expression patterns once the patient is included in the study. Patients will be treated with dual HER2 blockade consisting of lapatinib and trastuzumab for a total of 18 weeks. Patients who are HR-positive will also be given endocrine therapy, letrozole or tamoxifen depending on their menopausal status, for the same 18 weeks. If tumor progression is observed by ultrasound (US) at week 6, tumors will be identified as resistant, and paclitaxel will be added to dual HER2 blockade, maintaining trastuzumab at the same original dose and reducing lapatinib dose for safety reasons. In those patients with HR-positive disease, endocrine therapy will be withdrawn in order to avoid its adverse interactions with chemotherapy.

Two weeks after the first administration of study medication, all patients will undergo mandatory repeat tumor tissue acquisition that will be used for secondary endpoint assessment.

Post treatment tissue acquisition will be obtained at the time of surgery from the specimen excised.

US of the breast and axillary lymph nodes will be performed at baseline, Day 14, week 6, and prior to surgery, and will be correlated with pCR. If tumor progression is observed on week 6, the US will be repeated on week 10 to discard the progression continues despite the addition of paclitaxel at neoadjuvant regimen.

Mammography is required at baseline and prior to surgery, but will not be used for the objective response assessment.

Treatment will be given until definitive surgery, clinical signs of disease progression after paclitaxel addition, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.

Breast surgery will be carried out 1 to 3 weeks after completion of dual HER2 blockade with or without endocrine therapy, and 2 to 3 weeks after completion of paclitaxel plus dual HER2 blockade, should it had been initiated for progressive disease.

With current treatment, event-free survival (EFS) rates vary between 75%\~85%. Two different MTX intensification strategies are used commonly: HD-MTX with leucovorin rescue, and Capizzi-style MTX without leucovorin rescue plus PEG-ASP (C-MTX). Although superior outcome of patients with T-ALL receiving C-MTX compared with HD-MTX on the AALL0434 trial, the 2 approaches had not been compared directly in patients with T-LBL. There remains controversy on PET/CT interpretation in children with NHL. Large prospective studies in pediatric patients with T-LBL regarding PET/CT value for this is scarce. Around 1% pediatric patients with T-LBL will not achieve remission at the end of Induction (induction failure). The optimal treatment for this small subgroup is largely unclear. The BFM HR Blocks usually are applied to these patients even though the efficacy is unknown. Novel targeted therapies are needed for use. Dasatinib is identified as a targeted therapy for T-cell ALL in preclinical drug screening.","1. T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) which involves 90% of LBL cases is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children and adolescents. With current treatment, event-free survival (EFS) rates vary between 75%\~85%. Poor probabilities of survival (10\~15%) for patients after relapse leave no room for treatment de-escalation in frontline protocols. Limitations in numbers of newly diagnosed patients impeded evaluation potential prognostic markers and validation or conducting clinical studies.
2. In the GER-GPOH-NHL-BFM-95 study, the prophylactic cranial radiation was omitted, and the intensity of induction therapy was decreased slightly. There were no significant increases in CNS relapses, suggesting cranial radiation may be reserved for patients with CNS disease at diagnosis. The 5-year EFS was worse in NHL-BFM-95 (82%) than in NHL-BFM-90 (90%). It was proposed that the major difference in EFS between NHL-BFM-90 and NHL-BFM-95 resulted from the increased number of subsequent neoplasms observed in NHL-BFM-95.
3. Two different MTX intensification strategies are used commonly: HD-MTX with leucovorin rescue, and Capizzi-style MTX without leucovorin rescue plus PEG-ASP (C-MTX). Although superior outcome of patients with T-ALL receiving C-MTX compared with HD-MTX on the AALL0434 trial, the 2 approaches had not been compared directly in patients with T-LBL.
4. POG 9404: the small cohort (n = 66) of lymphoma patients who did not receive HD-MTX, the 5-year EFS was 88%. Of note, all of these patients received prophylactic cranial radiation therapy, which has been demonstrated not to be required in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) patients.
5. COG-A5971 evaluated 2 strategies for CNS prophylaxis without CNS irradiation \[5\]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive HD-MTX in interim maintenance (BFM-95) or intrathecal chemotherapy throughout maintenance (CCG-BFM). The overall incidence of CNS relapse was 1.2%, and there was no difference between the treatment arms for CNS relapse, DFS, or OS. Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) \>1% by FLOW at diagnosis was shown to be associated with a worse outcome in this trial (a BFM backbone containing HD-MTX). Measurement of bone marrow MDD at diagnosis with sequential response monitoring through peripheral blood during remission induction to aid treatment stratification was also suggested in an early COG study. The prognostic significance of MDD at End-of-Induction (EOI) or End-of-Consolidation (EOC) for T-LBL patients with positive MDD at diagnosis is still unclear.
6. COG AALL0434: the COG ABFM regimen with C-MTX provided excellent DFS without cranial radiation for patients with standard risk T-LBL (85%, Arm A, n=82, completed 64) and high risk T-LBL (85%, Arm A, n=61, completed 51) although patients with CNS 3 were not included. It appears that C-MTX may have negated the prognostic impact of MDD.
7. Nelarabine is unavailable in mainland China at this time, which did not show benefit in COG AALL0434 study.
8. AALL07P1: 10 patients with T-LBL in first relapse treated with a 4-drug induction regimen adding bortezomib: 7 had a response (1 had a complete response, 2 had unconfirmed complete responses, and 4 had partial responses)
9. COG AALL1231 for T-LBL: the 4-year EFS and OS were better in bortezomib group than the control group (86.4% and 89.5% vs. 76.5% and 78.3%, p=0.041 and 0.009, respectively.). Incorporating bortezomib into standard therapy for de novo T-LBL appears beneficial.
10. A biopsy for pathological examination of a mediastinal residual mass is a clinical dilemma. Currently, conventional imaging is still considered as the ""standard"" modality for evaluating pediatric patients with NHL at diagnosis and subsequent response. There remains controversy on PET/CT interpretation in children with NHL. Large prospective studies in pediatric patients with T-LBL regarding PET/CT value for this is scarce.
11. Although an overlap in morphology and immune-phenotyping exists in T-LBL and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), different disease distribution suggests possible different genetic profiles and pathogenesis. Except for stage, none of other parameters is used in the current stratification system outside of clinical trials for T-LBL (several candidates, but none have been validated sufficiently). Little is known about biomarkers with prognostic relevance for T-LBL. To improve risk stratification strategy and better understand biologic rationale for incorporating novel therapies (chemicals, target agents and immunotherapy) into a conventional chemotherapy backbone, translational research to identify molecular markers with prognostic relevance in T-LBL is highly recommended.
12. With the current treatment, around 1% pediatric patients with T-LBL will not achieve remission at the end of Induction (induction failure). The optimal treatment for this small subgroup is largely unclear. The BFM HR Blocks usually are applied to these patients even though the efficacy is unknown.

Incidence of treatment discontinuations due to AEs and SAEs will be summarised overall and by dose. -Safety Lab parameters and vital signs at pre-treatment and post-treatment and corresponding changes from pre-treatment will be presented by dose as descriptive statistics. Efficacy analysis will be performed on efficacy population. Dyspnoea will be scored from screening to D30. Dyspnoea score will be presented at pre- and post-treatment and change from pre- to post-treatment will be presented as descriptive statistics by dose. The pleural infusion index will be determined by comparing chest X-rays before treatment (D0) and post-treatment at D1, D10 and 30 days and pleurodesis or indwelling catheter placement. The index will be presented at pre- and post-treatment and change from pre- to post-treatment will be presented as descriptive statistics by dose. Exploratory endpoints: exploratory analyses will be performed by tissue immunostaining and image analysis will be carried out. The concentration of cisplatin in tumor tissue at the beginning and end of mild hyperthermia PITHAC will be evaluated by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) that will allow visualization of cisplatin distribution and penetration in tumor biopsies. The correlation between cisplatin concentration and penetration into tumor tissue and clinical response will be explored. Immune infiltration in tumor tissues will be assessed by immunostainings and image analysis will be performed. Immune cells proportions in peripheral blood before and after PITHAC at D0, 10 and 30 will be explored using DURAClone Panels for flow cytometry.

PART B: Expansion: Determination of Sample Size: the sample in the expansion phase is not based on a formal hypothesis.

The data collected through RedCap® will be automatically checked by the implementation of data validation rules (e.g., data-type, maximum/minimum range, missing data checks, and other logical tests) and automatic alerts. Specification of source documents: study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial. The Investigator must keep a subject file (medical file, original medical records) electronically (SOARIAN/ARCHIMEDE) for every subject included in the trial. All documents containing source data must be filed in the electronic patient file. Electronic subject files (SOARIAN/ARCHIMEDE) will be accessible to the Monitor to perform source data verification. Record keeping / archiving: the SI will retain copies of the patient trial records (CRFs, patient informed consent statement, drug inventory logs and all other information collected during the trial) and documentation until at least 10 years after the termination of the trial.It must be available for review by the Monitor and must be ready for Sponsor audit as well as for inspection by Competent Authorities during and after the trial and must be safely archived for at least 10 years (or per local requirements or as otherwise notified by the Sponsor) after the end of the trial. The documents to be thus archived include the Subject Identification List and the signed subject ICFs.

Safety Monitoring (Dose Escalation Part): a Trial Safety Board (TSB) will be constituted for the part A of the trial, being responsible for maintaining the scientific integrity of the trial and safety of patients. This Board will review the DLTs of each cohort and decide whether to escalate or not to the next dose level (next cohort). Details on the dose escalation design, rules, and the role of the TSB are provided in the DEP. The TSB will give the green light to start part B after recommended dose confirmation, based on safety and efficacy data of all patients enrolled in part A. For Part B, the responsibility for the safety of the individual patient lies with the investigator and the SI.

NCT05549960,Pre-planning Mathematical Models in EUS-guided Laser Ablation of Pancreatic Lesions,Use of Pre-planning Models for the Guidance of the Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Laser Ablation of Pancreatic Lesions,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth cause of cancer death in Western countries. More than 50% of the patients with PDAC has a local advanced or metastatic disease at the time of the diagnosis. There is a growing interest in the investigation of novel and alternative therapeutic strategies which could be used in synergy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. These methods include echoendoscopic (EUS) guided locoregional ablation to reduce the tumoral mass.

The most studied technique is the radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Another interesting technique involves the use of the laser source at a wavelength of 1064 nm. Among all the ablative methods, LA is the only one that allows the use of a thinner needle. These features make LA a suitable option for treating focal lesions in high-risk areas or in hard-to-reach locations. A previous study demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in pancreatic solid lesions.

In order to perform a study aimed at the complete treatment of the lesion, it is necessary to identify the laser parameters which are specific to the size and location of the lesion.

The present protocol presents a prospective interventional study aimed at the analysis and applicability of predictive mathematical models for the calculation of laser settings in the ablation of pancreatic lesion by means of a EUS-guided LA.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth cause of cancer death in Western countries, with an estimation of 57,600 new cases and 47,050 deaths in 2020 in USA.

Since the number of deaths due to this lethal disease is rapidly increasing, it is estimated to become the second leading cause of tumor-related death by 2030.

The high mortality rate of PDAC is due to several causes, including: i) a poor early diagnosis, ii) the severe biological aggressiveness, and iii) the lack of response to the systemic therapies.

At present, surgical resection, i.e., pancreatectomy, represents the only widely accepted treatment option with the potential to increase long-term survival. However, only 20% of the patients are appropriate surgical candidates at the time of the diagnosis. In the majority of the patients, the disease is at an advanced or metastatic stadium, and the surgical resection does not represent a possible option. In these last cases, only palliative solutions are available.

Nowadays there is a growing interest in the investigation of novel and alternative therapeutic strategies which could be used in synergy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. These methods include the inoculation o antitumoral agents within the lesion, through laparoscopic, percutaneous or echoendoscopic (EUS) guidance and locoregional ablation to reduce the tumoral mass.

This solution may be particularly beneficial for those patients who are stable after the chemotherapy, without any signs of disease regression neither progression. The ablation can be obtained with different kinds of energy sources, including radiofrequency, microwave and laser.

The first study of EUS-guided LA on human patients was conducted by Di Matteo and collaborators who recently performed a prospective study on the feasibility of EUS-guided LA in cases of inoperable and locally advanced PDAC. A total of 9 patients with stage III pancreatic cancer were screened and underwent EUS-guided LA. The fiber was placed in the upper part of the lesion and the following laser power parameters were applied: 2 W for 800 J, 1000 J, or 1200 J; 3 W for 800 J, 1000 J, or 1200 J; 4 W for 800 J, 1000 J, or 1200 J. The application time automatically ranges between 200 and 600 s, according to the power values. No difficulty was experienced in the technical execution of the procedure. The fiber was clearly visible within the targeted lesion, for the entire duration of the application of laser energy. During the procedure, the tip of the fiber was progressively surrounded by a hyperechoic area. This effect did not compromise the endosonographic visualization of the needle inside the lesion. At the end of the ablation, the EUS highlighted a hyperechoic area along the path of the probe, surrounded by non-homogeneous tissue with hyperechoic areas. No relevant complications were found. Control CT scans after 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days showed well-defined coagulative necrotic areas. The average ablation volumes obtained at 800 J decreased by 85% (1.18 cm3 after 24 hours against 0.17 cm3 after 30 days). The average ablation volumes obtained at 1000 J decreased by 76% (3.16 cm3 after 24 hours against 0.80 cm3 after 30 days). Finally, the mean ablation volumes at 1200 J decreased by 44% after 30 days from treatment (1.77 cm3 after 24 hours against 0.98 cm3 after 30 days). According to these results, the 4 W / 1000 J power configuration achieved the largest ablation volume, without clinical complications.

In order to perform a study aimed at the complete treatment of the lesion, it is necessary to identify the laser parameters which are specific to the size and location of the lesion. As identified in a recent study by Paiella, the choice of settings and handling of the laser device requires a certain learning curve. Therefore, a predictive mathematical model of the setting parameters can be very beneficial to simplify the ablative procedure. Furthermore, in the absence of correct parameters, several potential complications can occur, such as acute pancreatitis, bleeding from adjacent vascular structures, duodenal perforation or lesion of the biliary tract.

The effectiveness of predictive models for LA has already been demonstrated in some ex vivo and preclinical studies, both on the pancreas and on other tissues.

Considering all the aspects above, the present protocol presents a prospective interventional study aimed at the analysis and applicability of predictive mathematical models for the calculation of laser settings in the ablation of pancreatic lesion by means of a EUS-guided LA.

The investigators will use a mathematical model for the calculation of the laser parameters (power, treatment time), taking into account the size of the tumor and some anatomical characteristics, such as the proximity of blood vessels. The aims of this study fall within the objectives of the European project LASER OPTIMAL (Laser Ablation: Selectivity and Monitoring for Optimal Tumor Removal, GA 759159, http://www.laseroptimal.polimi.it/) of which Professor Saccomandi is Principal Investigator and Dr. Di Matteo is an expert for clinical procedures.

This is a prospective interventional study involving two Italian centers, the Operative Digestive Endoscopy UOC of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico (the ""Coordinating Center"") and the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Politecnico di Milano.

This is a non-controlled, non-randomized interventional feasibility study with a non-commercial purpose.

The Operative Digestive Endoscopy UOC of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico will be responsible for enrolling patients and performing the medical procedures. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of Politecnico di Milano will work on the laser parameters estimation using a mathematical model. Pre-operative radiological images of the candidates will be used for the purpose.

Patients with stage III and IV PDAC; non-functioning or functioning neuroendocrine tumors; pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma will be evaluated and included in the study if eligible.

All patients will be followed at the Coordinating Center from enrollment to death or the end of the study.

Description of study procedures:

1. Preoperative radiological image acquisition.

   MR images collected within 7 days before the LA EUS-guided procedure will be used by the study collaborators to reconstruct the patient's model. The tumor size and some anatomical features, such as the proximity of blood vessels, will be used in the patient's model. Techniques of image segmentation, 3D geometry reconstruction, and mathematical simulation of laser-tissue interaction will be used to estimate the optimal parameters for the laser (power, energy, time), according to the procedure described by Scott et al. Specifically, Mimics Innovation Suite software will be used to obtain the 3D geometry of the anatomical part of interest (pancreas, tumor, surrounding structures). This will then be imported into finite element computational software (Comsol Multiphysics) allowing the correct and patient-specific settings to be calculated.
2. Estimation of laser parameter settings with the mathematical model

   The mathematical model is based on finite element simulations implemented using the commercial Comsol Multiphysics software, as previously proposed by Scott et al. Laser settings will be based on values calculated in the Di Matteo and coworkers's experimentation, as previously performed by Saccomandi et al. on ex vivo models. This part of the study will be carried out in collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Politecnico di Milano as part of the European LASEROPTIMAL project (www.laseroptimal.polimi.it), coordinated by Paola Saccomandi, and for which Dr. Di Matteo is an external expert.
3. LA EUS-guided

EUS will be performed with a FUJIFILM EG- 580UT linear endoscope. Procedures will be performed on the patient under deep sedation, positioned on the left flank.

Prophylactic antibiotics will be administered immediately before the procedure and for the following 3 days (ceftriaxone 1 g twice daily intravenously). LA will be performed with a 980 nm laser light (EUFOTON Laser Spectrum) guided by a 300 μm optical fiber (EUFOTON). An 22 Gauge needle (Boston Scientific Expect Slimline) will be used for the optical fiber placement.

The protrusion of the fiber end from the needle tip should be 5 mm. After the correct placement of the fiber inside the tumor, the ablation treatment can start. Once inside the lesion, the needle will be slightly retracted, and the fiber will be gently pushed out of the needle tip by a length of 5 mm. The fiber will be placed at the top of the lesion, and the laser will be turned on. The laser settings estimated by the mathematical model will be used. The total number of ablations will depend on the radiological characteristics of the lesion and location. Special attention must be paid to have 1 cm between the fiber tip, the walls of the main vessels, and any metal stents that may be present.",UNKNOWN,,2023-02-01,2023-12-01,2023-11-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,10,ESTIMATED

Some cytostatics and their metabolites can also induce diarrhea directly due to effect on the intestinal mucosa.

Use of probiotics in prevention and treatment of diarrhea relies on both the theoretical assumptions and the results of several clinical trials. Lactic acid bacteria involved in the treatment of dysbiosis, compete for substrate with pathogenic bacteria, produce bacterio-cins, increase transepithelial resistance. Their enzymatic activity affects activation or deactivation of metabolites which cause diarrhea. Production of short chain fatty acids, which are important for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal cells also contributes to their antidiarrhoeal effect.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial was designed to evaluate potential of probiotics to prevent grade 3-4 diarrhea in patients treated by irinotecan based chemotherapy during first 6 weeks of irinotecan based chemotherapy","In preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea in double blind placebo controlled clinical trials it was found protective effect of probiotics containing S. boulardii and Enterococcus faecium. Also in preventing infectious diseases associated with Clostridium difficile, administration of probiotics resulted in a significant decrease in disease recurrence. Duration of rotavirus diarrhea, in children and in immunocompromised HIV-positive patients was significantly shortened after administration of strains of Lactobacilli and S. boulardii respectively.

Meta-analysis of 9 randomized, placebo-controlled trials showed significant reduction in the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhea in children. Another meta-analysis in which 23 studies were included showed significant reduction in risk of infectious diarrhea. Most of these studies was carried out with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG®.

The incidence of diarrhea during treatment of acute leukemia is between 15 to 80%. Severe diarrhea level 3 to 4 is present in 8-20% and is much more common during the induction phase of chemotherapy. In phase II study performed in NCI Slovakia preventive administration of Enterococcus faecium probiotic strain M-74 with selenium was associated with low incidence (14%) and severity (all grade 1) diarrhea, despite the fact that half of the patients received induction therapy. The investigators noted safety of probiotic strain during 370 days of severe neutropenia Gr 3-4.

The incidence of irinotecan induced diarrhea varies between 60-90%, by which the incidence of severe diarrhea is 20-40%. In phase II studies, its incidence was 17% in NCI Slovakia, but irinotecan dose was reduced by 25% in all patients. Diarrhea is an important factor in morbidity and mortality during irinotecan based chemotherapy. Predisposing factors are age over 65 years, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) PS (Performance status) of 1 and previous abdominopelvic radiation. One of irinotecan metabolites, SN-38 (7-ethyl-10 hydroxycamptothecin), which is glucuronidated in the liver and subsequently expelled into intestine is main cause of diarrhea. Due to the bacterial enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase it is deconjugated in intestinal lumen again. This form causes direct damage to intestinal mucosa associated with malabsorption of water, electrolytes and development of diarrhea.

Reduction of activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase using broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or beta-D-glucuronidase inhibitors is one of the ways to avoid irinotecan induced diarrhea. It is also possible to modulate metabolism of irinotecan using cyclosporine and phenobarbital to reduce biliary excretion of SN-38 and induction of glucuronidation. Promising results were shown using activated charcoal, which has resulted in the absorption of SN-38. Also other methods were tested: oral alkalization, thalidomide, amifostine, but without success. These procedures have been studied only in phase II trials. It is known that some probiotic bacteria, reduce activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase and therefore these bacteria could be applied in the prevention of diarrhea in patients treated by irinotecan based therapy.

Results of phase III study, that was prematurely terminated due to poor accrual showed benefit of Colon Dophilus on irinotecan induced gastrointestinal toxicity. In this trial, 46 patients with colorectal cancer starting a new line of irinotecan based therapy were enrolled. 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine along with irinotecan was administered to 26 (56.5%) patients and 22 (47.8%) patients received biological therapy as well. Patients were randomized 1:1 to probiotic (PRO) or placebo arm (PLA). Probiotic formula Colon Dophilus, was administered at a dose of 10x109 CFU (colony forming unit) of bacteria tid, orally for 12 weeks of chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea. 23 patients were randomized to PRO and 23 patients to PLA. Administration of probiotics compared to placebo led to a reduction in the incidence of severe diarrhea of grade 3 or 4 (0% for PRO vs. 17.4% for PLA, p = 0.11), as well as reduction of the overall incidence of diarrhea (39.1% for PRO vs. 60.9% for PLA, p = 0.24) and incidence of enterocolitis (0% for PRO vs. 8.7% for PLA). Patients on PRO used less loperamide compared to PLA (mean duration of loperamide use: 4.5 days for PRO vs. 10.4 days for PLA, p = 0.45; mean number of loperamide tablets: 5.9 for PRO vs. 37.7 for PLA, p = 0.49). There was no infection caused by probiotic strains recorded.

Two recent studies in murine model showed, that bacteria in the gut enhance the body's immune response to cancer, mobilizing immune cells to kill cancer cells, not just in the gut but throughout the body as well. The researchers also found that the bacteria affect the efficacy of three different cancer treatments.

Given their low toxicity, good tolerability, probiotics may be an important part of supportive therapy and moreover they can enhance efficacy of anticancer therapy. The objective of this phase III. trial is to determine effectiveness of the probiotic formula Probio-Tec® BG-VCap-6.5 in the prophylaxis of irinotecan induced diarrhea due to reduction intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase activity and further biochemical and physiological actions of specific strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12® and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG®, LGG® that are active substances of used food supplement - PROBIO-FIX INUM®. Both of strains are well-documented. LGG® has been studied in more over 800 scientific publications. Studies have found that LGG® supports immunity, enhances antibody formation during viral infection, and decreases incidence of gastrointestinal infections, antibiotic associated diarrhoea, and respiratory infections. In addition to its well-researched health benefits, the safety of LGG® has been more widely studied than any other probiotic bacterium. It has a safe history of use in foods and is extensively documented in more over 200 clinical studies.

The large number of clinical studies and scientific publications indicate that the BB-12® probiotic strain - alone or in combination with other of probiotic strains (e.g. LGG®) - may have beneficial effects regarding the gastrointestinal and immune areas. BB-12® is considered to be best studied probiotic bifidobacteria, described in more than 360 scientific studies.",COMPLETED,,2016-03,2022-11,2022-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,PREVENTION,233,ACTUAL

NCT03395860,Low Dose ATG Plus Low Dose PTCy as GVHD Prophylaxis in Haplo-HSCT,Low Dose Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin Plus Low-dose Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide as GVHD in Hapl-HSCT for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies: a Phase II Trial,Low dose Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin plus Low-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with hematologic malignancies,"A novel regimen, which is composed of a low dose of ATG (5 mg/kg) and low-dose PTCy (one dose of PTCy, 50mg/kg) for GVHD prophylaxis in haplo-HSCT for patients with hematologic malignancies, is going to be evaluated in the prospective, randomized control, phase II clinical trial. It is theoretically feasible because the mechanisms of ATG and Cyclophosphamide on T lymphocyte are different. ATG plays the immunosuppressive activity on the depletion of peripheral T lymphocytes through complement dependent lysis or activation-associated apoptosis. ATG also modulates cell-surface expression of surface adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors. In addition, ATG can also affect or interfere with the function of different immune cells such as B lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg), natural killer (NK)-T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC).Cyclophosphamide is nontoxic to hematopoietic stem cells and can selectively deplete the alloreactive T cells. Therefore, we hypothesis that ATG followed by PTCy have the synergistic effect on GVHD prophylaxis. (2) Luznik et al also showed that there was no difference in the incidence of severe acute GVHD between one or two doses of PTCy. Furthermore, there was a trend toward a lower incidence of extensive cGVHD among patients of two doses of PTCy compared with one dose PTCy. One dose of PTCy might preserve the GVL effect without influencing the incidence of the severe aGVHD. (3) Y Wang et al reported a randomized clinical trial comparing two different doses of ATG (6 and 10mg/kg) as GVHD prophylaxis for Haplo-HSCT. There was no difference in the median myeloid and platelet engraftment time and the rate of graft failure. The results showed that the incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD was higher in the ATG-6 group than in the ATG-10 group. But the EBV reactivation occurred more frequently in the ATG-10 group than in the ATG-6 group. The higher rate of infection and NRM may influence the transplant outcomes in this GVHD prophylaxis strategy. We speculated that low dose of ATG (5 mg/kg) will ensure the engraftment and decrease infection frequency. But the optimal timing of ATG administration still needed to be considered. The immunosuppressive activity of ATG is not only dose-dependent but also rely on the timing of drug administration, especially when the lower dose of ATG was used as GVHD Prophylaxis. So we designed a randomized control phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity with low dose ATG followed by low dose PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis .",UNKNOWN,,2017-05-30,2021-12-20,2020-05-20,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,100,ESTIMATED

NCT05198960,AVAJAK: Apixaban/Rivaroxaban Versus Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Thrombo-embolic Complications in JAK2V617F-positive Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,AVAJAK: Apixaban/Rivaroxaban Versus Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Thrombo-embolic Complications in JAK2V617F-positive Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,"Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are frequent and chronic myeloid malignancies including Polycythemia Vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) and Prefibrotic myelofibrosis (PreMF). These MPNs are caused by the acquisition of mutations affecting activation/proliferation pathways in hematopoietic stem cells. The principal mutations are JAK2V617F, calreticulin (CALR exon 9) and MPL W515. ET or MFP/PreMF patients who do not carry one of these three mutations are declared as triple-negative (3NEG) cases even if they are real MPN cases.

These diseases are at high risk of thrombo-embolic complications and with high morbidity/mortality. This risk varies from 4 to 30% depending on MPN subtype and mutational status.

In terms of therapy, all patients with MPNs should also take daily low-dose aspirin (LDA) as first antithrombotic drug, which is particularly efficient to reduce arterial but not venous events.

Despite the association of a cytoreductive drug and LDA, thromboses still occur in 5-8% patients/year.

All these situations have been explored in biological or clinical assays. All of them could increase the bleeding risk. We should look at different ways to reduce the thrombotic incidence: Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC)? In the general population, in medical or surgical contexts, DOACs have demonstrated their efficiency to prevent or cure most of the venous or arterial thrombotic events.

At the present time, DOAC can be used in cancer populations according to International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommendations, except in patients with cancer at high bleeding risk (gastro-intestinal or genito-urinary cancers). Unfortunately, in trials evaluating DOAC in cancer patients, most patients have solid rather than hematologic cancers (generally less than 10% of the patients, mostly lymphoma or myeloma).

In cancer patients, DOAC are also highly efficient to reduce the incidence of thrombosis (-30 to 60%), but patients are exposed to a higher hemorrhagic risk, especially in digestive cancer patients.

In the cancer population, pathophysiology of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events may be quite different between solid cancers and MPN. If MPN patients are also considered to be cancer patients in many countries, the pathophysiology of thrombosis is quite specific (hyperviscosity, platelet abnormalities, clonality, specific cytokines...) and they are exposed to a lower risk of digestive hemorrhages. It is thus difficult to extend findings from the ""general cancer population"" to MPN patients.

Unfortunately, only scarce, retrospective data regarding the use of DOAC in MPNs are available data.

We were the first to publish a ""real-life"" study about the use, the impact, and the risks in this population. In this local retrospective study, 25 patients with MPN were treated with DOAC for a median time of 2.1 years. We observed only one thrombosis (4%) and three major hemorrhages (12%, after trauma or unprepared surgery). Furthermore, we have compared the benefit/risk balance compared to patients treated with LDA without difference.

With the increasing evidences of efficacy and tolerance of DOAC in large cohorts of patients including cancer patients, with their proven efficacy on prevention of both arterial and venous thrombotic events and because of the absence of prospective trial using these drugs in MPN patients, we propose to study their potential benefit as primary thrombotic prevention in MPN.",,RECRUITING,,2022-07-13,2027-07-13,2027-07-13,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,1308,ESTIMATED

NCT01404260,Intercalating and Maintenance Use of Iressa Versus Chemotherapy in Selected Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,Intercalating and Maintenance Use of Iressa vs. Chemotherapy in Selected Advanced NSCLC: a Randomised Study,"Platinum-based combination chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine-carboplatin, is one of the standard first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) have clinical efficacy, as compared with the best supportive care or standard chemotherapy, when given as second-line or third-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.

Treatment with EGFR-TKI is most effective in female, never-smoker, or patients with adenocarcinoma, and patients of Asian origin. In these populations, such treatment is associated with favorable objective response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival. These populations also have a relatively high incidence of somatic mutations in the region of the EGFR gene that encodes the tyrosine kinase domain.

The recent study(IPASS) by Tony S. Mok showed gefitinib was superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia . In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the EGFR gene mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel(HR= 0.48,P\<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel(HR=2.85,P\<0.001). Gefitinib treatment was well tolerated, with lower in hematologic toxicity, and no treatment-related interstitial lung disease.In this study(IPASS), only patients with a mutation of the EGFR gene in the tumor could get benefit from gefitinib as first line treatment.

Tony S. Mok and his colleague also found that intercalating and maintenance administration of erlotinib(another EGFR-TKI)following gemcitabine/platinum chemotherapy as first line therapy led to a significant improvement in PFS .","Nowadays,EGFR mutation status is unknown for most of the advanced NSCLC patients in clinical practice.Those patients with high probability of EGFR mutation maybe could get benefit from gefitinib as first-line treatment. For this reason, the investigators need more investigation to focus on EGFR mutation unknown patients. In the previous study (including FAST-ACT), the patients enrolled trial received EGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy nearly simultaneously,so the investigators could not know whether those patients gained benefit from EGFR-TKI or chemotherapy, maybe chemotherapy alone was enough. If the patients with EGFR mutation status unknown could get stable disease(SD) after two cycles of chemotherapy,those patients may be optimal for the investigation of intercalating and maintenance administration of gefitinib. The reasons are that chemotherapy may be enough for those with objective response after two cycles chemotherapy, of course, those with disease progression (PD) should be excluded from the study.

On the basis of these and other studies, the investigators hypothesized that in a selected population,first-line chemotherapy(gemcitabine +carboplatin) with intercalating and maintenance use of gefitinib would be more efficacious than chemotherapy alone. In this study, the investigators compared the efficacy, safety, and adverse-event profile of chemotherapy plus gefitinib with those of chemotherapy alone, when these drugs were used as first-line treatment in nonsmokers or former light smokers in China, who had lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR gene mutation unknown.",COMPLETED,,2011-06,2015-10,2015-03,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,219,ACTUAL

The study will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation phase (Part A) and expansion phase (Part B).","Part A:

In this phase, dose escalation will start from 200 mg and the present 2 dose cohorts are 200 mg BID and 250 mg BID. Up to 12 subjects are expected to be enrolled in this part. In each cohort, all subjects will receive a single oral dose of IPG1094, followed by a 3-day single-dose PK study period.

The DLT evaluation period includes the single-dose PK study period and the first cycle of treatment (within 31 days after the first dose). The remaining subjects within the same cohort will be dosed if no significant safety signals are identified in the first subject in 3 days.

Starting at 200 mg cohort, 3 subjects will be enrolled initially at each subsequent dose cohort in accordance with the 3+3 dose-escalation design. After 3 subjects in each cohort completed DLT evaluation, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review all available safety and PK/PD data from all treated subjects (DLT evaluable and non-DLT evaluable subjects), taking into consideration the dose-assignment recommendation based on 3+3 decision rule (as described in the table below), to make the recommendation on the conduct of the study including the dose level and dose schedule for subsequent subjects.

Part B:

After all subjects in Part A completed DLT evaluations, the SMC will review all available safety, PK/PD and efficacy data from all treated subjects, to recommend 1 dose level for Part B. Phase B is an expansion study to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of IPG1094 in patients with several types of solid tumors, including but not limited to small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and melanoma (specific tumor types will depend on the results of Part A), with 12 subjects in each cohort.

Background: Treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has proven efficacy in two large randomized trials (MM-009 and MM-010) leading to a time to progression (TTP) of 17.1 months for patients with only one prior therapy and a TTP of 10.6 months for 2 and more prior therapies, respectively \[1-3\]. Continuous treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone until disease progression is therefore considered a standard therapy for second line treatment in multiple myeloma patients. However, only a relatively low rate of high quality response (CR, complete response and VGPR, very good partial response) is achieved. High quality responses are associated with with improved progression-free survival and overall survival \[4\].

Trial: The aim of this trial is to improve high quality response rates for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the 2nd line treatment. This aim shall be achieved by the addition a third anti-myeloma drug (bendamustine) to the established backbone of lenalidomide/ dexamethasone.

Treatment regimen:

* Induction Treatment Phase: Cycles 1-6 Bendamustine 75mg/m2/d day 1 and 2, lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21, dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg (for patients \> 75years) d 1, 8, 15, 22.
* Maintenance Treatment Phase: Cycles 7-18 lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21, dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg (for patients \> 75 years) d 1, 8, 15, 22.

Due to hematoxicity of bendamustine and lenalidomide, administration of pegfilgrastim is mandatory in the induction treatment phase (BRd-regimen)for all patients experiencing severe neutropenia.

The aim of this study is to achieve high quality response rates (CR, VGPR) of ≥ 40%. If this aim is achieved, the treatment of bendamustine in combination with the established lenalidomide/ dexamethasone regimen will be considered promising.

Besides efficacy, the safety of this three-drug regimen is evaluated in this trial.","Assessments for efficacy / response evaluation:

The liver is supplied by two vessels, the hepatic artery and the portal vein supplying 25% and 75% respectively of the total blood flow with 50% oxygen from each vessel. During liver resection it is standard practice to clamp both vessels(Pringle's manoeuvre), so as to avoid bleeding. Clamping both the vessels deprives the unaffected liver from nutrients required for survival. Reinstating the blood supply causes further damage by pouring harmful substances into the liver, which accumulate during the clamping. We hypothesize that not clamping the oxygen rich hepatic artery will cause less damage to the liver.

Our aim is to compare the Pringle manoeuvre with portal vein clamping, to identify if the latter will result in less tissue injury and thereby fewer complications. Initially we aim to conduct a pilot study. The main objective is to ensure that patients can be successfully recruited and that data capture is complete. The secondary outcomes will be development of infective complications by 30 days following surgery, bleeding and blood transfusion requirements, heart/chest complications, recovery of liver functions, growth of remnant liver, death within 30 days following surgery, length of high dependency unit/hospital stay and quality of life at 3 months after surgery.

There is published literature on the safety of this method and in the event of any intraoperative problems, the procedure will be converted to the standard Pringle manoeuvre.

NCT04328194,Autotaxin (ATX) as a Marker for Breast Cancer,Autotaxin (ATX) as a Marker for Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. According to the GLOBOCAN 2018 worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, in 2018, about 2,088,849 new cases were diagnosed and approximately 626,679 women were predicted to die from the disease . It is the leading cause of cancer related mortality, representing15% of deaths per year worldwide .","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females in Egypt. It accounts for 32 % of cancer in women . Breast cancer in Egypt carries an unfavorable prognosis with 29% mortality and 3.7:1 incidence to mortality ratio .

Despite the rising incidence of breast cancer, the survival rates have improved in recent years due to the deep research in biological behavior of breast cancer . Although the current 5-year survival for primary breast cancer is relatively high (ranging from 80% to 92% in different populations) survival rates decrease to less than 25% when the disease becomes metastatic .These data support the need to develop more efficient strategies for preventive, intervention, evaluation of therapy, and prediction of prognosis .

Autotaxin (ATX) is a glycoprotein encoded by the ENPP2 (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 2) gene located on chromosome 8. Identical to lysophospholipase D, ATX plays a role in the synthesis of the bioactive lipid mediator lysophosphatidate (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) .

LPA acts through specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to promote cellular proliferation, migration, and survival . ATX expression was also reported higher in poorly differentiated tumors and, in independent studies, is correlated with invasiveness of cancer cells suggesting a higher metastatic potential of ATX-expressing tumors . ATX is generated from platelets, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and adipocytes and specifically, ATX from adipocytes has an impact on plasma LPA level . Thus, adipocytes could be an important origin of ATX in tumors. Breast cancer is a human cancer that has adipocyte-rich stroma. Adipose tissue comprises 56% of non-lactating breast tissue, and 35% of lactating breast tissue . ATX-LPA signaling has been reported to be involved in angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and migration in breast cancer .

Increased ATX expression has also been reported in various forms of cancer, such as glioblastoma, hepatocellular and thyroid carcinomas, pancreatic and hematological cancers. A large number of evidence indicate that ATX-LPA is associated with chemotherapy resistance of cancer, and in breast cancer, ATX can reverse cell apoptosis.

In a mouse model, α-bromomethylene phosphonate LPA (BrP-LPA), a dual ATX and pan-LPAR( Lysophosphatidic acid receptor ) inhibitor, inhibited migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines and suppressed primary tumor and angiogenesis in a mouse xenograft study .

NCT06523894,Ablative SBRT in Elderly BC Patients,EASE (brEAst Stereo Elderly): A Phase Ia/Ib Study of Stereotactic Ablative Irradiation as an Alternative to Surgery in Elderly and Comorbid Breast Cancer Subjects,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a modern radiotherapy technique, through which extremely high doses of irradiation are delivered in a very precise manner, within a few fractions. SBRT is increasingly used into clinical practice because it can provide excellent local control, comparable to surgery, in many tumor locations, such as lung, liver or bone. Efforts to develop it for BC treatment are promising, as it is safe, convenient, and effective. To date, SBRT for BC has been developed as an alternative method of partial-breast irradiation (PBI) in the pre- or post-operative setting. Therefore, the doses tested are comparable to the conventional doses used with surgery although its potential as sole local treatment for BC remains unknown. Higher SBRT doses are expected to permit obtaining an ablative effect on tumor and be suitable as an alternative to surgery, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested.

The aim of the present study is to prove the feasibility of SBRT as an ablative treatment in early breast cancer (BC). The primary objective is to find the maximum tolerated dose of SBRT that can be safely administered in inoperable patients with BC, the majority of whom are elderly or oldest old.

The overall objective is to determine whether high precision, dose- and fractionation- adapted SBRT is feasible and safe in inoperable patients with BC. The dose and fractionation-adapted SBRT regimen permits to test feasibility in different tumor sizes.

The primary objective of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be delivered with a single or few (up to 5) fractions of SBRT in inoperable patients with BC.","SBRT will be performed using appropriate LINACs (Truebeam®, Varian, Palo Alto, US or Cyberknife®, Accuray, Morges, Switzerland) with a volumetric arc technique (VMAT), or non-coplanal technique, depending on the treating device. The medical devices have a CE certification and will be used in the trial as stated in the CE-marked instructions for use.

The gross tumor volume (GTV), as visualized on computed tomography (CT) within clips/fiducials, when present, with a 1mm (Cyberknife®)- 3mm (TrueBeam®) isotropic margin will be treated with an adaptive fractionation, depending on its total volume within 1,3 or 5 fractions. An elective volume of 2 cm around the GTV (clinical target volume (CTV)), plus a 1mm (Cyberknife®)- 3mm (TrueBeam®) isotropic margin will be treated at constant doses by fractionation cohort. These planning target volumes (PTVs) will be cropped at 5mm to skin and chest wall. The principle of irradiating an ""elective volume"" around the GTV will be used in this study, as done by Vasmel et al. \[3\]. This is decided because uncertainties do exist concerning true micro- and macrometastatic extension around the tumor, as visualized in the CT and delineation of the tumor on injected CT scans is not expected to be sufficient for coverage of macro and micrometastatic disease. Breast MRI is concordant to tumor size, as evaluated in pathology, within 0.5 cm for 53% of patients \[4\]. Organs at risk will be defined according to international guidelines \[5\].

Enrolment will be performed within 1-8 weeks after discussion in the HUG Breast Cancer Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (MTB).

All patients diagnosed with BC in our Institution, presenting the aforementioned characteristics, are candidates for screening for participation in the study, and will be offered clip placement, when feasible, during diagnostic biopsy by the specialized radiologist. Screening criteria will be assessed by the radiologist and radiation oncologist at the time of diagnostic biopsy.

Pre-screened patients will be discussed at the Institutional BC MTB. Eligible patients will be considered for the study.

Treatment procedures Treatment planning: Treatment planning will be performed using appropriate TPS (Eclipse®, (Varian, Palo Alto, US) or Accuray Precision®), with relevant techniques of SBRT in order to provide dose-delivery optimizations respecting predefined criteria for target coverage and normal-tissue constraints.

Accuracy issues: Accuracy of target volume delineation and dose delivery are of outmost importance for both tumor control and toxicity avoidance, given the limited number of fractions delivered. Accuracy issues are further detailed in the protocol section 3.4.1.

Quality assurance: A quality assurance (QA) program accompanies this trial, consisting of review of treatment plans by the trial medical physicist and the coordinating investigator.

SBRT fractionation will be adapted to PTV-GTV and PTV-CTV final volumes. With increasing volumes, more fractions will be used, according to the algorithm presented below, representing the dose-adapted fractionation regimens. SBRT will be delivered with isoeffective doses: a single fraction of 21, 23, or 25 Gy on day 1 or in three fractions of 11, 13 or 14 Gy/fraction on days 1, 3 and 5 or in five fractions of 8 or 9 or 10 Gy/fraction on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Dose per adaptive regimen will be escalated every three patients if no DLT appears.

In addition, patients will undergo physical exams at each study visit and (Serious) Adverse Events ((S)AE)s will be recorded. Questionnaires will be given to patients at selected study visits to assess Quality of Life (QoL).

A soybean oil emulsion, rich in the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid, will serve as control.","Rationale: Fish oil (FO), rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, exerts a range of anti-inflammatory actions that render it a potential therapeutic agent to treat Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the bowel. Recent evidence suggests that a lack of effect in previous studies might be due to the fact that genetic background was not taken into account. For instance, a study in healthy subjects showed that production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) following FO supplementation decreased in individuals within the highest tertile of pre-supplementational TNF-α production, remained unaltered in the middle tertile, and increased in the lowest tertile of pre-supplementational TNF-α production. TNF-α plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, hence the treatment with anti-TNF-α agents. Based on these notions, and because FO supplementation via the enteral route is strongly dose limited due to fat-induced side effects such as diarrhea, we hypothesize that parenteral FO supplementation might be beneficial in those patients with Crohn's disease with a high inherent TNF-α production.

Study design: Single center, randomized, single blinded, lipid-controlled, cross-over pilot trial.

Study population: Adult patients with Crohn's disease with previous bowel surgery, currently in remission (without the need for immunosuppressive drugs) and with a high inherent TNF-α production.

Intervention: First, patients with a high inherent TNF-α will be identified by assessment of TNF-α production in a group 100 patients who meet in- and exclusion criteria. Patients within the highest tertile will be classified as high producers. Next, 5 patients within the highest tertile will be randomized to receive intravenous administration of 20% (w/v) lipid-control (Intralipid®), and, after crossing over, 10% (w/v) fish oil emulsion (Omegaven®), or vice-versa for 1 hour on three consecutive days at a dose of 0.2 g/kg bodyweight /hr.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Early (T=day 4) and late (T=day 11) effects of infusions on TNF-α production by whole blood cultures. Secondary outcomes: effect on leukocyte counts, leukocyte functions and on (anti-)oxidant status, the occurrence of oxidative damage and analysis of specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) related to TNF-α production.",COMPLETED,,2014-01,2015-09,2015-05,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,SINGLE,TREATMENT,6,ESTIMATED

In this procedure, an average of 4 needle passes (needle sticks) is needed to collect enough tissue for diagnosis. However, the number of passes can be higher or lower, depending on the individual lesion and success of the needle passes.

If participant agrees to take part in this study, 2 different needles (the standard straight hollow-core needle and the new EchoTip® Procore™ needle) will be used to sample the pancreas lesion. Two (2) passes will be performed with each needle type and compared. If additional passes are needed for diagnosis, they will not be included in this study. After the first set of needle passes, the doctor may decide that more passes are needed.

Final test results will be taken from the diagnostic results from each needle pass. The results from both types of the needle will be included in the participant's medical record.

This is an investigational study. All needles used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available. Comparing the needles is investigational.

Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",COMPLETED,,2012-01-30,2017-07-06,2017-07-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,60,ACTUAL

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells, slow the growth of the tumor, and make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib and temozolomide with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.","PILOT STUDY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib administered with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or other grade 4 brain tumors who are currently on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC) therapy vs no EIAC therapy.

II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of 1-year survival, in these patients.

PHASE II OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

II. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

NCT04521894,The Application Value of 18F-prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT in Prostate Cancer,Diagnostic Performance of 18F-prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-1007 PET/CT in the Detection of Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common type of malignant tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among men worldwide. The biological behaviors of PCa at different degrees of malignancy also largely differ, directly impacting disease outcomes and responses to treatment. Therefore, accurate risk stratification of PCa before treatment and the development of an individualized treatment regimen, play a vital role to improve the clinical outcome of patients. However, overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies, which are invasive examinations associated with higher costs and adverse effects. When the PSA is less than 20ng/mL, less than 1% of PCa patients have a positive bone scan, and routine bone scans are not recommended for asymptomatic or low-risk PCa patients. Interestingly, due to the variations among evaluators that often occur when defining the T stage, biopsies operate inaccuracy, also low-PSA level can also occur metastasis, there is a need for an objective and accurate imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of different grade PCa.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane protein, which has higher expression in cancerous prostate cells than in normal prostate cells. Meanwhile, its expression level is positively correlated with the degree of malignancy, the tendency of metastasis, and the risk of early recurrence. In recent years, 18F-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PSMA PET/CT) has earned widespread attention as a novel imaging modality based on molecular-level analysis, rather than morphological or physiological analysis, to assist in PCa diagnosis and tumor burden evaluation.

Currently, Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) is the most commonly used semi-quantitative parameter in PET/CT, which is used to assess tumor burden of PCa, and thus can be used as an imaging biomarker to assess the degree of malignancy of prostate cancers. However, prior studies mainly focused on the correlation between patients' biochemical recurrence lesions and the PSA levels and Gleason score. There is a lack of research to explore the correlation among primary PCa burden, PSA levels, and the degree of prostate cancer malignancy. The aim of this project is to use 18F-PSMA PET/CT SUVmax to analyze the correlation among primary PCa imaging, and clinical indicators, and to evaluate the predictive value for PCa risk stratification, metastasis risk, and biochemical recurrence.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the highest malignant male tumor and one of the leading causes of mortality among men worldwide. The biological behaviors of PCa malignancy are largely heterogeneous, directly impacting prognostic grouping and treatment options. In addition, assessments of the distant metastatic status for PCa patients have recently received increasing attention due to the heightening mortality rate. Therefore, the precise systemic staging of primary PCa risk stratification before treatment plays a crucial role in designing the management strategy for the individualized treatment option. According to both American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, patients with total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) \> 20 ng/mL and/or Gleason Score ≥ 8 are high-risk, the probability of distant metastasis and mortality will increase significantly and may not suitable for active surveillance programs, radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy treatment. However, tPSA is organ-specific but not tumor-specific, the biological behaviors of prostate malignancy are largely heterogeneous, and the specificity of the ability of tPSA to reflect distant metastasis remains debatable. Using tPSA as the only indicator for risk stratification discrimination and distant metastases prediction may causing in large numbers of unnecessary prostate biopsies. Also, elderly patients with severe comorbidities or undergoing anticoagulation therapy may not be the optimal candidates for biopsies and may cause adverse effects and higher costs. In these cases, it is urgent to find objective and accurate imaging biomarkers for risk stratification classification with a noninvasive approach based on imaging analysis.

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is primarily expressed in prostatic tissues, and its expression is correlated with the degree of malignancy and further increases in metastatic. The ability of PSMA to easily penetrate tissues and diffuse with solid tumor lesions can reflect the statuses of metastasis. Prior studies show that PSMA PET/CT is superior to conventional imaging methods for lymph node metastatic detection and that the pre-treatment tPSA level and Gleason Score are associated with the PSMA uptake in primary PCa. Furthermore, the Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) is the most commonly used semi-quantitative parameter in PET/CT and prior studies have already been used to assess the degree of malignancy of PCa and predict extended pelvic lymph node metastases in intermediate to high-risk PCa patients by 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 68Ga-PSMA-617. 18F-PSMA-1007 is advantaged by its higher spatial resolution images and non-urinary excretion that reduces urinary clearance, this approach bears a great potential to facilitate the detection of primary PCa and metastatic lesions. However, to our knowledge, no prior studies have employed 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT to evaluate the diagnostic performance in risk stratification and distant metastases prediction in primary PCa.

The present study aims to retrospective investigated the role of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT semi-quantitative parameters correlation among newly diagnosed PCa imaging, tPSA levels and Gleason Score, and to evaluate the prediction performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and clinicopathologic characteristics on PCa risk stratification and distant metastatic prediction.",UNKNOWN,,2021-08-22,2023-08-31,2023-08-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,500,ESTIMATED

Statement of Problem

Despite the increasing knowledge concerning PCOS, the global picture of the disorder is deficient in a number of geographic regions. Understanding the global prevalence and phenotypic presentation of any common disorder, including PCOS, allows for:

1. A determination of the prevalence and associated morbidities of the disorder, to better assess the public health and economic implications of PCOS in this region.
2. A determination of the phenotype of PCOS in this region, allowing for improved screening methods.
3. The elucidation of underlying environmental or ethnic factors that may affect the prevalence, severity or complications of the disorder, via comparison of data between countries.
4. The elucidation of genetic variants underlying the disorder in this region, fostering and improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder and a better understanding of the evolutionary selection processes that have paradoxically resulted in the current high prevalence of the disorder in the face of obvious reproductive deficits.

Benefit These data would not only lead to an improved understanding of the public health implications of the disorder in Trinidad but also potentially highlight novel etiologic avenues and therapeutic targets.

Aims and objectives

Primary:

1. To determine the prevalence of PCOS among women of reproductive age (a selected population (18 to 45)) in Trinidad.

   Secondary
2. To determine the distribution of phenotypes among women diagnosed with PCOS in the above objective overall and by ethnicity. PCOS sub-phenotypes are as follows: Phenotype A - clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA) and oligi-/anovulation (OA), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM); B - HA and OA; C - HA and PCOM; and D - OA and PCOM;
3. To determine the risks for, metabolic syndrome, depression, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, fibroids, and general health issues for PCOS women versus women without PCOS in the age groups 18 - 45 years.
4. To determine the genotype of PCOS in Trinidad. Outcome measures and variables Outcome measures (dependent variables) c) Primary outcome ii) Prevalence of PCOS and its symptoms d) Secondary outcome iv) Phenotype of PCOS v) Genotype of PCOS vi) Prevalence and prevalence rationale for PCOS subphenotypes in Trinidad, odds ratio for metabolic syndrome, depression, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, fibroids, and general patient health issues, adjusted for age, ethnicity, BMI, treatment (OCP), and socioeconomic parameters.

   Covariates (independent variables)
   1. Socio-demographic variables
   2. Baseline characteristics

   Methodology Study design This is a prospective, cross-sectional study. The study will be conducted among females in Trinidad from different geographical locations.

   Study population Based on a review of nine studies conducted in the general population, a conservative prevalence estimate for PCOS, using the Rotterdam 2003 definition, is 13.4%. Based on this formula, a sample size of 495 untreated individuals will be required to determine the prevalence with an absolute error of 3%. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, 990 women would need to be approached for study inclusion. The study population will be females of reproductive age from Trinidad.

   Strategies for Sampling, Recruitment and Retention Participants will be samples proportionally from all 8 zones in Trinidad. Approximately 124 women in the reproductive age (18 - 45 years old) will be randomly sampled from each zone. Houses will be numbered and random numbers of these houses will be generated using a random number calculator. In each sampled house, females would be prescreened and those that satisfy our inclusion criteria would be selected.

   Telephone numbers of participants will be obtained and follow-up calls made.

   Sampling units are defined as individual unselected women between the ages of 18 and 45 years, identified in the community. The investigators target power analysis on women who do not use hormonal contraception. The investigators assume a conservative response rate of 50% of sampled women. This response rate includes the following parameters: use of hormone/contraceptive use (15%), excluded due to hysterectomy or ovariectomy (3%), excluded due to pregnancy (2%), refusal to participate (20%), and study drop-out/lost to follow-up (10%).

   A conservative prevalence estimate for PCOS based on a review of nine studies conducted in the general population using the Rotterdam 2003 definition is 13.4%. Using the above formula, a sample size of 495 individuals will be required to determine the prevalence with an absolute error of ±3%. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, 990 women would need to be approached for study inclusion.

   Selection criteria Inclusion criteria
   1. Female, ages 18 to 45 years., all ethnic backgrounds.
   2. The participants must have at least one of the following two features:

   i) Dermatological signs or complaints of clinical hyperandrogenism such as unwanted facial or body hair, loss of scalp hair (alopecia) or persistent acne (pimple).

   ii) Signs or complaints of ovulatory dysfunction such as irregular menses (oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhea or polymenorrhoea), history of anovulation or ultrasonographic findings of polycystic ovarian morphology.

   Exclusion criteria
   1. Women less than 18 years or older than 45 years
   2. Women who are pregnant at the time of evaluation
   3. Postmenopausal women
   4. Women who had undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy
   5. Anything that would place the individual at increased risk or preclude the individuals' compliance with or completion of the study.
   6. Unwillingness to participate or difficulty understanding the consent process or the study objectives and requirements.

      Sampling technique A consecutive sampling technique will be used for each phase of the study. Consecutive study participants, who meet the selection criteria and give informed written consent, will be recruited for the study. A unique serial identification number will be given to each study participant until the intended sample is attained.

      Study procedure Potential study participants from selected geographical locations will be invited to participate in the study. A confidential study register containing details of potential study participants (name, age, height, weight, blood pressure and contact phone number) will be kept. Potential study participants will be counseled on the objectives of the study and the study protocol. If the potential participant refuses to participate, no further contact will be made with the participant. Inform consent (see attached) will be obtained from each eligible study participant before recruitment for the study. A subject tracking log for longitudinal observation study will be used to track eligible subjects.

      After an informed consent, data will be collected from each study participant using a standard format in a clinical report form (CRF) for uniform data collection from all participants. Each CRF will contain a unique serial identification number. The CRF will be filled by a suitably trained researcher (including the PI, co-investigators and medically trained research assistants). All CRF will be checked for missing data within 24 hours of completion, and any missing data will be detected and collected immediately.

      Each participant will undergo anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist, circumference and hip circumference) and physical examination for hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans. Participants with an initial hirsutism (mFG) score of 3 or more will be re-assessed by a physician.

      Laboratory investigations will be scheduled during the morning hours (08:00 to 10:00 hours), for blood collection.

      After overnight fasting (of 8 hours or more), 10 ml of venous blood sample will be collected from each study participant. About half (5 ml) of the venous blood will be collected in an EDTA- containing tube for plasma/DNA and the remaining in a plain tube for serum.

      All blood samples will be stored and transported to the laboratory in cooler boxes containing ice packs immediately after collection. At the laboratory, the sample will be separated into serum, plasma and whole blood by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. The biological specimens will be stored, in small aliquots (of 0.5 ml), in 1.5 to 2.0 ml plastic containers (about 12 cryovials) able to withstand temperatures of -80 degrees.

      Samples for hormonal assay and initial evaluation will be batched at regular intervals for analysis to provide study participants with timely results, allow classification of participants, and minimize the impact of inter-assay variability. At the end of the study, a repeat analysis of biological samples for androgen levels and insulin estimation will be performed at a reference laboratory (Eric William Medical Science Complex).

      Each subject will also complete the following standardized data instruments or forms as appropriate: FG Score self-assessment, SF-12, and Beck depression inventory assessment (see attached).

      The genetic analysis will be performed at the Laboratory at the Department of Pre-clinical Sciences. The initial evaluation and classification of study participants will be done using the flow chart/diagnostic tree by Prof. Azzizz one of the investigators on this project.

      Related or mimicking disorders will be excluded using history, physical examination, and serum TSH, prolactin and 17-OH progesterone. Participants with hypothyroidism on thyroxine replacement therapy will not be recruited for the study until TSH level is normal. Study participants with elevated 17-OH progesterone 2ng/dl (or 200 ng/dl) will have non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH).

      Data collection instrument:

      The methods of collecting data for the assessment of study objectives include the use of standardized interview-based medical forms; surveys; physical examinations.

      The CRF developed for this study includes; a clinical and anthropometric section and a laboratory result section. The questionnaire section will seek information on socio-demographic variables, reproductive history with an emphasis on menstrual cycle (dating and regularity) and gynecological history, hirsutism, acne, medications, and family history. The anthropometry and clinical section will document the physical findings such as hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans. Subjects will also complete the following standardized data instruments or forms as appropriate: FG Score self-assessment, SF-12, Beck depression inventory, and Epworth sleepiness scale.

      A summary of initial and follow-up procedures.
      1. Physical Exam

         A physical exam will include:
         * Baseline medical examination and
         * Study specific procedures as outlined above.
      2. Baseline medical examination will include • Waist-to-circumference ratio

         * Height measurement
         * Weight measurement
         * Hirsutism assessment
         * Acne assessment
         * Alopecia assessment
         * Acanthosis nigricans assessment

           * Waist and hip circumferences measurement The following measures will be obtained with the subject standing: a) the waist circumference, measured as the circumferential measurement encompassing the lower borders of the 10th rib at the mid-axillary lines; and b) the iliac crest (hip) circumference, measured as the circumferential measurement obtained at the height of the iliac crests, with the tape maintained parallel to the floor. The waist and hip circumferences will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. The waist divided by the iliac crest (hip) circumference will be used to calculate the waist-hip ratio
           * Hirsutism assessment Hirsutism assessment will be performed using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual hirsutism score scale, by trained study personnel. Inter-reviewer variation will be assessed between study investigators. Photographic examples of each grade will be provided to investigators, as well as training to study personnel.

      mFG scoring will be performed as follows: • Nine body areas are assessed, including the upper lip, chin, chest, upper back, lower back, upper arm, upper and lower abdomen, and thighs.
      * A score of 0 to 4 is assigned to each area examined, based on the density of terminal hairs. A score of 0 represents the absence of terminal hairs, a score of 1 minimal terminal hair growth, a score of 2 mild terminal hair growth, a score of 3 moderate hair growth, and a score of 4 severe terminal hair growth (i.e., like that of a hairy man).

        o Terminal hairs represent hairs that if not cut or trimmed would grow \>5 mm in length, are usually pigmented, and are coarser and harder than the softer surrounding vellus hairs, as they have a compact medulla (core) of melanocytes within.
      * Each body area on the mFG form is circled accordingly, leaving those areas with a score of zero blank.

      The scores are summed up to for the 'Total modified FG score'. If patients use permanent/long term epilation or shave hairs, that fact will be recorded on the mFG score sheet.

      • In addition, all subjects will self-score their body and facial hair growth, marking on the mFG score sheet. The subjects will be provided the same mFG score sheet that is used by medical personnel, and will be instructed by trained personnel to circle on the sheet their own body areas they perceive to be affected by excess hair growth. Before they do so the trained personnel will provide them with a short instructional - covering how mFG is performed, what the scores 0 through 4 mean, what terminal hair growth means, and what each body area covers.

      - Acne assessment Assessment of acne will be made by trained personnel; using a standard acne lesion assessment.

      • Acne is scored according to whether it is grade 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). Mild acne is characterized by the presence of few to several papules and pustules, but no nodules.

      • Moderate acne by the presence of several to many papules and pustules, along with a few to several nodules.

      • Severe acne by the presence of numerous or extensive papules and pustules, as well as many nodules.
      * Alopecia assessment The Ludwig Scale will be used to diagnose the severity of female hair loss. From left to right in the image below, these Types include Class I, Class II, and Class III: (Attached)
      * Acanthosis nigricans assessment

        * All areas demonstrating acanthosis nigricans should be checked and indicated (see attached).
        * No score is used to denote severity.

3. Screening blood samples for evaluation PCOS Inclusion/Exclusion labs

* TSH\*\*
* PRL\*\*
* 17-OHP\*\*\*
* P4++
* oGTT\*\* \* To be determined in the local clinical lab (MDS Biochemistry Laboratory) in UWI, Trinidad.

  * All subjects. \*\*\* For subjects with oligomenorrhea and/or hirsutism and/or PCOM only, who do not use Hormonal Contraception (HC).

    * For subjects with hirsutism and/or PCOM, who have apparently regular menstrual bleeding a day 22-24 progesterone (P4) level will be obtained.

FUNCTIONAL TESTING Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Stimulation Test

An acute ACTH stimulation test is a clinical test performed to exclude 21-hydroxylase deficient nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH), if the screening (basal) 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-HP) level is 2 ng/mL (200 ng/dL) or 6.0 nmol/L. This test may also be performed on included subjects, such as controls, for further phenotyping. For androgen excess and/or PCOS patients, an ACTH stimulation test may be part of their standard clinical evaluation if basal 17-HP levels are elevated. The test will be performed as follows:

* The subject will come in between 7-10 am in the morning.
* A small indwelling catheter will be placed in a vein in an arm and a blood sample is drawn through the intravenous catheter (0 min sample).
* 250 mcg of 1-24 ACTH (Cortrosyn®) is then injected through the catheter. The injection is performed over 60 seconds by a physician.
* Sixty minutes after the injection, a second blood sample (60 min, sample) is drawn. • The total amount of blood drawn is 60 ml.

Laboratory evaluations and sample storage in research. Research lab

* SHBG
* Total and Free Testosterone
* DHEAS
* Blood for DNA extraction for later genetic analysis • Extra blood for repository

DNA Core Facility The investigators will obtain blood for DNA extraction since all subjects will undergo standard phenotyping. Blood (in EDTA tubes) will be sent to the Biochemistry Laboratory at Preclinical Sciences, UWI where DNA will be extracted and stored for future analyses. The primary purpose is to serve as a repository to participate in genome wide association studies. In both cases, there will be no release of personal identifiers, and we the investigaotrs will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality, as done in prior studies. This will be a part of the initial protocol, though subjects will have the option to opt out of this segment of the study or limit the use of their specimen on the consent form. This resource may also prove useful for genome wide association studies or other studies of the genetics of PCOS, oligomenorrhea, and hyperandrogenism.

At this time no genetic analyses are proposed as the number of subjects being collected are insufficient for any significant genetic study. However, as it is the investigators hope that this study will serve as the anchor for subsequent investigations of women's health and PCOS in Trinidad, the investigators intend to isolate and store DNA in the subjects examined in the study. The samples will be stored at The University of the West Indies. If in the future a decision is made to study the DNA samples accumulated, perhaps along with other samples collected, then we the investigators will apply for an amendment for genetic analysis.

NCT04990960,Experimental Study About Physiotherapy Treatment vs Self-treatment In Axillary Web Syndrome After Axillary Dissection,Experimental Study About Efficacy Of Physiotherapy Treatment vs Self-treatment In Axillary Web Syndrome After Axillary Dissection In Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND Dissection and removal of Lymph nodes in the Axilla (ALND) remains a method used in breast cancer management across the world. Post- surgical scar tissue that forms in this dissection is therefore beyond the linear scar, is characterized by less elasticity than healthy tissue and can over time, because of the anatomical location, cause significant limitations of the Active Range of Motion (AROM) of the scapulohumeral joint. After this procedure it's possible that Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) occurs. This study discusses the physiotherapy management of patients with AWS. The primary objective of the study was to verify direct and indirect changes to AWS cords with two treatment methods at a single breast cancer rehabilitation setting: Physiotherapist 's work Vs. Self-treatment.","Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women. Axillary surgical procedures have reported, with post-operative morbidity of bleeding, lymphedema and shoulder pain, also the rather underestimated Axillary Web Syndrome. The study shows that the reduction of the problems linked to the Syndrome such as pain in shoulder Abduction and Flexion and inability in everyday life is possible with an early and competent treatment. Two different approaches to the Syndrome were investigated. The patients were divided in two groups. Good results were obtained within 5 weeks since the appearance of AWS with both of them but if the Physiotherapist is able to teach the convenient exercises, the selftreatment seemed to have the best outcome. This fact can change the awareness that an early approach is necessary inside the path to recovery. In the last years the Axillary Web Syndrome was the topic of many studies: the etiology, its clinical diagnosis, the relation with lymphedema...But the treatment was often reported like a combination of different techniques without indications about kinds, times. Instead the investigators examined a detailed procedure, the same in both groups. The work was different only as regards the cords treatment. This fact shows the value of a comprehensive treatment for neck, shoulder, breast and two different but specific works on the Axillary Web Syndrome. For these reasons its publishing could be important for all the professionals working with women after Surgery for breast cancer and metastatic lymphnodes.",COMPLETED,,2017-10-01,2019-10-30,2019-09-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,19,ACTUAL

Pre-surgical chemotherapy has been advocated for these patients because of putative improvement in event-free survival (EFS). The advantages of pre-surgical chemotherapy include early administration of systemic chemotherapy, shrinkage of primary tumor, and pathologic identification of risk groups. The theoretic disadvantage is that it exposes a large tumor burden to marginally effective chemotherapy, especially in the axial region. The contribution of chemotherapy and surgery timing has not been tested rigorously. To study the effect of the timing of surgery on outcome of patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of pelvis and sacrum, we conducted multicenter randomized trial to determine whether chemotherapy administered before definitive resection of primary tumors improved EFS and overall survival compared with traditional resection of the primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.",UNKNOWN,,2018-08-01,2025-02,2020-02,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,100,ESTIMATED

Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating children who have refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate (overall and within strata) in both minimally pretreated, low-risk and heavily pretreated, high-risk children with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with ifosfamide and vinorelbine with filgrastim (G-CSF).
* Determine the cardiac, hepatic, renal, and hematologic toxicity of this regimen in minimally-pretreated, low-risk patients.
* Determine the toxic death rate in minimally pretreated, low-risk patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine whether this treatment regimen can mobilize sufficient hematopoietic stem cells (CD34) for subsequent stem cell transplantation in minimally pretreated, low-risk patients.
* Determine the incidence of hypermutability by longitudinal genotoxic biomonitoring of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the prognostic significance of biological markers, including serum interleukin (IL)-10 receptor, serum IL-2 receptor, p53, and mdm-2 in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by prior therapy (minimally pretreated, low-risk vs heavily pretreated, high-risk).

Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 and vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV over 15-30 minutes beginning 24-36 hours after completion of vinorelbine and continuing daily until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats at least every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive a third course of therapy at the discretion of the investigator.

Heavily pretreated, high-risk patients who achieve a complete response are eligible for stem cell transplantation. Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection during hematopoietic recovery after the second course of chemotherapy. Patients with sufficient PBSCs collected may undergo PBSC transplantation on protocol COG-AHOD0121.

Pneumatic compression devices are also known as sequential compression devices and are inflatable compression sleeves that are placed around patient's legs to reduce the risk of clot formation deep vein thrombosis. Pneumatic compression devices are made of a soft material that wraps around the lower leg and periodically squeeze the calf. A deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot. Most hospitalized patients wear these as a preventive measure. Pneumatic compression devices alone are not sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis formation. Therefore, medicines, such as aspirin and enoxaparin are utilized. Both drugs are used for prevention, but there are no studies in patients with musculoskeletal tumors which have determined whether one drug is better than another. The knowledge gained from this study will determine whether aspirin and pneumatic compression devices is the same or better than enoxaparin and pneumatic compression devices in preventing deep vein thrombosis in this patient population and may result in fewer wound and bleeding complications","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To perform a randomized prospective study to determine efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)+pneumatic compression device (PCD) prophylaxis compared to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)+PCD in patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures for musculoskeletal neoplasms (MSN) of the pelvis and lower extremity.

II. To prove that ASA+PCD is clinically equivalent to or better than LMWH+PCD in providing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in this patient population and results in fewer major bleeding complications.

III. To measure rates of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) as primary outcomes.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To measure secondary outcomes including rates of readmission, reoperation, bleeding complications (including hematoma formation and prolonged wound drainage), and death.

NCT02285660,Evaluation of 4D-contrast Enhanced PET-CT in Tumour Volume Definition,"Evaluation of 4D-contrast Enhanced PET-CT in Tumour Volume Definition for Patients With Lung, Lower Oesophageal and Pancreatic Carcinomas.","The aim of high dose radiotherapy treatment is to deliver enough radiation to the tumour to kill all the cancer cells while at the same time giving a low dose of radiation to the normal parts of the body to reduce the side effects of treatment. This requires the cancer specialist to accurately identify the areas of cancer on a computed tomography (CT) scan. Positron emission tomography computed tomography (PETCT) scans use radioactive sugar that is injected into the patient. This sugar goes into cancer cells and shows up as a bright spot on the PET scan, allowing the doctors to see tumours more accurately. Some cancers move with breathing, for example lung, pancreas and oesophageal (or gullet) cancers. Fourdimensional CT scanning (4DCT) is a special type of CT scan that allows the motion of the tumour to be seen and measured accurately. This information can then be used to help ensure that the radiotherapy correctly treats the moving tumour.

The aim of this study is to see if there are possible benefits to combining PET with 4DCT to get a 4D PETCT scan for tumours that move with breathing. This study is divided into three cancer types; lung, lower oesophagus and pancreatic cancer.

First the investigators are going to test the use of 4D PETCT in the radiotherapy planning of these tumours to see if it helps the doctor to identify the cancer.

Secondly, the investigators are going to see if the 4D PETCT helps to show areas within the cancer that are potentially more active. This might then allow us to target a higher dose to these areas, which could potentially improve the chance of controlling and curing the cancer.

For each arm of the study the following sample size is required:

* First step: 23 patients, for a total of 69 patients in all 3 arms
* Second step: further 33 patients, for a total of 168 patients in all 3 arms.","Treatment Plan Patient will continue to be treated with the same hormone therapy at the same dose, route and schedule

Patients will be randomized to receive:

A: Lapatinib, 1250 mg/die, os B: Metformin, 1500 mg/die, os C: Lapatinib + Metformin, 1250 mg+1500 mg/die, os Patients will receive study treatment until disease progression is documented, extraordinary medical circumstances occur, intolerable toxicities occur, or the patient withdraws consent

Statistical consideration Randomization will be stratified according to the site of metastases: visceral versus non-visceral lesions. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of patients free of disease progression at 3 months from randomization. The final analysis of this objective will be conducted when a total of 168 patients are enrolled across the three arms. This is the number of patients needed for a test with an experiment-wise alpha = 0.05 and power = 80% to show a statistically significant increment of 10% to the rate of patients without disease progression at 3 months, assuming a rate of 5% for treatments without lapatinib and/or metformin (P0=5% and P1=15%). After having accrued a total of 23 evaluable patients in each arm, the trial design can proceed to step 2 randomizing additional patients to each arm only if two or more patients are free of disease progression at 3 months. Otherwise, the study arm with less than expected responses will be discontinued. In the second stage 33 additional patients will be enrolled in each study arm to reach a total of 56 total patients per arm. If less than 6 patients per arm will be free of disease progression then the increment of corresponding treatment will be considered not significant.

Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However, hormone pills usually work for about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on, breast cancer will start to grow again. This condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called ""endocrine resistant"" breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests, the investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make letrozole work again. However, it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in humans.

The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole, lapatinib, and everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work.

Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of breast cancer called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. HER2 is a protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also include patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these patients do not depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is considered experimental.

Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer. Initial studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that everolimus may also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental in this study.","This is a single-institution clinical trial. Patients will be stratified according to the HER2 status:

Group 1: HER2-positive in the tumor tissue Group 2: HER2 negative in the tumor tissue

In the first part of the study, all of the patients will receive the combination of lapatinib 1,500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. We do not expect any significant toxicity from this combination since the previous study of lapatinib and letrozole showed that this combination is safe with no grade 3-4 toxicities observed. Restaging scans (CT scan, MRI, or bone scan) will be obtained after every 12 weeks of treatment.

NCT05451576,Sodium Selenite Supplementation in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer,The Role of Sodium Selenite Supplementation in Patients With Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy,"The micronutrient selenium is an essential trace element in the human body. There are more than 25 proteins in the human body contain selenium, such as glutathione peroxidase and selenoprotein, which regulate the body's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous literatures had shown cancer patients have lower serum selenium concentrations than normal people, and lower serum selenium levels may be associated with increased cancer mortality. More than 50% of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are malnourished before treatment, and these patients often have deficiency of trace elements, including selenium. In these malnourished patients, they may have to endure increased treatment toxicity and treatment interruption when receiving standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Interruption of treatment may lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy and compromised survival and recurrence rate. Several small studies have investigated whether oral administration of sodium selenite in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy can improve side effects and affect survival rates, but the results are inconsistent. Our study will use the intravenous form of sodium selenite (Zelnite®) to investigate the effect of selenium on the treatment outcomes of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing CCRT, such as therapy-related toxicities, quality of life, changes in selenium concentration in blood, nutritional, inflammation and immune markers, and tracking long-term survival and recurrence rates.","Selenium is an essential trace element for humans. It is involved in redox regulation, antioxidant functions, membrane integrity, and protection against DNA injury. In both animal models and human studies, it has been shown that selenium has cancer-protective effects and cytoprotective activities. Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the anti-cancer effects of selenium, which include the antioxidant properties by selenoproteins, induction of conjugating enzymes that detoxify carcinogens, enhancement of the immune response, alterations in DNA methylation and blockage of the cell cycle to allow DNA repair.

There has been conflicting response regarding selenium supplementation on the reduction of toxicity, antitumor efficacy and their quality of life in patients receiving radiotherapy. In the studies by Kiremidjian-Schumacher et al. and Elango et. al, sodium selenite supplementation was shown to significantly enhance cell-mediated immune responsiveness and improve defense systems in head and neck cancer patients. Micke et al. and Zimmerman et al. demonstrated the quality of life of patients suffering from head and neck cancer with lymphedema significantly improved after selenium supplementation. In the study by Büntzel et al., selenium supplementation reduced the radiation-associated side-effects of dysphagia developments in patients with head and neck cancer patients.

However, some studies showed negative response of selenium supplementation in head and neck cancer patients. Weijl et al. showed oral selenium supplementation did not show improvement in cisplatin-induced toxicity or response rate in cancer patients. In the study by Mix et al., addition of oral selenium supplementation was well-tolerated but did not lower the incidence of severe mucositis or improve quality of life or survival outcomes in head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiation (CRT). An early systematic review in Cochrane demonstrated there was still insufficient evidence to conclude efficacy of selenium in alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of intravenous selenium supplementation on the treatment outcome of head and neck patients undergoing CCRT (toxicities, quality of life, overall survival, progression-free survival), selenium concentration changes during CCRT, and its correlation with nutritional, inflammation and immune markers.",RECRUITING,,2020-08-12,2024-06-30,2023-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,60,ESTIMATED

A combination of vitamin D and celecoxib act synergistically to decrease breast cancer risk by decreasing cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium through their action on prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism.

Specific Aims:

In women at increased breast cancer risk, determine the effect of vitamin D, with or without celecoxib, on

1. PG synthesis and metabolism, through the measurement of 15-PGDH, COX-2, and PGE2 in the breast

   Rationale: 1,25(OH)2D, the active form of vitamin D, has been shown in vitro to decrease PGE2 both by interfering with its production and by increasing its breakdown, leading to lower cell proliferation. Celecoxib potentiated the antiproliferative effect, allowing a much lower dose of each agent when used in combination than in isolation.
2. Proliferative activity in the breast, as measured by Mammary Ductoscopy (MD) cell morphology

   Rationale: Both MD and Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) contain ductal epithelial cells, but MD samples contain more cells for cytologic review than NAF. Findings on MD cytology correlate with likelihood of breast cancer (2), NAF cytology relates to breast cancer risk and improves risk stratification (3), and bioactive food components can alter NAF cytology (4).

NCT00341276,Esophageal Cancer Genetics Studies,Esophageal Cancer Genetics Studies,"The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of genetics in the etiology and prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancer, primarily esophageal cancer, but also cancers of the gastric cardia and body.

Esophageal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in China and the seventh most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in the etiology of this malignancy, and identification of esophageal cancer susceptibility genes may allow screening of populations to identify persons at particularly high risk, who could then be targeted for prevention strategies (e.g., chemoprevention or early detection). There are several lines of evidence supporting the idea that there is genetic susceptibility for esophageal cancer in high-risk Chinese populations, including an association of positive family history with increased risk, evidence of familial aggregation of cases, and segregation analyses suggesting Mendelian inheritance in high-risk families.

Several different but complementary approaches will be used to identify esophageal cancer susceptibility genes. (Because of etiologic similarities and for logistic reasons, parallel efforts will be made with gastric cardia and body cancers.) First, a tumor/non-tumor study will be conducted in which a biological specimen bank consisting of samples (tumor, non-tumor, venous blood, finger stick blood, and buccal cells) from several hundred cases of esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric body cancers will be developed in Taiyuan that can be used for the identification of esophageal (as well as gastric cardia and body) cancer susceptibility genes and potential early genetic markers of these cancers. High-density genome-wide scans with microsatellite markers will be used in a limited number of cases to identify potential hot spots followed by further testing of these hot spots and other candidate markers in additional tumor/non-tumor samples. Premalignant morphologic lesions will also be examined. Second, blood samples for DNA will be collected from approximately 100 healthy individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas to examine potential population differences in polymorphisms for selected genomic markers. Third, a large case-control study with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and body of stomach will be conducted to evaluate polymorphisms in the candidate markers identified in other components of this project, and to evaluate gene-environment interactions. Finally, a family study will be conducted to evaluate linkage of candidate markers with cancer in families having 2 or more cases with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and/or body of stomach.","The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of genetics in the etiology and prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancer, primarily esophageal cancer, but also cancers of the gastric cardia and body.

Esophageal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in China and the seventh most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in the etiology of this malignancy, and identification of esophageal cancer susceptibility genes may allow screening of populations to identify persons at particularly high risk, who could then be targeted for prevention strategies (e.g., chemoprevention or early detection). There are several lines of evidence supporting the idea that there is genetic susceptibility for esophageal cancer in high-risk Chinese populations, including an association of positive family history with increased risk, evidence of familial aggregation of cases, and segregation analyses suggesting Mendelian inheritance in high-risk families.

Several different but complementary approaches are proposed to identify esophageal cancer susceptibility genes. (Because of etiologic similarities and for logistic reasons, parallel efforts will be made with gastric cardia and body cancers.) First, a tumor/nontumor study will be conducted in which a biological specimen bank consisting of samples (tumor, nontumor, venous blood, finger stick blood, and buccal cells) from a total of approximately 150 cases each of esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric body cancers will be developed in Taiyuan that can be used for the identification of esophageal (as well as gastric cardia and body) cancer susceptibility genes and potential early genetic markers of these cancers. Comparative genomic hybridization and microsatellite markers will be used to scan the genome in up to 20 cases to identify potential hot spots followed by further testing of these hot spots and other candidate markers in additional tumor/nontumor samples. Second, blood samples for DNA will be collected from approximately 100 healthy individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas to examine potential differences in polymorphisms for selected genomic markers. Third, a casecontrol study will be conducted to evaluate hot spots and candidate markers identified from the tumor/nontumor study and potential gene-environment interactions. Finally, a linkage study will be conducted by identifying and collecting information and DNA from cases and first degree relatives in special highly informative families (those with 2 or more cases having obtainable DNA) as well as population-based ascertainment and collection of information and DNA from all new cases from Yangcheng County.",COMPLETED,,1995-07-06,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,7705,ACTUAL

NCT05629494,Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Test,Effect of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs on Serum Prostate Specific Antigen Level,"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men in the Unites States. Nearly 1 million prostate biopsy procedures are performed in the United States annually and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is the primary reason for prostate biopsy in \> 90% of cases. However, at the PSA levels which trigger prostate biopsy, often no cancer is found in prostate biopsy specimens. PSA test can be elevated due to reasons other than cancer such as inflammation or natural variation in the level. Investigators plan to treat men with elevated PSA level with over the counter anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, naproxen) to see if the PSA level will decrease to an acceptable level.","It's known that PSA level can be elevated due to reasons other than prostate cancer including benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis or other urinary tract infections, non-infectious inflammation, and physiologic variation over time. Consequently, nearly 50% of prostate biopsy procedures performed due to elevated PSA level do not yield any cancer , but still expose the patients to the risks of the procedure related complications (discomfort/pain, anxiety, bleeding, infection, and cost). Thus, measures to improve the reliability of PSA test, and potentially avoiding unnecessary procedures, are of significant importance to the patient and healthcare system.

It is common practice to check PSA level annually. PSA test results can vary over time, either due to the imprecision in the analysis and/or due to the biologic variability. This can result in an apparent rise in PSA level when no clinically meaningful rise had occurred. Its estimated that the average lab variation in PSA was approximately 6% and the average biologic variation about 14%. This, it is recommended that isolated elevation in PSA level should be confirmed after several weeks, and before proceeding with further interventions, including prostate biopsy.

Sub-clinical, histologic Inflammation (presence of inflammatory cells) within the prostate tissue and its effect on PSA level has been reported in various settings. In two population-based studies, men who were regularly using over the counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g ibuprofen, naproxen) had lower PSA levels compared to non-users.

Currently, two strategies are utilized in clinical practice to ensure that the PSA level is truly elevated:

1. Repeat PSA test after several weeks or
2. A short course of OTC NSAIDs, and then repeat PSA test

Investigators propose to conduct a randomized study to determine the effect of NSAIDs on PSA level compared to the biologic variations in PSA level noted upon repeat testing.",RECRUITING,,2022-09-27,2026-12-01,2026-03-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,198,ESTIMATED

This study will enroll approximately 480 patients with unresectable advanced ICC who have received no prior systemic therapy. Patients who meet the requirements will be randomly assigned to Treatment Arm A: Toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or Treatment Arm B: Toripalimab, oral placebo, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or Treatment Arm C: Intravenous placebo, oral placebo, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.

All patients will receive standard chemotherapy (GEMOX or GC per Investigator decision) for a maximum of 8 cycles. After the completion of standard chemotherapy, all patients continue to receive maintenance therapy with toripalimab injection or its placebo in combination with lenvatinib mesylate capsule or its placebo until unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression and loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigators, start of new anti-cancer therapy, death, other conditions requiring termination of study treatment, or the patient meets the criteria for study withdrawal, whichever occurs first.

In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for unconfirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving toripalimab, lenvatinib, or their placebos will be permitted to continue treatment if their clinical status or symptoms are stable or improved (as determined by the investigators) or until loss of clinical benefit. Patients with confirmed disease progression should discontinue toripalimab, lenvatinib, or their placebos.

Tumor assessments will be performed at screening and during the study treatment per protocol. In the absence of progression, tumor assessments will continue as scheduled, regardless of whether study treatment ends, until confirmed disease progression or other criteria for study withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first. Patients who meet RECIST v1.1 criteria for progression should undergo tumor assessments as scheduled if clinical benefits of continuing study treatment are determined by investigators until progression is confirmed per iRECIST (iCPD), or the criteria for study withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.

Computerized tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for efficacy evaluation will be performed at baseline, every 6 weeks (Q6W) in the first year (52 weeks), and every 9 weeks (Q9W) in the second year (after week 52).

All AEs and concomitant medications during the study will be recorded. An end-of-treatment (EOT) visit will be performed within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or termination of study treatment is confirmed by the investigator.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine administered as an intratumoral injection in treating patients with stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

Secondary

* To determine the biologic and clinical responses to therapy.
* To determine treatment-related toxicity using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.
* To identify the MTD.
* To monitor patients for evidence of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine-induced cytokines and antigen-specific immune responses.
* To detect immune responses to tumor-associated antigens and vector.
* To assess patients for objective signs of tumor regression (RECIST Criteria).

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine.

Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain leukocytes for generation of autologous dendritic cells (DC). Adenovirus carrying the CCL21 gene is added to the dendritic cells to make the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks after leukapheresis, patients receive an intratumoral injection of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine under CT-guidance or by bronchoscopy on days 0 and 7. Patients demonstrating a clinical response are eligible to receive a second round of gene transfer at their discretion and in consultation with the FDA.

Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. An additional 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then on days 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 for safety and immunological studies. Blood samples are analyzed for mycoplasma by PCR; dendritic cell phenotype by flow cytometry; detection of adenovirus CCL21 by nested PCR; and adenoviral antibodies by ELISA. Patients also undergo tissue aspirate or biopsy on days 0 and 7 (during bronchoscopy or CT-guided procedure). Tissue samples are analyzed for immune-modulating cytokines (i.e., IFNγ, CXCL9, and CXCL10) by quantitative RT-PCR; detection of tumor infiltrating leukocytes by immunohistochemistry; CD83+ DC, CXCR3, CCR7, CCL21 and CD3+ T-cells, CD4, and CD8 by flow cytometry; determination of tumor expression of tumor-associated antigen by RT-PCR; and evaluation of immune modulation by ELISPOT assays.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of nasopharyngeal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving bevacizumab together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

NCT06295094,The Efficacy of PIPAC and Minimally Invasive Radical Resection in High-risk Gastric Cancer Patients.,"The Efficacy of Pressurised Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) Combined With CURativE Intent Minimally Invasive Radical Resection in High-risk Gastric Cancer Patients. A Multicentre, Randomised, Open-label Phase-II Study","The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate whether pressurized intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIPAC), delivered immediately after minimally invasive D2 gastrectomy and repeated 6-8 weeks later, improves 12-month peritoneal disease-free survival in patients with high-risk gastric adenocarcinoma when compared to standard treatment.","Despite declining incidence, gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is considered the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death globally. Its incidence varies across different parts of the globe, with a low incidence in the West. In East Asia, especially Japan and Korea, the incidence of distal GAC remains high, whereas proximal GAC tends to dominate in the West. Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas that have the epicentre in the proximal 2 to 5 cm of the stomach (Siewert type III) should be staged and treated as GAC.

The consensus in most Western countries is that medically fit GAC patients should undergo D2 gastrectomy, carried out in specialised, high-volume centres with perioperative outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality rates comparable to those presented in Japan and South Korea. A minimally invasive D2 gastrectomy has emerged as a valid and preferable alternative to open surgery.

Despite significant progress in implementing preventive strategies and curative treatment of premalignant and early neoplastic gastric lesions, most GAC patients still present with advanced stages of the disease, leading to a dismal prognosis even after treatments with curative intent. Given that many patients relapse following surgery, various multimodal treatment strategies have been studied to improve survival rates, mainly by combining surgery with systemic treatment in the form of perioperative chemotherapy. Clinical research has explored and documented the concept of perioperative chemotherapy in GAC and cancers originating in the distal esophagus and GEJ. Noteworthy is that some of these have suggested that the tumours with the most obvious responses to corresponding regimens originate in the esophagus and GEJ. Moreover, GACs of poorly differentiated tubular type or poorly cohesive cancer, regardless the presence of signet-ring cells type has been reported to be more resistant to chemotherapy regimens. Another observation with clinical implications is that GAC patients with malignant cells retrieved from peritoneal lavage before surgery have an extremely poor prognosis. Hence, laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage for malignant cells is recommended in all stage IB-III gastric cancers, otherwise considered potentially resectable, to exclude radiologically occult metastatic disease. The true value of this information may be even greater for patients with T3/T4 disease. Considering the above-mentioned challenges, it is critically important to explore novel multimodal therapeutic concepts in GAC since current therapeutic strategies offer these patients a limited option for cure.

The occurrence of peritoneal metastases (PM) has a significant negative impact on the overall prognosis, with a median survival of three to four months without treatment. None of the available chemotherapy regimens has reduced or prevented the risk of PM. It is commonly believed that PM occur through the deposition of tumour cells either by the direct extension and subsequent cellular exfoliation or through the traumatic dissemination of cancer cells during surgery. Clinical validation of the concept of direct spread is also provided by observing the higher rate of PM seen with increasing tumour stages (T-stages) and serosal involvement. This is also supported by the association of between positive peritoneal cytology and a higher tumour stage.

Sixty percent of lavage cytology-negative patients will convert to a cytology-positive state immediately after gastrectomy. Accordingly, it can be argued that during gastrectomy, cancer cells within the dissected lymphatic channels and blood vessels are released to and disseminated throughout the abdominal cavity. Free cancer cells can then attach to the peritoneal surface, a process facilitated by the action of cytokines and the deposition of fibrin layers, allowing for the entrapment of those cells. This new restrictive-peritoneal environment is thought to hinder the penetrance of cytotoxic drugs delivered systemically and provides grounds for the launch of intraperitoneal treatments.

Based on the minimal effects of traditional regimens on GAC, exploring alternative perioperative therapeutic concepts appears of the highest clinical significance. Since only a fraction of the systemically administered chemotherapy reaches the peritoneum, the effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been extensively studied. A new aerosol technique, Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC), improves intraperitoneal delivery and subsequent uptake of chemotherapy. It has shown promising results in patients with PM from colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. Furthermore, PIPAC is feasible, safe, and well tolerated by many patients when administered in the palliative setting.

Randomised studies on prophylactic treatment of high-risk GAC patients (serosal invasion) using intraperitoneal chemotherapy or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are mainly from Asian institutions. The risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality did not seem to be negatively influenced by intraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, contrasting to western non-randomized trials reporting considerable morbidity and mortality after these combined procedures. Thus, the use of prophylactic HIPEC in non-metastatic high-risk GAC is still debated.

Data from Odense PIPAC Centre on the outcome of PIPAC with low-dose cisplatin and doxorubicin in GAC patients with chemotherapy-resistant PM revealed objective tumour response in 40% of the patients after three PIPAC directed therapies. An additional 20% had no further tumour progression. These observations in GAC patients deliver further evidence suggesting that PIPAC can induce regression of resistant PMs in several cancer types and carries the potential to meet the clinical need for new and better therapies. Our results also provide evidence that low-dose PIPAC therapy might effectively treat patients with recurrent, chemo-resistant gastric PMs, including the poorly differentiated tubular type or poorly cohesive cancer.

The pivotal question is whether PIPAC delivered immediately after a laparoscopic D2 gastrectomy for GAC can reduce the risk of recurrent PM. Our institutions' recent phase I trial has shown this therapeutic concept to be feasible and safe. Hence, a randomised phase-II clinical trial must be conducted to assess the impact of PIPAC on disease-free survival in patients with high-risk GAC who are offered surgical treatment with curative intent.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-09,2028-01,2027-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,264,ESTIMATED

NCT02571894,The Cardio-Oncology Breast Cancer Study,"Effects of Identifying and Treating Early, Subclinical Cardiotoxicity on the Long-Term Incidence of Clinical Cardiotoxicity in Women With Breast Cancer, A Prospective Randomized Study: The Cardio-Oncology Breast Cancer Study (COBC)","The main objective of this randomized controlled trial is to test the association between standard cardiac risk factors, biomarkers and parameters of echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, (predictors) and subsequent occurrence, frequency and severity of clinical or subclinical cardiotoxicity (outcome) within and between-groups, before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years after the completion of the chemotherapy among women with early breast cancer.","Rationale for the study:

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Swedish women, accounting for a third of all cancer cases among females. The breast cancer incidence has increased from 2596 to more than 8000 breast cancer diagnosis 2011. During the past 40 years, the age-adjusted incidence has doubled. Early adjuvant therapy reduces the risk of dying with about 50%. (Early adjuvant therapies; chemotherapy, antibodies, endocrine therapy, and radiotherapy). Treatment advances have improved survival rates, but treatment-related cardiotoxicity (CT) remains a substantial problem.

In general, earlier treatment of cardiotoxicity offers the best chances of preventing or ameliorating clinical cardiotoxicity. Risk factors should be modified or reduced by treating elevated blood pressure, normalizing lipids, encouraging weight reduction and smoking cessation. Patient-tailored therapy is now possible, especially given the availability of different chemotherapy regimens, safer anthracycline analogs such as liposomal doxorubicin, and cardioprotective medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and b-blockers. It is now suggested that new cardiac biomarkers and ultrasound techniques can detect cardiotoxicity in its early, subclinical, stages. The investigators hypothesized that biomarkers can be used to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity and that detecting early signs of cardiotoxicity might reduce the number, time-to-onset, and severity of cardiotoxic events.

In present proposal the investigators aim in a randomized study to compare primary cardiac preventive measurements versus standard care.

Objectives of the trial:

1. Primary objective In a randomized study to investigate the cumulative incidence of cardiotoxic events, per randomized arm, before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years after the completion of the chemotherapy.
2. Secondary Objectives To compare the number, time-to-onset, and severity of cardiotoxic events in an experimental group assessed and treated for subclinical cardiotoxicity before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years after the completion of the chemotherapy and a control group receiving standard of care without early assessment for subclinical cardiotoxicity. Data on the same variables will be collected from both groups before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years. Data from the experimental group will be used in real time to guide therapy, but data from the control group will be not be analyzed until after the end of the study.

To assess subclinical cardiotoxicity with serum concentrations of biomarkers, tissue Doppler and strain echocardiography, electrocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging, as well as with standard cardiac risk assessment based on standard risk factors: a history of heart disease, increasing age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, parasternal radiotherapy, and the cumulative dose of anthracyclines and trastuzumab.

To assess the association between primary treatment of existing standard cardiac risk factors, biomarkers and parameters of echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, (predictors) and subsequent occurrence of clinical or subclinical cardiotoxicity of cardiotoxicity (outcome) within and between-groups, over time.

Thus, the investigators will study the effects of an inhospital exercise intervention combined with lifestyle--including diet--counselling along the duration of treatment (neoadjuvant \[solid tumours\]/intense chemotherapy \[leukaemias\], expected median duration 5-6 months) on several health-related variables.

Setting and Methods. Participants will be recruited from 4 hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Inclusion criteria: male/female aged 12-19 years, newly diagnosed with a malignant extracranial tumour; not having received any type of therapy--except surgery--at the time of diagnosis; adequate health status (Karnofsky/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale score ≥50/2); to understand Spanish language and to provide written informed consent. The investigators will recruit ≥136 participants and conduct a randomised controlled trial (1:1 ratio randomisation with a block on gender and tumour type \[leukaemias/lymphomas\]). In addition to usual care, the control group will be informed of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. The intervention group will follow a physical exercise and lifestyle counselling program. The exercise intervention will be performed in the hospital gymnasium (3 sessions/week of aerobic and resistance exercises), except for neutropenic phases--during which time sessions will be performed in the patients' ward--and will also include inspiratory muscle training (5 days/week). Health counselling will include a psychological intervention (1 session/week) based on motivational interviewing techniques, guidance by a nutritionist (2 sessions/month), and support sessions (1/month) with survivors (≥5-year survivorship) who will share their experiences with the study participants. The following outcomes will be assessed at baseline (diagnosis), end of treatment, and at 3-month follow-up in all participants: echocardiography-determined left ventricular function (primary outcome); and other echocardiographic variables, cardiometabolic biomarkers, blood pressure, blood lipids, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-determined body composition (fat \[including visceral adipose tissue\]/lean mass, bone mineral content/density), energy intake, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, functional mobility, health-related quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, clinical variables (survival, treatment tolerability, hospitalisation length), and potential biological underpinnings of exercise multisystemic benefits (cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, gut microbiome, and immune function \[lymphocyte subpopulations, natural killer cell cytotoxicity\]) (secondary outcomes).",RECRUITING,,2022-09-15,2026-12-31,2026-05-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,136,ESTIMATED

NCT04670094,Comorbidities and Risk Score in COVID-19 Patients,Comorbidities and Risk Score for Severity and Outcome in Patients With Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,Retrospective multi-center cohort study. Consecutive patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) up to October 2020 will be included. Patients are followed until discharge from hospital or death.,"Background

A virus causing clusters of severe pneumonia was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

This pathogen was designated as SARS-CoV-2. Although of probable zoonotic origin, human-to-human transmission has rapidly fuelled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally.

On February 20th, the first case of locally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in Northern Italy in a critically ill, hospitalized young man with no travel history to known areas of viral circulation or link to a probable or confirmed coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) case. Prior to this date, only three cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Central Italy, all with a travel history to Wuhan. Following this unexpected finding, case counts, and death tolls has increased rapidly in the country with a total of 192,994 confirmed cases and 25,969 deaths as of 24 April 2020.

Study rationale

Multiple variables have been described as possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, severity and prognosis, among which age, sex and comorbidities play an important role.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed the underlying medical conditions that have shown to increase the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2. While some comorbidities, such as serious heart conditions and chronic kidney disease have a consistent and strong evidence as bad prognostic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection, others as HIV have a limited evidence and heterogeneous results.

Further, despite it is well-known that the burden of co-existing diseases may be additive or even multiplicative, the effect of specific disease cluster on COVID-19 adverse outcomes has never been evaluated. Finally, the proposed models and risk scores currently available to predict disease severity and mortality are poorly reported and at high risk of bias, raising concern that their predictions could be unreliable when applied in daily practice. A reliable risk/prognostic score developed by a multidimensional and cross-validated approach will pave the way for future research on frail sectors of the population and on the use of health system resources. At the clinical level, a prognostic score will allow to predict severity and mortality risk in patients requiring hospitalization and to stratify patients according to clinical severity helping clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will confirm risk predictors already known and provide evidence for the uncertain ones. The investigators will also develop a prognostic score able to predict negative clinical outcomes (primarily short-term mortality), that will be useful to stratify patients at hospital admission according to their different risk profiles, and therefore to ""tailor"" the individuals' level of care.

A secondary objective could be that to extend this approach at the susceptible population level, especially the elders, to stratify according to the higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized and to have a dismal outcome (not developed here but related to a possible amendment).

Sample size

The investigators expect the total number of patients with complete data to be approximately 2500, based on the expected recruitment of each center.

Analysis Plan

Data will be summarized by counts and percentage and quartiles for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multi-state models will be used to describe patient's hospital mortality and discharge. In-hospital mortality will be estimate accounting for discharge as competing event. Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate mortality up to 3-months from admission. The role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome will be evaluated by the Cox model adjusting for relevant confounders. A clinically-based prognostic score will be developed including comorbidities and other risk factors. The score will be constructed by a multidimensional approach and Lasso approach will be used to select relevant risk factors. The Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) and Brier score will be used to evaluate model performance and the final score will be cross-validated. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a training and test validation approach. The use of regression trees for a practical definition of risk subgroups and latent variable models will also be considered.

Multiple imputation will be performed if missing would exceed 10%.

Data collection

Consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 up to October 2020 will be included. Given the difficulty in systematically obtaining written informed consent and given the great public interest of the project, the research will be conducted in the context of the authorizations guaranteed by Article 89 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU Regulation 2016/679, which guarantees processing for purposes of public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes of health data.",COMPLETED,,2020-12-30,2021-05-29,2021-05-29,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,4555,ACTUAL

The central hypothesis is that this community-informed prehab intervention will demonstrate feasibility, patient acceptability, and modulation of host and tumor-microenvironment inflammatory biomarkers.

Aim 1: Implement the prehab translational clinical trial for AI patients with obesity-related solid tumor cancer scheduled for surgery.

Aim 2 Measure host and tumor-microenvironment (TME) biomarkers using paired serum and tissue samples to compare baseline and post-intervention levels of expression. Serum markers include CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, IGF-1, VEGF, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and prealbumin. Tissue markers include Ki67, insulin receptor, TNFa, NFKB, NOS2, and cleaved caspase 3.

Aim 3: (optional exploratory aim): Assess differential expression of inflammatory genes in the TME using tumor tissue samples to compare baseline and post-intervention levels of expression. This will be done with a panel that analyzes inflammatory genes only.","The research entails a single-arm, pre-post, window-of-opportunity prehab intervention trial.

The prehab intervention is designed to modify inﬂammatory biomarkers in paired pre/post-intervention blood and tissue samples.

For the pilot intervention, 30 individuals who are 18-80 years old with a diagnosis of obesity-related solid tumor cancer, scheduled at least 3 weeks out from cancer surgery who receive care at SCAHC will be recruited over the duration of the study. Participants meeting criteria will be screened for eligibility. Those meeting eligibility criteria who are interested will be consented and enrolled. They will undergo baseline measurements that include medical/ family/cancer history and demographics, baseline anthropometric measures (blood pressure, weight, height, and waist circumference), completion of diet/exercise and health behavior questionnaires, 6-minute walk test, sit-to- stand test and blood samples which will be run for inﬂammatory biomarkers. The consent will include permission to obtain the diagnostic biopsy tissue for the purposes of this research study to measure tissue biomarkers.

After baseline evaluation, patients will receive diet and exercise counseling prior to commencing the prehab program. They will receive general nutritional guidance on healthy eating, walking, and instructed on the methods of self-monitoring their activity levels (pedometer, daily log, checklists). They will participate in twice weekly 60-minute training sessions supervised by certiﬁed fitness trainers and perform 30 minutes of walking daily on their own.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 155 patients (82 males, 73 females) who underwent robotic surgery for rectal cancer. Demographic, pre-operative, operative, and post-operative data were collected and analyzed.

Pre-operative study:

All patients underwent a standardized pre-operative work-up, which included a physical examination, comprehensive colonoscopy with biopsy, rigid rectoscopy, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen, and measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Tumor staging followed the TNM staging criteria (American Joint Committee on Cancer), with the T and N stages determined by the most advanced findings from any imaging modality

Data collected:

Retrospective evaluation and comparison of demographic characteristics, pre-operative TNM stage, distance from anal verge, tumor size, tumor grade, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and body mass index (BMI) were conducted among both patient groups. Peri-operative and post-operative data, including morbidity and mortality, were assessed, alongside parameters such as distal resection margin (DRM), proximal resection margin (PRM), harvested lymph nodes (HLN), and Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) scores. Diagnosis of anastomotic leakage was confirmed by clinical suspicion (e.g., changes in drainage, fever, abdominal pain) and further validated through contrast enema observed during follow-up computed tomography (CT). Hospital stay and readmission rates were monitored for up to 90 days post-surgery.

Post-operative follow-up:

Post-operative outcomes encompassed operative duration, estimated blood loss, time to first flatus passage, duration of liquid diet, and length of hospital stay following surgery. Operative duration comprised the time from initial skin incision to closure, including the time needed for robotic surgery docking and undocking. Upon experiencing initial flatulence, patients transitioned to a liquid diet. Hospital stay duration was measured from the time of surgery to discharge. The overall cost of surgery, including surgical procedures, anesthesia, medications, and post-operative care, was considered in the total expenditure analysis.",,COMPLETED,,2021-07-15,2024-04-15,2024-03-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,155,ACTUAL

Gene transfer involves drawing blood from the patient, and then separating out the T-cells using a machine. Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells' DNA, and then inject the changed T-cells into the body of the patient.

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an investigational type of gene transfer can be given reliably and safely in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoma. B cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection and disease. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, including B cells.

The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells (white blood cells that fight infection and disease), changing the T cells' DNA (genetic material) in a specific way, and returning the changed T cells back to the body.

Researchers want to learn the highest dose of the changed T cells that can be given safely. Researchers also want to learn how long the changed T cells remain in the participant's body, and if the changed T cells can reliably treat B-cell lymphoma. Finally, researchers want to learn if interleukin-2 (IL-2) can help the changed T cells last longer in the body.","Study Plan:

This study has 3 steps: chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, and gene transfer. If the disease relapses (returns) during the study, you may receive the T-cell infusion without having a stem cell transplant. Your study doctor will decide if you will receive the stem cell transplant or not.

The chemotherapy combination in this study (carmustine \[BiCNU®\], cytarabine \[Cytosar-U®\], etoposide \[Vepesid®\], and melphalan \[Alkeran®\] is given to try to destroy any remaining tumor cells and prepare the body for the stem cell transplant and/or T-cell infusion.

If you receive the T cells without transplant, you may receive additional chemotherapy before the T cell infusion, if your doctor thinks it is needed. Your treating doctor will discuss these chemotherapy drugs with you, and you may sign an additional consent for those chemotherapy drugs as standard of care.

A stem cell transplant is designed to help the body attack the cancer cells that may remain after chemotherapy.

The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells, changing the cells' DNA in the laboratory, and returning the genetically changed cells back to the body. T cells are a type of white blood cell that fight infection. The type of gene transfer being used in this study is designed to help your T cells better fight B-cell lymphoma. These genetically changed T cells are designed to fight B-cell lymphoma by targeting CD19 (a chemical ""marker"" that is found on certain B-cell lymphoma cells).

IL-2 (Proleukin®) is designed to help T cells grow. In this study, researchers want to learn if it can help the genetically changed T cells grow and last longer in the body.

Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of T cells, with or without IL-2, based on when you joined this study.

The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose of T cells. Each new group will receive a higher dose of T cells than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 4 dose combinations of T cells will be tested.

Tests Before Leukapheresis:

Before each of the 2 leukapheresis procedures (described below), the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and used for routine tests and to look for diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.
* To check your lung function, you will have breathing tests. A chest X-ray will be performed to check for infection.

Leukapheresis #1 or Standard Blood Draw (For Collecting T Cells) You will visit the Apheresis Clinic at MD Anderson to have leukapheresis performed. Leukapheresis is a procedure for removing blood from the body in order to collect specific blood cells. The remaining blood is then returned to the body.

Blood will be drawn through a needle in a vein in one arm, then passed through a machine, and then the remaining blood will be returned back to you through a needle in a vein in your other arm. The machine will remove a sample of your white blood cells. This process will take about 3 hours to complete.

Blood may also be collected through a standard blood draw. Blood (less than 7 tablespoons) containing circulating T cells will be drawn over 1-2 days using one or more needle sticks in your arm.

Your white blood cell sample will be sent to a lab at MD Anderson so the genetically modified T cell product can be made. The modified T cells will be grown in the lab.

It will take about 7 weeks to modify and grow the necessary number of genetically modified T cells. If researchers are unable to create a high enough dose of T cells for you in the lab, you will be taken off study.

Placement of Central Venous Catheter:

Before the second leukapheresis, you will receive a central venous catheter. This is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein in your upper chest, while you are under local anesthesia. The study investigator will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for it.

When possible, all drugs that need to be given by vein will be given using the catheter. You will also receive the T cell product through the catheter.

Leukapheresis #2 (For Collecting Stem Cells) only in patients receiving a stem cell transplant:

About a month after your first leukapheresis, you will return to have the procedure repeated a second time. This time, the blood cells collected will be a sample of blood-forming stem cells. The stem cells will be given back to you after your chemotherapy. If a high enough number of stem cells cannot be collected, however, you will be taken off study.

A stem cell transplant is part of this study's treatment plan, but in some cases, participants in this study will have their stem cells collected as part of another research study or for routine care.

Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant:

After your stem cells have been successfully collected, you will be admitted to the hospital to receive chemotherapy. You will stay in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks.

* On Day 1, you will receive carmustine by vein over 1 hour.
* Every 12 hours on Days 2-5, you will receive cytarabine by vein over 1 hour and etoposide by vein over 3 hours.
* On Day 6, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.
* On Day 7, the stem cells that were collected earlier will be given back to you (""transplanted"") by vein over 30-45 minutes. Day 7 is also called Day 0, since it is the day of the transplant. The days after the transplant are called Days +1, +2, and so on.

After the stem cell transplant, the study investigator will decide if you are still eligible to receive the T cell infusion (and IL-2, if you are assigned to receive it). If you have any infections or intolerable side effects, or if you are taking certain types of steroids by mouth or injection, you will be taken off study. If you do not receive the T cell infusions, you would not need to return for the follow-up described below.

If you have had prior involvement of disease in your brain/spine area, your physician may give you a different chemotherapy regimen consisting of the following:

* On Day 1, you will receive carmustine by vein over 1 hour.
* Every 12 hours on Days 2-3, you will receive thiotepa by vein over 1 hour
* On Day 7, the stem cells that were collected earlier will be given back to you (""transplanted"") by vein over 30-45 minutes. Day 7 is also called Day 0, since it is the day of the transplant. The days after the transplant are called Days +1, +2, and so on.

T Cell Infusion (Gene Transfer):

You will receive the T cell infusion sometime between Day +2 through Day +7. (The exact day will be as soon as you are eligible.) The T cell infusion will be given by vein over 15-30 minutes. The infusion may be divided into two parts at least 24 hours apart. The first part of the infusion will be a much smaller part to ensure that you have no immediate side effects. During the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.

Alternatively, your doctor may decide that it is better for you to receive the infusion on one day by vein over 15-30 minutes. During the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.

Before the T cell infusion, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to the T cells. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) will be given by mouth, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) will be given by vein over a few minutes.

IL-2 Administration:

If you are in Group 2 or 4, IL-2 will be injected under the skin, once a day for up to 14 days. The first dose will be on the day of your T cell infusion.

Before each IL-2 injection, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to the IL-2. Acetaminophen will be given by mouth. Diphenhydramine will be given by mouth or by vein over a few minutes.

Study Tests:

Every day while you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

On the day of the T-cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.
* You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.
* Your medical history will be recorded.
* Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

Within 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the T cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.
* Your medical history will be recorded.

At 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months (+/-5 days), blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for research to look for the modified T cells and to measure the number of B cells and other (non-modified) T cells. Like T cells, B cells are part of your immune system.

Follow-Up:

At about 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after the stem cell transplant, you will return for follow-up visits. At each visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.
* Your medical history will be recorded.
* Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for research to look for the modified T cells and to measure the number of B cells and other T cells. Part of the blood sample at 12 months will be tested for HAMA.
* Other tests to check your health may also be performed if needed, such as CT scans, PET/CT scans, and/or bone marrow aspirations and biopsies.

If the disease comes back or a side effect occurs during the 12 months after the stem cell transplant, you may be asked to return for additional follow-up visits as needed.

Length of Study Participation:

If you have any infections or intolerable side effects, you will be taken off study early.

If you complete the study as planned, you will be off-study after your last follow-up visit.

Request for Autopsy:

In the event of death due to any cause, an autopsy will be requested from your family if it is possible.

Long-Term Follow-Up:

For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires patients receiving gene transfer to have long-term follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for long-term follow up. That study is known as Protocol 2006-0676, and the follow-up will begin 1 year after the gene transfer study.

This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy and stem cell transplant in this study are commercially available and FDA approved. The gene transfer is not commercially available or FDA approved. At this time, gene transfer is only being used in research.

Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",COMPLETED,,2011-06-20,2020-04-23,2020-04-23,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,34,ACTUAL
NCT04385160,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) and COVID-19,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) and COVID-19,"An increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolism was noted in reports from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in China and has been confirmed in autopsy findings from patients who experienced sudden death. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), which encompass polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, are thrombophilic disorders with a natural propensity to thrombosis that is fuelled by the intrinsic activation of inflammatory cytokines. It therefore follows that an underlying diagnosis of MPN may increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes and death during periods of active Covid-19 disease. This ambispective, observational study aims to elucidate the key factors which affect the clinical course of patients with MPN who develop Covid-19 disease.","This is an European multicenter observational study that will include around 550 MPN patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 will be followed for at least one month. Detailed information on the clinical characteristics of these patients and their disease outcomes will be retrospectively and prospectively collected in a specific eCRF, including MPN characteristics, treatment and comorbidities pre-Covid-19, time of Covid-19 diagnosis, drugs/device used for the treatment of Covid-19, any change in MPN therapy, antithrombotic prophylaxis employed during the period of infection and - for hospitalised patients only - key blood and laboratory parameters. A particular focus will be on exploring final outcomes for patients in this study, most notably the incidence of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events. Statistical analyses will also be performed looking for any independent factors that can significantly predict patient outcomes after Covid-19 diagnosis.

Ultimately, this project will provide important insights into disease severity and progression in patients with MPN and Covid-19 and uncover the key clinical factors which drive outcomes and mortality. Results may help clinicians better understand how patient characteristics and management decisions can impact on disease trajectory when MPN and Covid-19 collide.",UNKNOWN,,2020-05-13,2022-08-31,2022-02-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,552,ESTIMATED

Women who exercise regularly and who have lower levels of blood sugar and metabolic hormones like insulin have a lower risk of developing breast cancer. Some evidence also suggests that exercise and metabolism are related to cancer recurrence in women who are diagnosed with breast cancers that can be removed with surgery, but less is known about how exercise and metabolic factors are related to cancer progression in women whose cancer has advanced beyond the breast and underarm lymph nodes. This study is designed to look at the effects of exercise combined with prolonged nightly fasting (having a longer time between dinner and breakfast the next day), on blood sugar and hormones that control metabolism. This study looks to provide important information about whether making these kinds of changes is possible for women living with advanced breast cancer and will explore how making these changes effects blood sugar and hormone levels in women taking different kinds of treatments for advanced breast cancer.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, a baseline visit to collect information about diet and exercise habits, a baseline blood draw, participation in a 12-week diet and exercise program, and a follow up visit and blood collection at the end of the diet and exercise program.

Participants will be in this research study for up to 14-weeks, including the baseline and end of study visits to collect study measures.

Eligible subjects with NMIBC will be recruited to the trial following the initial diagnostic cystoscopy. During the diagnostic cystoscopy, the number of tumor lesions, their size and location will be documented and recorded with video or photo cystoscopy.

A baseline cystoscopy will be conducted in all subjects for the evaluation of number of tumors and their diameters, and for mapping of their location. Baseline blood samples for liver and renal functions, as well as for complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation tests will be drawn prior to instillation to ensure eligibility and to serve as a reference point for systemic safety follow-up.

A future TURBT has been planned for 8-10 weeks post screening. Enrolled subjects will be treated successively with 40mg MMC in 40 mL TC-3 (the first 6 subjects) and with 80 mg MMC in 40 mL TC-3 (the following 12 subjects). At treatment session initiation, an 18-20 Fr two-way catheter will be inserted into the subject's bladder in order to completely empty the bladder of urine. Thereafter, a volume of 40 mL of cooled TC-3 mixed with 40 mg or 80 mg of MMC will be instilled through the catheter into the bladder of the subject. The catheter will then be ligated for twenty minutes, after which it will be drawn out of the bladder and the subject was will be allowed to urinate freely.

The subjects will undergo six weekly bladder instillations according to their assigned treatment of either 40 mg MMC (Group A) or 80 mg MMC (Group B) in 40 mL of TC-3. Following completion of instillation treatment series, there will be a 2-4 weeks healing period prior to next follow up visit (overall 10-12 weeks post screening). During 2-4 weeks follow-up (FU) visit, the lesions' status will be examined under cystoscopy. For subjects who will appear to have complete response (CR), this will be confirmed based on histological results. For subjects that will not be classified as having CR, decision about performance of TURBT or giving additional treatment will be at the PI's discretion.

Following 2-4 week FU visit, subjects will be managed according to their local standard guidelines. All patients will attempt to be followed up for 12 months following 2-4 weeks FU within the trial. These visits will be documented and data regarding recurrence and progression will be collected.

Background

1. Petersen's hernia after gastrectomy Petersen's hernia was reported in 1900 by German surgeon Walther Petersen following the occurrence of an internal hernia after gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy (G-J) 1\[\]. Petersen's hernia occurs in the free space posterior to a G-J site after any type of G-J and is caused by herniation of the small bowel through the defect between the small bowel mesentery and the transverse mesocolon.

   As shown in CT figure in Figure 1, the small bowel mesentery rotates and twists, leading to an emergency situation in which necrosis of the entire small intestine occurs due to decreased blood circulation of the small intestine The occurrence rate of Petersen's hernias after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y G-J is approximately 1.7\~9.7%

   - Peterson's hernia can occur in the RNY esophagojejunal anastomosis after gastrectomy, or after the RNY gastrojejunostomy and Billroth type 2 anastomosis after distal gastrectomy. Also, it can occur after the obesity surgery RNY gastric bypass surgery.
2. The incidence of internal hernia has been reported to be higher in laparoscopic approaches than in open gastrectomy One possible cause of the increasing incidence of Petersen's hernias is the recent development of minimally invasive surgery. A higher incidence of internal hernia is reported in minimally invasive gastrectomy than in open gastrectomy.

   After open surgery, adhesion was made between the small bowel and the operative wound site, however with minimally invasive surgery, adhesion is remarkably decreased, not only because of the disappearance of the open wound in the upper abdomen but also the use of antiadhesive agent Therefore, non-absorbable sutures require the closure of Peterson's spaces, and according to report of Blockhuys M, the frequency of internal hernia decreased after closure of Petersen's space.

   The frequency of internal hernia significantly decreases when Peterson space closure is implemented compared to the group that performed mesentery defect closure only.
3. The problem of Petersen's space closure procedure The closure of the defect at Petersen's space can induce bleeding by injuring the mesenteric vessels, as well as small bowel ischemia, caused by injuring the peripheral mesenteric vessels near the small bowel lumen. It has also been reported that early postoperative obstruction could be due to jejunal kinking of the closing site of the mesenteric defect. The closure of mesenteric defects increased the risk for severe postoperative complications in the early postoperative phase (\<30 days) following the closure, mainly because of kinking of the jejunostomy site. We also encountered kinking of the jejunojejunostomy in the early postoperative periods after gastrectomy. However, it is not easy to determine if the complications are because of kinking of the entero-entero anastomosis or the adhesion effect from the closure of Petersen's space. Peterson space closure is necessary, but it is difficult by technical problem to develop an easy method.
4. Previous study We conducted jejunal mesentery fixing (Mefix) to the transverse mesocolon with a non-absorbable suture to prevent of a Petersen's hernia.

The theory of the Mefix method is as follows. When the mesentery of the small intestine is fixed to the transverse mesocolon between the small bowel and the colon mesentery, the defect still remains. However, the small bowel does not enter the defect because the small bowel mesentery is fixed at the transverse mesocolon; consequently, a Petersen's hernia does not occur.

MEFIX method allowed partial herniation of bowel, but it prevent of total herniation. This prevent bowel infarction

We closed Petersen's space defect between March 1st, 2016 and Dec 31th, 2017 (N=49), and we performed the Mefix procedure between July 1st, 2017 and June 30th, 2018 (N=26). We classified patients into the Petersen's space closure group (closure group) and the mesentery fixing group (Mefix group). All patients visited the hospital at six months and one year after surgery, and a CT scan was performed to check for the recurrence of gastric cancer. We determined the incidence of Petersen's hernia by abdominal CT scan, and we found no incidence of Petersen's hernias in either group. The procedure times for mesentery fixing (3.7 ± 1.1 minutes) were significantly shorter than those for Petersen's space closures (7.5 ± 1.5 minutes) (p\<0.001). However, a retrospective study and a small group of patients seem to require a large, prospective random study.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2022-04-01,2029-01-26,2027-01-26,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,444,ESTIMATED

NCT01432860,A Comparison of Interventions to Teach Melanoma Patients Skin Self-examination,A Comparison of Interventions to Teach Melanoma Patients Skin Self-examination,"The almost 724,000 Americans survivors of melanoma are estimated to have 4 first degree relatives per case; thus, 2.8 million Americans are at increased risk of developing melanoma in comparison to the general public. Skin self-examination (SSE) with the assistance of a partner by these individuals could improve survival. If effective, the workbook tested in this proposal could be distributed to people at risk of developing melanoma by large scale means in physicians office.","Population based registries document that survival from melanoma, a growing public health problem with approximately 70,000 new melanoma cases and an estimated 8,600 deaths in 2010, is dependent on the thickness of the melanoma. By facilitating seeking medical care, skin self-examinations (SSEs) by individuals with a prior history of melanoma, who are at risk to develop subsequent melanomas, may lead to the early detection and treatment of melanoma when it is usually more effective. Thus, further research that enhances early detection is warranted and our application directly tests novel methods of training high-risk melanoma patients and their partners on how to conduct SSEs to promote early detection. Our proposed research builds upon the strengths of the R21 that: a) established that in-person training to conduct SSE with a partner significantly enhanced SSE performance 4 months after the intervention, and b) developed and pilot tested a manualized take-home workbook training approach (WORKBOOK). Our pilot work on the WORKBOOK with partners suggests that patient-partner dyads (n = 21) perceived it to be readable, useful, and in the short term 4 month follow-up, empirically equivalent in promoting SSE knowledge, skills, and behaviors compared with patient-partner dyads in the in-person partner training condition (n = 19). Our proposed research builds on our NCI funded studies by conducting a formal examination with 430 pairs (860 subjects) randomized to either the in-person or workbook training vs. an assessment only control group that receives standard of care over a 2 year longitudinal study with 4 month interval evaluations. An additional group of 70 pairs (140 subjects) has been added to test a tablet computer-based program.

Our proposed research directly tests novel methods of training Stage I and IIB melanoma patients, who have a 5 year survival of 80-90%, and their partners, on how to conduct SSEs. We will compare the efficacy of the in-person training vs. workbook for patients and partners vs. controls on SSE knowledge/skill acquisition and retention, and SSE performance and accuracy on a short (4 and 8 months post baseline) and long term basis (12, 16, 20, and 24 months post baseline) and examine whether partner-patient relationship-qualities moderate the relationship between the training approaches and SSEs knowledge/skill acquisition and retention, and SSE performance and accuracy. The tablet computer-based program will also be tested for efficacy and compared with the previous groups.

Establishing health promotion partnerships is important to those at risk to develop melanoma because SSE is difficult to successfully perform as an individual. It is expected that the workbook will promote SSE at least as well as and perhaps better than in-person training and become an easily disseminated SSE training approach that is not dependent on the time and teaching skills of the non-MD clinical office staff.",COMPLETED,,2011-09,2015-05,2015-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,SCREENING,1000,ACTUAL

Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy in different ways and combining it with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Celecoxib may slow the growth of cervical cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus celecoxib, fluorouracil, and cisplatin in treating patients who have locally advanced cervical cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine treatment-related toxicity rates in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy concurrently with celecoxib, fluorouracil, and cisplatin.
* Determine whether this regimen increases locoregional control rates, distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival in these patients.
* Determine whether first-failure patterns in patients treated with this regimen are changed compared to historical controls.

Many people receive treatments called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies for their breast cancer, however these can affect heart function. This 'cardiotoxicity' is generally temporary and mild, but patients receive drugs to help their heart recover. Currently it is not known how long patients should receive these treatments. Patients with other types of heart failure are treated lifelong, but this may not be necessary here as the damaging cancer drugs have stopped. Taking drugs for many years can have an impact on people's quality of life, particularly for young patients. It is therefore important to understand the best treatment length. The investigators will study people whose heart function has recovered after HER2 therapy heart problems and are not at high risk for heart disease. The investigators will carefully stop their heart drugs whilst monitoring them closely with special heart scans and blood tests to detect problems early. The investigators will also study how patients are currently treated using national data. The results of this study will help doctors better guide breast cancer survivors about treatment of heart damage from HER2 cancer therapies.","Trial design: Two centre open label randomised control trial to evaluate the phased withdrawal versus continuation of heart failure treatment for 'recovered' human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy-related cardiac dysfunction in non-high risk patients following completion of HER2 therapy. The trial will include cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans (CMR) with automated in-line analytics to improve the sensitivity for detection of early relapse, and detailed patient questionnaires assessing medication disutility to better understand participant motivations and concerns related to treatment continuation and withdrawal.

Trial population: The trial will recruit 90 adult participants (\>18 years) with a prior diagnosis of HER2-targeted therapy related cardiac dysfunction, who currently receive standard heart failure/ cardioprotective medications (any combination of Angiotensin-converting enzyme \[ACE\] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers \[ARBs\] and/or beta-blockers), and whose cardiac function has 'recovered'. 'Recovery' is defined as absence of heart failure symptoms with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved to 50% or greater and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) \<200ng/L, for greater than 6 months. Patients will be recruited from Barts Health and University College London Hospitals (UCLH) cardio-oncology and breast cancer clinics. Exclusion criteria: Patients with advanced/ metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer requiring ongoing HER2 therapies or with life expectancy \<12months will be excluded. Patients classed as high/very high cardiotoxicity risk according to the European Society of Cardiology/International Cardio-Oncology Society Position Statement (Lyon et al, 2020), LVEF \<50% prior to HER2-therapies or on completion of anthracycline treatment, or indications for ongoing ACE inhibitors, ARBs and/or beta-blockers, nor those with absolute contraindications to CMR.

Interventions and Duration of treatment: Participants will undergo phased withdrawal of heart failure/ cardioprotective treatments according to a pre-specified algorithm based on the 'Withdrawal of pharmacological treatment for heart failure in patients with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy' (TRED-HF) study protocol (Halliday et al 2019). This had been designed following extensive consultation with independent experts and attempts to mimic 'real-world' medication withdrawal in clinical practice.

NCT02930876,Feasibility of Home vs. Hospital Based Resistance Training for Advanced Cancer Patients,Feasibility of Home vs. Hospital Based Resistance Training for Advanced Cancer Patients: a Phase II Trial,"Cancer causes 8.2 million deaths each year, with an estimated worldwide cost of $895 billion. Pharmacological treatments provide improvements in expected survival and symptoms, but at cost of a high rate of toxicities and increased time spent by patients away from their homes and families during treatment. This is particularly important for patients with advanced disease as the timeframe at stake relates to their last months of life.

Sarcopenia (i.e. loss of muscle mass together with decreased functional capacity) has been widely reported as an important prognostic factor in advanced cancer, with impact on survival, toxicities, response to treatment and other patient-centered outcomes (such as functional capacity, quality of life and fatigue).

Sarcopenia is a term first used in 1988 by Rosenberg, meaning an age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass and function. It was derived from the greek: sarx = flesh and penia = loss. In 2010, a European Consensus defined sarcopenia as a triad of muscle mass loss, decreased functional performance and muscle strength. It has been reported as a hallmark of cancer, with impact on prognosis, response to treatments, side effects of chemotherapy and recovery after surgery. The prevalence of sarcopenia in advanced cancer seems to vary according to gender, stage, primary tumor location and treatments, being present in about 28 to 67% of patients.

Exercise, in particular resistance training, is one of the most powerful ways of increasing muscle mass and evidence from elderly patients suggests that it is among the most promising interventions for sarcopenia. There is evidence that resistance training can be effective but evidence is still scarce for patients with advanced disease. Historically there have been some concerns regarding safety and efficacy for oncologic patients, and though evidence suggests that resistance training is one of the most preferred forms of exercise by patients, the effectiveness of resistance training alone on sarcopenia in patients with advanced cancer remains unknown.

NCT05289076,Evaluation of Tumour Growth and Oncological Treatment in Patients With CRLM Using Zebra Fish Embryo Model,Protocol for Evaluation of Oncological Treatment in Patients With CRLM Using Zebra Fish Avatars-may This Model Improve Resection Rates and Survival in Patients With Upfront Non-resectable Metastatic Disease?,"In order to improve and individualize cancer treatment, personalized treatment needs to be developed much further. Liver metastasizing colorectal cancer is treated with a combination of oncological and surgical interventions. The selection of chemotherapy is today mainly done according to best guess. Today only a small fraction of oncological treatment may be known to be effective in a person before treatment start, most often it is trial and error. A fast reliable system for looking at response to different treatments in each unique patient is much needed and would, if successful, completely change the way we give oncological treatment today. Patient's tumor tissue will be evaluated with use of zebrafish embryo avatars to evaluate tumour growth and response to different combinations of chemotherapy. If successful interventional studies are planned.","The possibilities to predict oncological tumor response for individual patients with GI malignancies in order to tailor a personalized oncological treatment, are currently limited. This means that most of the information used to decide upon oncological treatment pertains to a group of patients rather than individuals. Similarly, most of the chemotherapy regimens used is not individually tailored although it has been shown to be beneficial for certain cohorts of patients. In colorectal cancer, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma) and BRAF mutation status predict the response to drugs targeting various steps in the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF signaling pathway, whereas MSI/MMR status may predict the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitors \[1\]. As chemotherapy, as well as other cancer treatments, may have severe side effects the treatment may not only be ineffective but may also cause severe adverse events even shortening the patient's life and inhibit the chance of curative tumor resection. For this reason, pre-treatment response evaluation in an avatar model of zebrafish, would be most valuable.

From a clinical point of view the easiest situation is in the adjuvant setting. At this point the whole tumor is available for analysis and larger pieces of tissues may be used in the avatar model. 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine (a 5-FU prodrug) either alone or in combination with oxaliplatin is the current standard adjuvant treatment in stage III colon cancer and stage II colon cancers with 2+ risk factors. Other types of combination regimens including e.g. irinotecan have so far failed to show benefit in the adjuvant situation.

In the neoadjuvant setting, i.e. preoperative treatment to patients with resectable CRLM, combinations of 5-FU (or capecitabine) and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan may improve the outcome of surgery and long term prognosis. It is currently not known which regimen is most efficient for the individual patient.

In the most severe scenario, where the patient presents with unresectable CRLM, either palliative chemotherapy or downsizing/conversion chemotherapy is indicated. For the latter group of patients, it is of uttermost importance to provide as potent treatment as possible in the first line, as the 10

The therapeutic window is narrow and further clinical and/or radiological progression on the first line therapy may preclude further oncological and surgical interventions. Fit patients may benefit from a triplet of 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI). However, this is a toxic regimen, and older or less fit patients are more commonly offered a doublet of 5-FU and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan. There may be an additional value when the chemotherapy is combined with antibodies targeting VEGF or, for those tumors expressing wild type KRAS, the EGF receptor.

But maybe the most valuable setting for the patient with upfront non-resectable tumor burden, would be before any treatment has started.

Up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases either synchronous or metachronous in relation to the detection of the primary tumor\[2\]. The mainstay of treatment today is a combination of resection +/-ablation of metastases, with or without preoperative liver volume augmentation and chemotherapy sometimes in combination with antibodies\[3\].

A number of negative prognostic factors have been identified both regarding the tumor growth but also in the pattern of oncogens in the tumors\[4\]. Still, one of the most important factors is the response of the metastases to chemotherapy both radiologically but also in reduction of tumor markers (CEA, CA19/9)\[5, 6\].

Still we have very little knowledge if the metastases are going to respond to the therapy given or not. Tumor with KRAS mutation will not respond to Erbitux treatment, and mucinous tumors are usually more resistant to any chemotherapy\[7\].

Different models have been explored to evaluate tumor specific response to treatment, but most are slow or have shown mixed results\[8\]. Today, mouse patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model is the most used and validated to predict response to therapy, but evaluation of oncological therapy takes months \[9\]. Therefore, the mouse PDX model cannot be used for clinical decision-making. Organoid cultures using patient-derived cancers is a well-used in vitro screening tool, with promising results for different tumors\[10\]. Organoids maintain the genetic characteristics of the original tumor tissue. Still, these models are slow when it comes to evaluating patients' tissue for treatment decisions and lacks the ability to evaluate metastatic or angiogenic potentials.

Recently zebrafish embryos have been used as avatars for human cancer, first in hematogenous cancers but lately also in solid cancers like PDAC, breast cancer and colorectal cancer\[11-14\].

The model has several advantages, the strongest is response evaluation only 3-5 days after the tumor tissue is implanted in the embryos. The embryos are transparent so tumor growth and spread can be visualized in detail and quantified in a semi-automatic manner\[15\]. As the zebra fish embryos own immune system does not respond until day 8 days \[14\], why the immune response against the tumor comes from the patient's own immune cells, this is also the reason why xenograft engraftment works in this model. On the other hand. So far, biopsy tissue is not enough, but at least a cubic centimetre of tumor tissue is needed to generate these avatars. For this reason, needle biopsies are not providing enough material but resected liver tumor tissues are needed in the current protocols.

In zebrafish embryos, colorectal cancer cells have been shown to grow and response evaluation of different chemotherapy combinations have been successful with very good correlation to the response in humans\[14\]. Clinical studies on colorectal liver metastases have so far not been performed.

Fish are housed at an average temperature of 28 °C in a recirculating system with a 14:10 h light to dark cycle. Zebrafish fertilized eggs are obtained by natural mating of wild-type AB strain at our facilities and the developing embryos are staged in incubator at 28 °C according to Kimmel et al\[19\]. Before any procedure, embryos will be anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine. The tumor tissue taken from the surgical specimen by the histopathologist is cryopreserved by submerging the tissue in cryotubes containing cryopreservation medium, adding the tubes to a cryobox and placing the box in a -80 degrees freezer for at least 24 hours. The tube with tissue is then transported on dry ice to the zebrafish laboratory where the tissue will be thawed, washed and incubated in a protease mix within a mechanical disaggregation device (GentleMACS), to produce a single cell suspension from the tissue. The suspension is filtered and incubated for 30 min in 40 μg/mL CM-Dil in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by centrifugation, and washing with PBS. The labeled cells are then resuspended in implantation medium and injected using thin glass capillary needles into the subcutaneous perivitelline compartment of 2-days old zebrafish embryos. Successfully implanted zebrafish embryos are then transferred to embryo medium containing the drugs under investigation (e.g. the drugs that could be considered for treatment of the patient donating the sample) and treated for three days. Images of the tumors are acquired both immediately after transplantation and following the three-day treatment period, and an additional image of the main metastatic site in the zebrafish embryo is acquired after the three-day treatment period to evaluate the metastatic capabilities of the cells. Treatment outcome will be evaluated as change in tumor volume between day 3 and day 0 in the treatment group compared to the vehicle control group (percent), and a significantly stronger reduction of tumor volumes in the treatment group will be considered as a positive treatment outcome. Evidence of a pro-metastatic phenotype will be derived from the number of cells found at the metastatic site in the zebrafish embryos three days after implantation. Cut-off levels for how many metastasized cells are required to predict likely metastatic progression in the patient will be evaluated in the first 10-20 patients included as such information is not currently available from other sources of information.",RECRUITING,,2022-05-17,2025-03-14,2024-03-14,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,40,ESTIMATED

Tertiary objectives:

Evaluation of the influence of this approach on the up-staging of the patients

Microscopic study of the ICG distribution in the lymph nodes (in the lymphatic sinuses, in specific cells, in cancerous foci...)

Methodology:

In the operating room:

Patients will undergo standard surgical resection. Immediately after removal of the colon and node-bearing mesentery, using different 29 Gauge insulin syringes, blue dye (2 ml blue dye: 0.5 ml per injection) and ICG (2 ml with 0,5 mg ICG per ml: 0.5 ml per injection) will be injected in the fresh specimen beside each other submucosally around the tumour in at least four sites (as many injections needed to cover all the perimeter of the tumour) for each agent. The injection sites will be then gently stretched and massaged for 3-5 min to stimulate the tracers to flow along the lymphatic channels. Fluoroscopic imagings of the mesentery will be performed during the injections and during these manoeuvers.

The research and identification of the sentinel lymph nodes will be then performed as follows:

1. he will first localize the blue colored lymph vessels (if visible) as well as the palpable and/or blue colored lymph nodes. These last ones will be marked for dissection with a blue suture.
2. using the PDE camera, he will thereafter localize the fluorescent lymph vessels (if visible) as well as the palpable and/or fluorescent lymph nodes. These last ones will be marked for dissection with a green suture.

Histopathology in the Laboratory of Pathology:

When all SLN are identified, they will be dissected and classified as follows:

* SLN first seen as blue and confirmed also as fluorescent using PDE
* SLN seen as blue but not confirmed to be fluorescent using PDE
* SLN not directly visible as blue but seen fluorescent using PDE (the LN in this group will be controlled for their blue or not character when dissected)
* LN identified by the pathologist as pathological but not blue and not fluorescent.

After the dissection of these SLN, the specimen will be processed as usual using routine procedure for further examination of the non SLN by the pathologists. Once these lymph nodes are dissected, they will be tested for the emitted fluorescence.",COMPLETED,,2013-01,2015-02,2013-02,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,20,ACTUAL

Twelve evaluable participants with advanced solid tumors will be assessed. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APN401 and to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of APN401. The secondary objective is to collect preliminary data on the clinical efficacy of APN401.

Participants will receive up to four APN401 treatments via intravenous infusion at 3-weekly intervals. Participants, who have completed four treatment cycles and a safety follow-up, will be contacted by telephone to evaluate survival status at 6 and 12 months after start of treatment.","APN401 is a suspension of autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), transiently transfected with an siRNA to reduce Cbl-b protein levels. The administration of autologous Cbl-b silenced PBMCs to the patient will promote activation of both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms targeting tumor cells; along these lines APN401 is assumed to demonstrate significant improvement in cancer immune therapy. In addition, silencing of Cbl-b in the context of cellular therapeutics has potential to reduce mortality rates for patients with advanced cancers.

This is an open-label, single-arm trial to be conducted with up to twelve patients at four hospitals in Austria, Europe. Two dose levels of APN401 are evaluated using a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) study design with accelerated titration:

* Dose Level/Cohort 1: 1.5x10\^7 PBMCs/kg
* Dose Level/Cohort 2: 4.5x10\^7 PBMCs/kg

Dose escalation requires at least one patient to be treated and observed for at least three weeks after the first dose. The BOIN method will be used to guide the dose level assignment and estimate the MTD/RP2D based on cumulative information on DLTs in Cycle 1 of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks after first dose).

Patients with advanced solid tumors first undergo screening procedures during a 28-day time window between giving consent and starting APN401 treatment.

Endometrial cancer (EC) of the uterus is becoming more common in the US. Sometimes EC often has increased levels of a protein called HER2. Cancers with HER2 tend to be more aggressive and have poorer outcomes.

Objective:

To test 2 study drugs-a vaccine that targets HER2 (AdHER2DC) plus a drug that supercharges immune cells that kill tumor cells (N-803)-combined with 2 FDA-approved cancer treatment drugs in people with EC.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 and older with HER2-positive EC that returned or got worse after treatment.

Design:

AdHER2DC vaccine is made from each participant s own blood. Participants will undergo apheresis: Blood is removed from the body through a tube attached to a needle. The blood passes through a machine that separates out the target cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body through a second needle. A special catheter may be needed.

The first treatment cycle is 28 days; each cycle after that will be 21 days.

All participants will get the 2 approved drugs and the vaccine. One drug is a tablet taken by mouth once a day, every day. The other drug is given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein.

The vaccine is injected under the skin. Participants will receive the vaccine on day 1 of cycles 1, 2, and 3. Additional doses up to 3 doses will be give if possible.

Some participants will receive N-803. This drug is injected under the skin of the abdomen on day 1 of each cycle.

Treatment may last up to 1 year. Follow-up visits will continue up to 2 more years.","BACKGROUND:

* Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic cancer in the US and the incidence peaks around 50-60 years of age. 5-year overall survival in patients with metastasis is around 20 percent and treatment after the second-line treatment has not been effective for long-term control.
* Pembrolizumab is approved for microsatellite instability (MSI)-high endometrial cancer which is rare.
* Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic EC showed promising antitumor activity. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with advanced endometrial cancer who received prior chemotherapy after decades of lapse in adding new treatment options with an improved progression free survival (PFS) 6.6 months (vs 3.8 months in standard care chemotherapy), overall response rate 30 percent and median duration of response of 9.2 months.
* HER2 is positive in 30 percent of endometrial cancer and anti-HER2 therapy has shown clinical benefit in metastatic EC. Trastuzumab is used off-label with chemotherapy and as maintenance.
* An autologous dendritic cell vaccine that is transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of HER2 (AdHER2DC vaccine) was well tolerated and showed a preliminary clinical benefit of 33.3 percent among 21 evaluable patients (NCT01730118, total enrolled n=33). No cardiotoxicity was noted. Immunogenicity analysis in a limited number of patients suggested induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses.
* The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in EC showed antitumor activity with manageable toxicity but still showed the responses in a limited group of patients. To overcome the resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, the combination regimen to induce the antitumor immune response by the AdHER2 vaccine, control the negative immune regulators and hostile tumor microenvironment by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor lenvatinib, and an immune stimulatory cytokine IL-15 superagonist N-803 has the potential to make the tumor more responsive to the immunotherapy creating mutual synergy.

OBJECTIVES:

* Phase I: To estimate recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, N-803, and AdHER2DC vaccine in participants with HER2 positive endometrial cancer
* Phase II: To preliminarily assess the efficacy of a combination of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, N-803, and AdHER2DC vaccine in participants with HER2 positive endometrial cancer as determined by the proportion of participants without progression at 6 months

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

* Age \>=18 years.
* Metastatic or locally advanced endometrial cancer with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+, 2+ or 3+.
* Progressed after at least 1 line of standard of care (SOC) systemic therapy Participants may have received any number of prior cytotoxic agents.
* ECOG performance status \<=2 and adequate organ function.

DESIGN:

* An open-label, two-arm, phase I/II study of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, N-803, and AdHER2.
* During Phase I, we will estimate recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the lenvatinib in combination with AdHER2DC vaccine, pembrolizumab, and N-803.
* During Phase II we will continue to evaluate the safety and examine the efficacy of the study regimen at the RP2D of the lenvatinib in combination with AdHER2 DC vaccine, pembrolizumab, and N-803.
* Participants will undergo apheresis, and AdHER2DC vaccine will be generated by transducing the participants monocyte-derived dendritic cells with AdHER2 vector.
* Treatment will be delivered for up to 1 year or until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Up to 27 participants will be treated on this trial.",RECRUITING,,2024-05-14,2028-12-31,2026-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,NON_RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,NONE,TREATMENT,60,ESTIMATED

Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of primary and malignant tumor of the brain. Currently, the standard of care for this disease includes surgical resection, followed by radiation with chemotherapy and tumor treating fields. Despite this aggressive therapy, the survival after finishing treatment remains low and the disease often reoccurs. Unfortunately, the available therapy options for recurrent glioblastoma are minimal and do not have a great effect on survival. AMSCs are found in body fat and when separated from the fat, are delivered into the surgical cavity at the time of surgery. When in direct contact with tumor cells, AMSCs affect tumor growth, residual tumor cell death, and chemotherapy resistance. The use of AMSCs delivered locally into the surgical cavity of recurrent glioblastoma during a craniotomy could improve the long-term outcomes of these patients by decreasing the progression rate and invasiveness of malignant cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of locally delivered adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of locally delivered AMSCs in patients with recurrent GBM.

II. To assess overall survival (OS) in recurrent GBM patients treated with locally delivered AMSCs.

III. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in recurrent GBM patients treated with locally delivered AMSCs.

CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore the systemic immune response after application of AMSCs through cytokine analysis on peripheral blood samples.

II. To explore the local changes on the brain parenchyma by analyzing tissue at recurrence.

III. To explore the presence of AMSCs on brain tissue at recurrence.

Although a causal relationship is implied, the mechanism remains to be proven. These neoplasms are thought to be the direct consequence of mutational events induced by the prior therapy .

Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes / acute myeloid leukemia (t- MDS / t-AML) is now considered a single entity, called therapy-related myeloid neoplasms based on the current World Health Organization WHO classification2,. It is a well-recognized clinical syndrome occurring as a late complication following Cytotoxic agents and ionizing radiotherapy in the treatment of most cancer types: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), sarcoma, and ovarian and testicular cancer3,4.

The characteristics of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and the timing of its development after a primary diagnosis depend on the exposure to specific agents as well as the cumulative dose and dose intensity of the preceding cytotoxic therapy 5.

The incidence of t-MDS/AML following conventional therapy ranges from 0.8% to 6.3% at 20 years. The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3 to 5 years, with the risk decreasing markedly after the first decade 6.

Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized in the WHO classification depending on the causative therapeutic exposure: an alkylating agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II inhibitor-related type. Alkylating agent-related t-MDS/AML usually appears 4 to 7 years after exposure to the mutagenic agent .

Approximately two-thirds of patients present with MDS and the remainder with AML with myelodysplastic features. Patients frequently present with cytopenias. Multilineage dysplasia is often present 7.

In this classic form of therapy-related leukemia that follows treatment with alkylating agents and/or radiation therapy, the blood and bone marrow findings resemble those seen in primary MDS, although the degree of dysgranulopoiesis and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis is typically greater 8.

In contrast to alkylating agent t-MDS/AML, AML secondary to topoisomerase II inhibitors often does not have a preceding myelodysplastic phase, and presents as overt acute leukemia, often with a prominent monocytic component. The latency period between the initiation of treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and the onset of leukemia is brief, with a median of 2 to 3 years 9.

The reciprocal translocation t(8;9) (p22;p24) between the short arm of chromosome 8 and the long arm of chromosome 9 is a recurrent abnormality that fuses the Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2) to the human autoantigen pericentriolar material 1 gene (PCM1) , with breakage and reunion at bands 8p11 and 9q341010.

PCM1 encodes a large protein of 228kDa containing several potential coiled-coil domains in its aminoterminal part. This protein is localized in cytoplasmatic granules referred to as centriolar satellites. It is supposed to play a crucial role in the assembly of centrosomal proteins, microtubule organisation, and in the progression of cell cycle11.

Due to PCM1-JAK2 gene fusion, the coiled-coil domains of PCM1 mediate an oligomerization that brings together the linked JAK2 domains resulting in a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase domain of JAK212, 13.

JAK2 is a member of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2). These non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a significant role in various signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein is formed of seven domains. The JH2 domain (pseudokinase domain, kinase-like domain) is located in exon 14 and has an essential negative autoregulatory function14.

The most common mechanism for JAK2 activation in hematologic malignancies is the point mutation at position 617 (V617F).

The consequences of JAK2 activation are neoplastic transformation and abnormal cell proliferation in various malignancies15.

* So, translocations involving the JAK2 locus are considered of oncogenic importance in acute leukemias and myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases.
* Patients with this abnormality present with broad clinical spectrum ranging from chronic to acute hematological diseases with myeloid or lymphoid appearance 16.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a kind of cytogenetic technique that allows the visualization of defined nucleic acid sequences in particular cellular or chromosomal sites by hybridization of complementary fluorescently labeled probe sequences within intact metaphase or interphase cells.

The fluorescent probes are nucleic acid labeled with fluorescent groups and can bind to specific DNA/RNA sequences. Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes17.",UNKNOWN,,2019-06,2022-06,2021-06,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,140,ESTIMATED

Chessels et al reported the results in 235 pediatric patients with ALL in CR3 treated between 1972 and 1998. Only 18 of the 235 patients remained alive, with multiple early treatment failures implying significant instability of the third remission state. Factors that were found to be of significant influence on survival for these patients in CR3 were length of CR2, type of second event, immunophenotype, type of third treatment, type of first relapse, presenting leukocyte count, and length of CR1. The 3-year leukemia-free survival for patients with ALL in CR3 treated with hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) was reported as 20% in a single-institution report on patients transplanted with unrelated donors between 1987 and 1999. This report found a 20% relapse rate in ALL patients in CR3 and reported that patients transplanted after 1992 had a higher rate of relapse, implying that as improved chemotherapy regimens become more successful in curing patients, those who develop relapse may have disease more resistant to treatment. Clofarabine (\[2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-arabinofuranosyl)adenine\]; Cl-F-ara-A; CAFdA) is a rationally designed, second-generation purine nucleoside antimetabolite. Clofarabine was designed as a hybrid molecule to overcome the limitations and incorporate the best qualities of fludarabine (F-ara-A) and cladribine (2-CdA, CdA), all three molecules are currently approved by the FDA for treatment of hematologic malignancies. In an open-label Phase II, pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 by IVI over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response. Among the 49 patients evaluated for efficacy, the overall remission rate was 20%. The median duration of remission could not be calculated for the 6 patients who achieved a CR because 3 patients were still in remission at the time of data cutoff. The median duration for the 4 patients who achieved a CRp was 20 weeks (Range: 4.6 to 28.6 weeks). Eight (16%) patients went on to receive a transplant with 7 (14%) experiencing clinical benefit. In an open-label Phase II study, pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed AML received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 by IVI over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response. The overall remission rate (CR + CRp) was 3%; 23% of patients achieved a PR. The median duration of remission for patients who achieved at least a PR was 16.2 weeks. Twelve (34%) patients went on to receive a transplant, 7 of whom were still alive at the time of data cutoff with survival ranging from 16.4 weeks to 93.6 weeks.

Patients enrolling must have undergone an extensive pre-transplant evaluation to assess remission status, assure adequate organ system function, and document freedom from active viral, bacterial, and fungal infection. Patients should proceed to transplant as soon as possible following their reinduction chemotherapy. Patients with delays in therapy due to toxicity or donor procurement delays should receive maintenance chemotherapy if possible. Patients must be scheduled to begin their preparative regimen within 10 days of enrolling on the study. This will be a 2 part study. Part A will be the dose escalation phase. Once the MTD and/or safe/tolerated dose of clofarabine has been established, Part B will accrue patients to further define the event free, disease free and overall survival at the MTD or safe/tolerated dose of clofarabine. At study entry during Part A, a clofarabine dose level will be assigned to each patient. During Part B, the established MTD or safe/tolerated dose of clofarabine will be used.

In Part A this study will enroll patients with ALL and ANLL in relapse, induction failure, CR3 or CR3P and without prior AlloSCT. These patients will receive a conditioning regimen of clofarabine, ARA-C and TBI followed by AlloSCT. Patients will start their pre-conditioning regimen on Day -10. Patients will receive ARA-C (3000 mg/m2 \[total ARA-C dose of 18g/m2\]) daily on Days -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, and -5 and clofarabine (Dose assigned at enrollment, see section 8.2.2 for dose escalation table for Part A) on Days -9, -8, -7, -6, and -5. On days when clofarabine and ARA-C are both given, clofarabine will be given as a 2 hr infusion followed by 4 hr rest and then ARA-C given as a 3 hr infusion. Fractionated TBI (200 cGy) will be administered twice daily for 3 days on Day -4, -3 and -2. The AlloSCT will be performed on Day 0. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of tacrolimus and MMF. In Part B, this study will enroll patients with ALL or ANLL in CR3 or CR3P and without prior AlloSCT.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes may affect the body's response to and interaction with some prescription medications.

General anesthetics such as propofol and sufentanil can inhibit the central nervous system, reduce cardiac excitability and myocardial contractility, dilate peripheral blood vessels, and have a high incidence of hypotension, especially during anesthesia induction, which is particularly common in the elderly and those with underlying underlying diseases before surgery.

However, the current research on the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on perioperative cardiac function in patients is not specific, and there is no unified anesthesia strategy for these effects during the perioperative period. Therefore, this study aims to explore: 1. the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on perioperative cardiac function in patients; 2. Improve the anesthesia plan and further explore new strategies for perioperative organ protection for such patients. The research design is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.","Traditional chemotherapy is a common treatment for cancer, usually performed after surgery, with the aim of assisting in the removal of remaining cancer cells. Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hair loss, bone marrow suppression, and other common complications can even affect the function of important organs such as the heart, lungs, and brain. In the 1980s, with the reflection on traditional chemotherapy and further understanding of tumor biology, clinical trials and research began to focus on a method of neoadjuvant chemotherapy that combines surgical resection before surgery.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to the systemic chemotherapy performed before implementing local treatment methods (such as surgery), with the aim of reducing the size of the tumor, killing invisible metastatic cells early, and reducing adverse reactions to traditional chemotherapy \[6\], which is a new chemotherapy method that is beneficial for subsequent surgery, radiotherapy, and other treatments. However, it should be noted that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may still cause a certain degree of cardiac dysfunction.

As is well known, perioperative hemodynamic fluctuations, such as decreased blood pressure and heart rate, and cardiac dysfunction, are common complications after anesthesia. General anesthetics such as propofol and sufentanil can inhibit the central nervous system, reduce cardiac excitability and myocardial contractility, dilate peripheral blood vessels, and have a high incidence of hypotension, especially during anesthesia induction, which is particularly common in the elderly and those with underlying underlying diseases before surgery.

In summary, after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient\&#39;s physical and mental functions are affected to a certain extent. If combined with the effects of anesthetic drugs, the hemodynamic fluctuations are greater than those of the general population, which may further cause cardiac dysfunction and is worthy of attention.

Due to the lack of prospective studies, the dynamic changes of serum HCV RNA levels and the association of hepatitis are still unclear.

Some epidemiologic studies demonstrated an association between HCV infection and B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma and several reports showed higher prevalence of HCV infection among DLBCL patients than the controls. HCV infected DLBCL patients are reported to have distinct clinical characteristics, such as older, more with elevated LDH levels, and more with extra-nodal involvement. Regarding the impact of HCV infection on prognosis, the results are conflicting. Taiwan is an endemic area of HCV but there are limited reports addressing the clinical characteristics and prognosis in this unique population.

Therefore, the investigators initiate a prospective, multi-center observational study to clarify the dynamic association between serum HCV RNA levels and hepatitis in HCV-infected lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy.",,UNKNOWN,,2015-09,2019-08,2019-08,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,38,ESTIMATED

The characteristics of the disease varies significantly among patients where some have an indolent type of cancer, from which they will never experience symptoms while others have highly aggressive malignant disease that requires prompt therapeutic action.

Treatment of localized prostate cancer is based on a risk stratification, where patients are either offered therapy with curative intent - surgery or radiotherapy - or in case of low-risk disease an ""active surveillance"" strategy can be advised. In active surveillance the disease is monitored by PSA measurement, repeated biopsies and digital rectal examination. Some patients progress during active surveillance to a higher risk classification, which may lead to selection of active therapy.

The aim of this study is to investigate positron emission tomography (PET) with the radiolabelled tracer 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 targets the receptor urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is a known marker for aggressive disease in prostate cancer.",UNKNOWN,,2017-11-21,2022-04-01,2019-10-11,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,52,ACTUAL

TMD is frequently associated with pain and/or dysfunction such as impaired jaw function, pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), muscles and/or related structures, and associated headaches. The aetiology of TMD is multifactorial and complex.","It is known that one cause of TMD symptom development is treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC). The main treatment modalities for HNC include radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy and surgical intervention, either as a single therapy or a combination therapy. In the head and neck region, the anatomical structures are necessary for essential functions such as speech, swallowing, breathing, smell, and taste. The treatment of head and neck tumours may frequently impair some of these functions, which may result in pain, oral dysfunction, and impaired health-related quality of life.

High intensity laser therapy (HILT) is a non-invasive and painless treatment method. The latest studies have reported the beneficial effects of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser therapy in patients with pain. The advantage of HILT over low level laser therapy (LLLT) is that HILT is able to penetrate and stimulate wider and/or deeper areas; thus, considerably more energy may be transmitted to tissue during HILT therapy compared to LLLT.",COMPLETED,,2023-05-21,2025-02-10,2024-12-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,60,ACTUAL

AL increases post-operative mortality, decreases long-term survival, reduces the functional result and reduces qual-ity of life. Studies suggest that performing an indocyanine-green enhanced fluorescent angi-ography (ICGeFA), blood perfusion in the bowel can be visualised. It is suggested that using this procedure the relative risk of AL is reduced about 54-67%.

With this project we wish to evaluate the feasibility of the procedure, and, if proven feasible, to plan further studies evaluating the procedure.","Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer-diagnosis in Denmark. In 2014, 5186 pa-tients with colorectal cancer were registered. 1674 patients had cancer in the rectum and 1316 in the sigmoid colon. 668 patients underwent surgery with low anterior resection (LAR) and primary anastomosis, and 850 patients had a sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis.

A serious complication is anastomotic leakage (AL). In 2014 a total of 67 (10%) patients were registered with AL.

In general AL increases the post-operative mortality, decreases long-term survival and reduces the functional result and thereby reduces quality of life.

Due to the possible severity of AL all measures possible should be taken to ensure an early diag-nosis and timely treatment, as this has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. The symp-toms of AL are uncharacteristic; the diagnosis cannot only rely on the development of clinical symptoms. However, specific clinical scoring symptoms, measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) and radiologic examinations are proven useful.

Treatment of AL varies with the degree of leakage, from conservative treatment with rectal lavage, endo-VAC therapy, drainage of abscesses, re-laparoscopy or laparotomy with a diverting stoma, and finally to break down the anastomosis and creating a temporary or permanent colostomy, all procedures with or without antibiotic treatment.

It is essential that surgeons continuously strive to improve the operative technique with regard to anastomosis construction. Many factors influence the anastomotic healing: instrumentation error, tension on the anastomosis, bacterial contamination, etc. An important factor to ensure most opti-mal conditions in anastomotic healing is to ensure sufficient blood-supply/oxygen tension.

The surgeon evaluate so-called surrogates of bowel perfusion (evaluation of colour, mesenteric pulsation and arterial bleeding) prior to form the anastomosis, but studies have demonstrated that surgeon's intraoperative judgment in predicting of anastomotic leakage AL has an extremely low sensitivity and specificity.

Studies suggest that performing an indocyanine-green enhanced fluorescent angiography (ICGeFA), the blood perfusion in the bowel can be visualised. It is suggested that by evaluating perfusion of bowel ends, and, if needed, doing a re-resection, the risk of anastomotic leakage can be diminished. It is suggested that evaluating the anastomosis with ICG-FA and revising the anas-tomosis if necessary, the relative risk reduction of AL is about 54-67%. Several studies in robotic and laparoscopic colorectal surgery, confirms feasibility of using ICGeFA, also showing promising results in evaluating the bowel perfusion. Most studies and a newly published systematic review conclude that there is great need for larger controlled studies or randomised trails.

The primary objective with this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using ICGeFA in colorectal surgery and to evaluate if the surgeon's interpretation is dose and time dependent. Secondary ob-jective is to establish a nationwide research team, joining all the Robotic Surgery Centres in Den-mark for future research.

Last we wish to identify the optimal design for a further study, evaluating whether ICG is a helpful tool in diminishing the risk of anastomotic leakage.",COMPLETED,,2017-04-01,2018-11-30,2018-11-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,55,ACTUAL

NCT03088176,Combining Talimogene Laherparepvec With BRAF and MEK Inhibitors in BRAF Mutated Advanced Melanoma,A Phase 1b Trial of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Combination With Dabrafenib and Trametinib in Advanced Melanoma With an Activating BRAF Mutation,The purpose of the study is to determine safety and tolerability of the combination of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in BRAF mutated advanced melanoma.,"While targeted therapies can successfully block oncogenic signaling in BRAF mutant melanoma, activation of an immune response with agents such as talimogene laherparepvec can induce durable responses in a subset of patients. Combining BRAF inhibitors and immunotherapy may specifically target the BRAF driver mutation in the tumor cells and potentially sensitize the immune system to target tumors.

The study will enroll up to 20 patients with advanced melanoma and activating mutations in the BRAF gene for the local administration of talimogene laherparepvec in conjunction with oral therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, to describe the safety and tolerability of this combination.

Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal lesions with or without image ultrasound guidance. Talimogene laherparepvec will not be administered into any visceral organ or mucosal membrane lesions. The initial dose of talimogene laherparepvec is up to 4.0 mL of 106 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL. Subsequent doses of talimogene laherparepvec are up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL. The second dose of talimogene laherparepvec (the first dose of the 108 PFU formulation), will be administered at least 21 days following the initial dose. Subsequent doses will be given approximately every 2 weeks.

Dabrafenib at a dose of 150mg will be self-administered orally twice per day. Trametinib at a dose 2mg will be self-administered orally once per day.

Subjects will be evaluated by physical exam at the beginning of Cycle 1 (Week 1), Cycle 2 (Week 4), Cycle 3 (Week 6), Cycle 4 (Week 8), and every two cycles thereafter. Subjects will be evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (defined in protocol) at Cycle 2 (Week 4), Cycle 3 (Week 6), and Cycle 4 (Week 8). Efficacy evaluation will be performed by tumor measurements using clinical assessment, CT or PET/CT every 4 cycles with the first non-baseline measurement prior to Cycle 4. Tumor response will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Adverse events will be recorded and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). Other safety assessments will include clinical laboratory values and physical exam findings. Reporting of adverse events, serious adverse events, and documentation of concomitant medications will occur as needed and at every cycle. Biopsy of a melanoma lesion (preferably uninjected) should occur at least one day prior to Cycle 4 (Week 8). Blood for biomarker analysis will be obtained immediately prior to the on-treatment biopsy, or if the on-treatment biopsy cannot be performed, immediately prior to Cycle 4 (Week 8).",UNKNOWN,,2017-06-25,2021-06-30,2020-11-30,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,4,ACTUAL
NCT05989776,Increasing Access to Fertility Preservation for Women with Breast Cancer,Assessment and Improvement of Regional Information and Coordination Tools to Promote Access to Fertility Preservation,"The EVAPREF project aims to increase access to fertility preservation by developing an approach to improve and evaluate existing information and coordination tools developed by the Pays-de-la-Loire and Occitanie Regional Cancer networks. First, the investigators will use a qualitative, iterative, user-centered and participatory approach to improve the current tools and create training content for the physicians who will use these tools. Second, the investigators will conduct a randomized stepped wedge trial of women under 40 newly treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer. The investigators will evaluate the rate of fertility preservation consultation before and after implementation of the improved tools, over a 30-month period from mid-2023 to the end of 2025. Finally, in a third step, the investigators will study their approach (context-sensitive implementation analysis) and provide key elements for its transferability to other contexts and in particular to other Regional Cancer networks in France.","Background:

With the increase in the number of long-term survivors, interest is shifting from cancer survival to life and quality of life after cancer. These include consequences of long-term side effects of treatment, such as gonadotoxicity. Fertility preservation is becoming increasingly important in cancer management. International recommendations agree on the need to inform patients prior to treatments about the risk of fertility impairment and refer them to specialized centers to discuss fertility preservation. However, the literature reveals suboptimal access to fertility preservation on an international scale, and particularly in France, making information for patients and oncologists a potential lever for action. The overall goal is to improve access to fertility preservation and related consultations for women with breast cancer through the development and evaluation of a combined intervention targeting the diffusion of information for these patients and brief training for oncologists.

Methods:

First, the investigators will use a qualitative, iterative, user-centered and participatory approach to improve existing information tools and create training content for oncologists (Aim 1). Second, the investigators will conduct a randomized stepped-wedge trial evaluating rate of fertility preservation consultation over a 30-month period (Aim 2). The investigators will include 750 women aged 18 to 40 newly treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer at one of 6 participating centers. The primary outcome will be rate of fertility preservation consultation before and after using the combined intervention (informational brochure for patients and brief training for oncologists) and will be analyzed using linear regression models.Third, the investigators will analyze their approach (context-sensitive implementation analysis) and provide key elements for transferability to other contexts in France (Aim 3).

Discussion:

After transitioning to the combined intervention, the investigators will expect to observe an increase in access to fertility preservation consultation. Particular attention will be paid to the effect of this intervention on socially disadvantaged women, who are known to be at greater risk of inappropriate treatment. In addition, the user-centric design principles and participatory approaches used to optimize the acceptability, usability and feasibility of the combined intervention will likely enhance its impact, diffusion and sustainability.",RECRUITING,,2022-06-01,2026-12,2025-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,OTHER,750,ESTIMATED

These are due to mucositis and swelling in the surrounding pharyngeal tissue and on the long-term fibrosis. The ET is a small channel from the middle ear to the upper part of the pharynx. It is normally closed but briefly opens while swallowing or yawning. The ME pressure then equalizes and optimize sound conduction to the inner ear. If the function of the ET is impaired it can lead to negative pressure and effusion. This causes pain, tinnitus, otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media (COM) and hearing loss. Last can be none reversible. Almost everyone experience middle ear morbidity short after RT, but on the long-term up to 20 % have chronic otitis media and TD with significant hearing impairment and the need for hearing aid. Conventional treatment with insertion of ventilation tubes in to the tympanic membrane is not recommended for radiation-induced ME problems.

Methods and materials: The investigators will by randomized controlled trials examine the effect of auto-inflation of the ET on ME morbidity with a custom-made balloon called Otovent®.

NCT05801276,ctDNA Methylation for Detecting Ovarian Cancer,Exploration of Plasma CDO1 and HOXA9 DNA Methylation for Detecting Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: A Clinical Trial in China,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most dangerous and leading gynecological cancer, with significant cancer-related mortality among women. However, current detection methods are still limited, with approximately 70% of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer often being advanced at the initial diagnosis and more than 80% with intraperitoneal spread. The five-year survival rate for late detection is only 29%; on the contrary, if detected early, the five-year survival rate can reach 92%. Therefore, early diagnosis and detection are essential in diagnosing and treating ovarian cancer. Liquid biopsy has attracted widespread attention because of its non-invasive, real-time, and dynamic characteristics. Cell-free DNA in plasma can identify a small tumor burden well and reflect the clinical cancer information of cells.The role of hypermethylation in developing malignant tumors has received increasing attention. Methylation is one of epigenetics and plays a vital role in the occurrence and development of tumors. According to previous research basis of the researchers, it has been found that CDO1 and HOXA9 genes show hypermethylation in ovarian cancer, and they are considered one of the biomarkers for detection. Therefore, this study will further explore the detection of CDO1 and HOXA9 methylation levels based on cell-free DNA in blood and compared with ovarian pathology results; the application of methylation detection technology in ovarian cancer/precancerous lesions will further explore the application value of non-invasive diagnosis and prognostic follow-up.This study will involve three centers and is expected to enroll more than 1,400 clinical subjects, further examine the consistency of methylation detection kits with the histopathological examination, ROMA index, and Sanger sequencing results, and obtain sensitivity and specificity technical performance parameters.","This study has two phases: the ""Clinical Performance Validation"" cohort and the ""Assay Accuracy Verification"" cohort.

Researchers want to learn which method helps people to recover more completely and more quickly after surgery.

The 2 kinds of pain control are intravenous (IV) pain management and epidural pain management.","Study Groups:

If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. For every participant assigned to Group 1, 3 participants will be assigned to Group 2. This means you are 3 times more likely to be assigned to Group 2 than you are to Group 1.

* Group 1 will receive IV pain management.
* Group 2 will receive epidural pain management.

Group 1:

IV pain management will be given through a needle in your arm. This needle will be placed when you are either in the holding area or in the operating room. You will have this needle placed no matter if you take part in this study or not. The needle is used to give drugs and manage fluids during surgery.

After surgery, your doctor will set the limit for the highest dose of pain medication that you can receive at any time, but you will be able to use a hand-held button to adjust your drug according to the level of pain you may be having.

If your pain is not well controlled, the study staff may decide you can be switched to Group 2 if it seems to be in your best interest.

Group 2:

Epidural pain management will be given through a needle inserted into the space between the covering of your spinal cord and the cord itself. This area is full of fluid and is called the epidural region. The needle will be placed before your surgery, either in the holding area or in the operating room by the doctor that gives your anesthesia.

If your epidural does not work, the study staff may decide you can be switched to Group 1 if it seems to be in your best interest.

Both Groups:

During your surgery, you will have a catheter (sterile flexible tube) placed in an artery. This catheter will be used to provide additional fluid and blood support and to monitor you during surgery. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form.

During surgery, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn before you receive anesthesia. This blood will be drawn using one of the IV lines that you already have in place for your surgery. This blood will be tested to look for certain proteins called cytokines that may help researchers to understand how your body is responding to pain and how pain is affecting the healing process.

You will be asked to sign a separate consent form that describes the surgery and its risks in detail. The study staff will also tell you about the standard pain medications, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

After Surgery:

After your surgery, you will go to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for recovery. You will have a physical exam to check your recovery. Your vital signs will also be measured. You will be asked how you are feeling. Your doctor(s) will decide whether you will go from the PACU to the intensive care unit (ICU), overnight recovery suite, or will be moved to a regular post-surgical recovery floor room, where your recovery will be watched.

On Days 1, 3, and 5 after your surgery, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for cytokine testing. This blood will be drawn along with the other routine blood work that you will have after your surgery.

If you are in Group 2, a member of the MD Anderson Pain Service will check your epidural site every day to make sure that it is working and that there are no problems with the area around your epidural. A nurse will also check during each shift (about every 8-10 hours) to see how well you are able to move and how the epidural is affecting your feeling in the area it is supposed to be working in.

In both groups, you will be asked to rate your level of pain management on a scale of 0-10. When you first come out of surgery, this pain rating will happen about every hour. Your pain will also be rated about every hour if you are assigned to the surgical ICU. When you get to your room (overnight recovery or surgical floor), it will happen about every 4 hours. You can use your call bell to let a nurse know if your pain is intolerable between the nurses checks.

Questionnaires:

Before your surgery, you will fill out questionnaires about the pain and your quality of life. This should take about 20 minutes to complete.

From the day after surgery (Day 1) through Day 5, you will also be asked to fill out questionnaires about your recovery and any side effects and symptoms you may be having from the pain medication. This will take about 20-40 minutes.

While you are in the hospital, you will be asked to answer some questions that will measure how quickly you recover from the sedation used during your surgery. Each shift (about every 8-10 hours), a nurse will ask you questions to find out how quickly you are recovering from anesthesia.

Length of Study Participation:

The pain medication or epidural insertion will be stopped early if you are having intolerable side effects or if the medication is not working.

Your participation in the study will be over after Day 5.

This is an investigational study. IV pain management and epidural pain management are FDA approved and commercially available. Randomly assigning you to a type of pain management and comparing the treatments is being done for research purposes only.

Additionally, the combination of the 2 agents may have additive or synergistic effects therapeutically.

In Cycle -1, odd numbered patients will receive oral thalidomide daily days 1-14 followed by no treatment on days 15-28. Even numbered patients will receive oral lenalidomide daily on days 1-14 and then no treatment on days 15-28.

NCT03905876,Psychological Experience of Discontinuation an Early Phase Treatment by Patients,Psychological Experience of the End of the Treatment During a Clincal Trial of the Early Phase and Role of the Initial prédispositions ( VRAIMENT),"While there is currently some study on the motivations and experiences of patients integrating early phase clinical trials, to our knowledge, no study has explored the future of patients coming out of these trials. It is therefore urgent to better understand the feelings and experiences of patients who discontinue their treatment in a clinical trial of early phase (EP) to provide them with tailored and personalized support. In addition, the end of treatment may have a different impact on the person depending on whether the treatment was discontinued due to the protocol (the patient received the full treatment as planned) or to an early withdrawal (intolerable toxicities or progression of the disease).","EP trials are crucial in the development of a new cancer treatment. Given the side effects and limited knowledge of any new treatment, the inclusion of patients in this EP faces ethical barriers and communication barriers. This is all the more true as EPs are generally aimed at patients with advanced cancer. Also, faced with these different issues, volunteer patients usually have ambivalent motives. Catt and his collaborators have shown that the primary motivations for agreeing to integrate an early phase are the medical benefits, then the best option available, the maintenance of hope and only then, the aid to research.

And more, at the beginning of a EP trial, most patients simultaneously experience multiple complex symptoms related to their cancer or treatment. These symptoms and their functional consequences generate psychological distress and reduce their quality of life related to health. Measuring psychological distress and quality of life before entering a clinical trial is therefore essential for the analysis of psychopathological processes.

Since emotional regulation involves many aspects, it seems scientifically relevant to choose central scales, which cover broad psychopathological functions, to capture the psychological distress of patients.

This approach aims to minimize or circumvent the organ dysfunction and subsequent decline in quality of life associated with radical surgery, with improving disease-free survival (DFS), while . Consequently, we propose to initiate a multicenter clinical trial to examine the medium- and long-term effectiveness of complete neoadjuvant therapy (comprising either short-course radiotherapy or long-course chemoradiation, followed by consolidation chemotherapy with mFOLFOXIRI) in increasing organ preservation rates in patients with low rectal cancer.","This randomised, open-label, multicentre,phase II trial began in December, 2022, as a neoadjuvant trial about short-course radiotherapy or long-course chemoradiation followed by mFOLFOXIRI consolidation chemotherapy,in patients aged 18 years to 70 with clinical stage II-III locally advanced low rectal cancer from six Chinese institutions. The primary endpoint of the study was the 1-year organ preservation rate, with a comparison to historical data. Additionally, the study compared the differences between two radiotherapy regimens within the TNT treatment and explored biomarkers to predict tumor response

Patients with local advanced rectal cancer (cT2-4aN0-2,M0, 8cm from the anus verge) were recruited. Patients receive short-course radiotherapy (25Gy/5 times) followed by consolidation chemotherapy or long-course chemoradiation (50Gy/25 times;capecitabine 825 mg/m² twice daily) with mFOLFOXIRI (Irinotecan 150 mg/m2 iv gtt (2h) d1, Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 iv gtt (2h) d1, Calcium folinate 400 mg/m2 iv gtt (2h) d1, Total amount of fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 iv gtt (48h)), treatment repeats every 14 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The efficacy evaluation occurs after the fourth and eighth chemotherapy cycle. Patients showing a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) with reduction or stability in tumor size are advised to continue and complete all planned consolidation chemotherapy. However, if the evaluation indicates stable disease with an increase (SD increased) or progressive disease (PD), and if an R0 resection (complete removal of the tumor with no cancer cells at the margins) is feasible, radical total mesorectal excision (TME) should be pursued. In cases where R0 resection is not achievable, the treatment should align with the guidelines for managing unresectable rectal cancer. Upon the final efficacy assessment after the eighth chemotherapy cycle, several pathways are considered based on the outcomes: patients achieving a clinical complete response (cCR) may proceed to a Watch \& Wait approach. Those with a near clinical complete response (near cCR) undergo local transanal resection. If the patient's condition is evaluated as PR/SD with a reduction but does not qualify as near cCR, radical TME is recommended. For patients showing SD with an increase or PD, yet with a potential for R0 resection, radical TME is again the suggested course of action. If R0 resection is unattainable, treatment should adhere to the guidelines for unresectable rectal cancer.",RECRUITING,,2022-12-12,2025-12,2025-06-30,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,66,ESTIMATED

Surgical resection of cutaneous lesions may lead to significant organ dysfunction and/or permanent disfigurement requiring reconstructive surgery (i.e. nose, eye area, ears, medial canthus, nasolabial fold, lip, scalp, etc.). In contrast, electroporation therapy may offer equivalent disease control to conventional surgery with a lessened need for reconstructive surgery.

Although surgical resection is considered as the radical treatment, most patients were not amenable to surgery due to the initial diagnosis of advanced pancreatic cancer. For those patients, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), recommended as the local treatment, combining with chemotherapy is the optimal treatment. Despite improved knowledge about the genetic background and an increasing understanding of the tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, although efficient for many solid malignancies, including metastatic melanoma and lung cancer, have not yielded any clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer.

In addition to immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) has shown promising efficacy in hematologic malignancies. Nowadays, adoptive cell therapy includes CD8+ T cells and NK cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors. However, due to limited technology, expansion of specific CD8+ T cells is quite difficult. Additionally, there is lack of specific tumor antigens in solid tumors, which results in unsatisfactory outcomes of CAR-T and CAR-NK cells targeting solid tumors. Therefore, novel cell therapies may provide insights into therapies for solid tumors. Recently, vNKT and γδT cells used in trials of cell therapy have aroused attention.

NKT cells possess both phenotypes of T cells and NK cells. Hence, NKT cells could secret various cytokines and chemokines after stimulations to enhance anti-tumor immunity independent of MHC. Also, cytotoxic effects of NKT cells could be activated via T cell receptors (TCR) targeting specific antigens. There are two kinds of NKT cells. One is classic NKT cells with invariant TCR which are specialized CD1d-restricted T cells that recognize lipid antigens, called iNKT (invariant NKT) cells. The other is non-CD1d-restrcited. This CD8+ NKT cells has more potent anti-tumor effects than conventional T and NK cells, which is manifested by killing tumor cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells. Owing to recognition of MHC-restricted antigens via diverse TCRs, they are called vNKT (variant NKT) cells.

Furthermore, our previous studies has clarified favorable outcomes from the synergy of SBRT plus immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of SBRT plus vNKT cell adoptive therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer.",RECRUITING,,2023-06-25,2025-03-01,2024-03-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,29,ESTIMATED

Patient reported outcome and experience measures (PROM and PREM) constitute a cornerstone of the collective efforts to improve and personalize healthcare systems. The EORTC quality of life (QOL) group developed instruments evaluating general and disease specific oncology QOL questionnaires, and the quality of information received. Implementation of PREM and relevant PROM is essential for equity, better resources utility, accessibility and patient centered treatment.

Objectives:

The investigators describe the EORTC INFO 25 translation process followed by investigation of subpopulation where action is most needed. The investigators investigate which QOL questionnaire better reflects clinical parameters among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.

Design:

A prospective cohort. Setting Tertiary, referral, head and neck dedicated surgical service.

Participants:

Consecutive head and neck cancer adult patients, surgically treated, recruited between January to December 2022.

Exposures:

The investigators prospectively analyzed the new EORTC INFO 25 Hebrew questionnaire together with previously established Arabic translated version and the general (QLQ-C30) and specific (QLQ - H\&N43) oncology QOL questionnaires.

Main Outcomes and Measures:

Analyzing the quality of information provided and desired in diverse HNC subgroup of patients.

Analyzing which of PROM questionnaire better reflects HNC patients' disease and treatment parameters, which in turn, may predict poorer QOL.

Results:

The investigators recruited 60 patients, consisting of equal female: male ratio, of which 16.66% were native Arabic speaking. Validated INFO 25 scores (median 62.6±17.5) were not associated with patients' age, sex, education status, disease, and treatment parameters. Yet, the Arabic spoken sub-population had significantly lower scores (p\<0.001).

In contrast to QLQ-C30, clinical imperative associations were demonstrated between QLQ - H\&N43 and patients' disease stage (P\<0.001), admission days (p\<0.0001), free flap reconstruction (P\<0.001) and adjuvant radiotherapy (P\<0.001).

Conclusions and relevance:

The final version of the native EORTC INFO25 translation was approved by the EORTC. The investigators demonstrate lower INFO25 scores among the Arabic speaking population, suggesting frail equity and accessibility. In order to improve patients' centered treatment and resource utilization, the investigators reveal a strong association between disease severity and treatment aggressiveness and poor quality of life on specific, HNC oriented, EORTC QLQ - H\&N43 questionnaire that was not validated on EORTC QLQ-C30, which can be omitted.",,COMPLETED,,2022-01-01,2024-06-08,2022-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,60,ACTUAL
NCT06101394,Development of a Fluorescent Visualization System for Non-visible Lung Cancer Nodules,Study Protocol for Near-infrared Molecular Imaging for Lung Cancer Detection and Treatment During Mini-invasive Surgery (Phase II Trial) - (the RECOGNISE Study),"To date, lung resection and lymphadenectomy remain the best curative option in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to a frequent diagnoses of indeterminate lung lesions, many of which require surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention. Additionally, pre-operative imaging assessment frequently underestimates lymph-node involvement. Finally, the increase in the utilization of minimally invasive procedures remains mandatory.

The aim of our project is to verify if Cetuximab-IRDye800 could detect cancer nodules and lymph node metastases during minimally invasive thoracic surgery. A result favoring the use of Cetuximab-IRDye800 would permit the use of a minimally invasive approach to a more significant number of patients, which are presently operable only by a traditional ""open"" approach. Consequentially, it would lead to an improvement in surgical outcomes, a reduction of costs, and an enhanced patient quality of life.

In addition, a result favoring Cetuximab-IRDye800 could consent to correctly remove mislead metastatic lymph nodes (i.e., unexpected lymph-nodes metastasis) and neoplastic localization unidentified at pre-operative diagnostic assessments. It would lead to more accurate cancer staging, and a tailored post-operative treatment. Finally, the investigators expect to validate using Cetuximab-IRDye800 as an optimal tracker that can be easily applied intraoperatively during minimally invasive surgical procedures.","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the European Union (EU) (267,000 deaths/year) and the fourth most common cancer (321,000 new cases/year). To date, radical surgery remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to frequent diagnoses of indeterminate lung lesions, many requiring surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention.

For example, available data showed that 5.9 % of the European population over 15 years of age consumed at least 20 cigarettes per day (8.4 % in the male population), and around 12.6 % consumed less than 20. The recent lung cancer screening studies documented a prevalence of indeterminate pulmonary nodules as high as 50% in high-risk smokers, with a cancer detection rate in the overall screened population of 1%. Fascinatingly, 69% of screen-detected lung cancers were detected at early stage IA or IB.

Finally, studies on lung cancer screening, like the NELSON trial, showed a 26% reduction in lung cancer deaths at 10 years. The potential social impact of the present project is linked to establishing this screening program in Europe. One could estimate that if applied in the high-risk European population (i.e., high smokers), the screening could identify 3.5 million indeterminate pulmonary nodules, of which 250,000 are early-stage lung cancer. \[2\] Therefore, using the NIR-tracker the investigators propose could consent to a minimally invasive surgery in this scenario as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Consequently, it could determine the reduction of time to diagnosis, morbidity, mortality, and costs of postoperative care associated with more invasive surgical procedures.

To date, lung anatomical resection with lymphadenectomy remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to frequent diagnoses of indeterminate lungs, many requiring surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention.

Nevertheless, the increase in the utilization of minimally invasive procedures (e.g., video-assisted thoracic surgery -VATS- and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery -RATS- ) remains mandatory in order to reduce the significant morbidity of classic surgery, the surgical trauma, to preserve organs function and to improve patient's quality of life. Nevertheless, minimally invasive surgery represents the surgical approach of choice in less than 40% of lung anatomical resections conducted in Europe. One of the significant issues that hinder the application of VATS and RATS to most early-stage NSCLC patients is the difficulty of recognizing lung nodules located deep in the lung parenchyma and, consequently, not visible with the traditional camera system. Indeed, VATS and RATS do not consent to manual lung palpation, making localizing the not superficial lung nodule problematic.

Several approaches have been developed to enhance the localization of indeterminate lung nodules and decrease the time to diagnosis and rate of conversion to open surgery. Nevertheless, none of these is 100% sensitive or without complications, also of severe grade.

Numerous pre-operative methods are being employed, including percutaneous CT-guided placement techniques, encompassing the use of microcoils, hook-wires, and spiral-wires. These devices can support nodule localization during minimally invasive lung procedures; nevertheless, they could be easily displaced during patient transport and positioning, intraoperative atelectasis, single lung ventilation, and surgeon manipulation. Moreover, some locations of the lung as the apex, near the diaphragm, and the proximity of mediastinum and great vessels. Furthermore, all these pre-operative localization techniques require two different procedures, one for the CT-guided referral placement and one for surgical treatment. Finally, the rate of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema are not insignificant, and these complications are mandatory to avoid in several sub-groups of patients. Other pre-operative methods encompass the use of dye marking by methylene blue or fluorescent. \[8\] Nevertheless, the accuracy of the staining of the targeted area is greatly affected by the time between tumor marking and thoracoscopy. In particular, the significant impact is on the difficulty in dye visualization during operation, limited information on lesion depth, and rapid diffusion of dye into surrounding lung parenchyma between the time of injection and surgery. Of note, methylene blue has limited application in patients with anthracotic pigmentation. Moreover, also these techniques require two procedures for diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, these procedures remain complicated by the risk of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, dye air embolism, and cerebrovascular accident, and cases of lethal anaphylaxis to the dye of choice.

On the other hand, clinical pre-operative staging and surgical planning are based on pre-operative images taken before surgery, either by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These pre-operative imaging assessments frequently underestimate lymph node involvement and secondary localizations. This results in an upstaging after surgical resection ranging from 9 to 24 % in clinical Stage I lung cancer. \[10, 11\] Nevertheless, the current system of intraoperative imaging, based on direct injection of a tracker in the principal tumoral mass, demonstrated a substantial limitation in lung cancer. This is principally due to the deeper location of the lymph node, usually profoundly engaged in normal fat tissue, and to the irregular lymph node drain system in the respiratory region.

In this context, intraoperative fluorescence imaging can enhance the real-time identification of cancer cells during minimally invasive surgical procedures. This could overcome the difficulty of finding cancer nodules located deep in the lung parenchyma, not visible on the surface of normal, uninvolved tissue. The Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700-1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, which provides high contrast between the target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a more comprehensive dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence because of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. However, the conventional near-infrared (NIR) indocyanine green (ICG) method demonstrated a significant limitation in deep cancer recognition, principally due to its intrinsic low-depth tissue penetration. Similarly, the lymph-node sentinel approach conducted by the ICG method proved to be inefficient, mainly due to the non-specificity of the tracker and the irregular pathway of pulmonary lymph node drainage.

The IRDye® 800CW is an indocyanine-type NIR fluorophore with peak absorption at 775 nm and peak excitation emission at 796 nm. It provides a quantum yield of 9% with an extinction coefficient of 242,000 M-1cm-1. It has a molecular weight of 962 Da. The IRDye® 800CW demonstrated enhanced tissue penetration compared to other NIR dyes.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 53-amino acid cytokine (6.2 kDa) that is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands. EGF stimulates the growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play essential roles in cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, neovascularization, adhesion, migration, differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors, which include EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4); and is commonly overexpressed in lung cancer. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody able to inhibit and degrade the EGFR. Given by intravenous infusion (IV), Cetuximab binds to the EGFR and stops the binding and activation of the downstream signaling pathways. Moreover, as the investigators previously published, EGFR mutation is linked with skip-metastasis phenomena (i.e., pathologically proved mediastinal lymph node involvement in the absence of intrapulmonary or hilar lymph node disease).

The combination with the clinical approved monoclonal antibody anti-epidermal growth factor EGFR Cetuximab (Cetuximab-IRDye800) has shown promising results as a specific tracker in other cancer types (i.e., brain, pancreas, head, and neck). The investigators hypothesize that using Cetuximab-IRDye800 during minimally invasive surgical procedures for lung cancer could overcome the limitation demonstrated by ICG and the traditional localization strategies (e.g., coil, hook, dye intra-tumoral injection). The investigators expect to validate using an optimal tracker that can be easily applied intraoperatively during minimally invasive lung surgical procedures. The investigators expect to define the optimal time window and the optimal dose of administration of the tracker. The investigators expect to discover neoplastic localization in lymph nodes and lung parenchyma not predictable pre-operatively.",RECRUITING,,2024-01,2025-12,2025-07,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,25,ESTIMATED

NCT01676194,Transarterial Chemoembolization Prior to Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Efficacy of Transarterial Chemoembolization With DC-BeadsR Prior to Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma on Patient Survival : A Prosepctive Multicentre and Randomized Study,"The hope to treat more patients with hepatocellular carcinoma successfully is however tempered by the shortage of donors leading to an increasing waiting time for liver transplantation (LT). Intention-to-treat analysis have showed that the reported excellent long-term outcome is curtailed and significantly hampered by the growing incidence of patients who must be removed from the waiting list because of tumor progression. A way to face with this issue is to treat hepatocellular carcinoma prior to LT. Among therapeutic options to impede tumor progression, Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is the most common modality used. While there are many studies concerning TACE in this setting, none are controlled studies and thus there is no firm evidence concerning its efficacy in reducing drop-out or increasing survival. Moreover TACE may induce risks (liver failure, arterial complications...) while waiting for LT. Most of the available data have been based upon analysis of patients who received a transplant and have not included patients who were eligible for LT but died, or showed progression, before it could be performed. Therefore, studies conducted on an intention-to-treat basis are needed to clarify the benefit and the risks of TACE prior to LT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","* Multicentre, prospective, randomized, 2 parallel group study
* Preoperative evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma in recipients: Tumor diagnosis will be mainly based upon EASL guidelines. HCCs will be classified according to UCSF criteria (size, number of nodules). Clinical and biological status will be updated every 3 month.
* Pre-transplant treatment:

TACE group: An emulsion of Lipiodol and a cytotoxic drug (50mg/m2 of doxorubicin) will be injected as selectively as possible. Then, an embolic agent will be used to assure stop of flow. The first injection will be performed within 10 days following enlisting and repeated every 8 weeks until LT (only if hypervascularized vital tumor tissue is again visible on CT Scan and if liver function remains within Child A stage) or until complete response. Clinical/biological follow-up will be done once a month.

Control group (no treatment until LT): clinical/biological follow-up and CT-scan every 3 month.

This prospective, multicentric, and randomized study may allow investigators to show that TACE with DC-BeadsR can significantly increase intention to treat survival of patients transplanted for HCC. We also expect that this result will be associated with less recurrence of the cancer after transplantation.

Obviously, we expect that the beneficial effect of TACE will be associated with a acceptable rate of complication related to the procedure.

* Pathologic examination: In all patients in whom LT will be performed, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma will be confirmed by a histological examination of the explanted liver.
* Dropout criteria: Patients with progression but still meeting the transplant criteria will be maintained in their respective group.

NCT01384994,Panitumumab After Resection of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer in KRAS Wild-type Patients,,"Up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) develop liver metastasis during the course of their disease. In 30-40% of patients metastasis is confined to the liver. In these patients R0-resection of metastases may contribute to marked improvement of overall survival. Primary resection of liver metastasis is possible in about 15-20% of patients (Scheele 2005, Petrelli 2005). Recent studies indicate that perioperative chemotherapy may improve survival after resection of liver metastases (Portier 2007, Nordlinger 2007). Nevertheless, there is evidence that 70-80% of patients have recurrent disease after resection of liver metastasis. Stratification for the risk of recurrence may be performed using the FONG-score (Fong 1999).

This study is designed to investigate the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR treatment using panitumumab.

The majority of patients present to the surgeon after chemotherapeutic pretreatment with various not necessarily standardized regimens. Also postoperative therapy after resection of liver metastasis is not a clearly defined standard of care in Germany.

Based on the study by Nordlinger et al. an oxaliplatin-based regimen is chosen for postoperative therapy (Nordlinger 2008). For reasons of practicability mFOLFOX6 was selected as the chemotherapy backbone for additive treatment (Allegra 2010).

Also, there is evidence that the combination of FOLFOX with panitumumab is associated with enhanced antitumor activity (Douillard et al. ESMO 2009). The experimental treatment arm will therefore evaluate the combination of FOLFOX plus panitumumab. Since in colorectal cancer monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR are not active in KRAS mutant patients, the experimental arm including panitumumab will only be performed in KRAS wild-type patients (Amado 2008).

The planned study aims to assess the efficacy of postoperative therapy with FOLFOX plus panitumumab followed by maintenance with panitumumab for 3 months in KRAS wild-type patients, compared to the historical data for standard FOLFOX chemotherapy alone, which are verified by a randomised control group without the antibody. (Figure 1: Study Design).

The study will allow preoperative treatment with regimens such as FOLFIRI, XELIRI, FOLFOX or XELOX +/-bevacizumab or +/- cetuximab. However, only those patients will be considered eligible who did not progress during preoperative therapy.

After surgery, a treatment-free interval of at least 4 weeks, but no longer than 8 weeks will be granted.

KRAS-wild-type patients (60% of all pts) will then be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to an experimental arm with FOLFOX + panitumumab or to a reference arm with FOLFOX alone. Combination treatment will be performed for a duration of 3 months, after which patients in the experimental arm will receive maintenance therapy with panitumumab for further 3 months. In the reference arm, treatment will, however, be ended after 3 months.",,UNKNOWN,,2011-08,2014-08,2013-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,111,ESTIMATED

NCT06604494,Rehabilitation Improved by Early Detection of Fisyulas Post (Pharyngo) -Total Laryngectomy by Cytokine Measurement on Drainage Fluid on the Second Post-Operative Day,Rehabilitation Improved by Early Detection of Fisyulas Post (Pharyngo) -Total Laryngectomy by Cytokine Measurement on Drainage Fluid on the Second Post-Operative Day,"Post-pharyngo-laryngectomy fistula is a frequent surgical complication, resulting in delayed patient management and reduced quality of life. A recent study has shown that the appearance of a fistula can be detected early by measuring cytokines (particularly IL10) in postoperative drainage fluids. Resumption of feeding following this surgery varies between postoperative day 5 and postoperative day 15, depending on the team\&#39;s habits. Early refeeding reduces the length of hospital stay and improves patients\&#39; quality of life. The decision to refeed is currently made without any clinical or biological marker of the quality of pharyngeal suture healing. The idea of this study is that good initial healing (evidenced by low levels of inflammatory cytokine in drainage fluids) allows early refeeding without putting the patient at additional risk.

Main hypothesis and research objectives Main hypothesis: the determination of cytokines in postoperative drainage fluids (FODP) could be a tool for screening patients at no risk of developing a fistula, and for whom early refeeding (as early as postoperative day 3) could be proposed without exposing the patient to an additional risk of developing a FODP.

Study objectives Primary objective: to compare the rate of post-(pharyngo)-total laryngectomy fistula between an early refeeding strategy (3rd or 4th postoperative day) and a late refeeding strategy (current standard of care: 7th postoperative day) in a low-risk fistula group defined according to the level of inflammatory cytokines in drainage fluids on the second postoperative day.

Secondary objectives

To compare an early versus a late refeeding strategy for patients at low risk of fistula defined according to the level of inflammatory cytokines in drainage fluids on the second postoperative day for:

* length of hospital stay,
* evolution of nutritional status,
* time to postoperative radio-chemotherapy, if indicated postoperatively,
* improvement in quality of life,
* post-operative complications other than pharyngeal fistula. Evaluation of different strategies left to the investigator\&#39;s choice (continuation of antibiotic therapy, increased delay before resumption of feeding, early resumption of surgery) in the group of patients at high risk of fistula, based on the determination of postoperative cytokines in drainage fluids.

Primary endpoint: Pharyngo-cutaneous fistula occurring within 30 days post-operatively (yes/no).

Number of subjects: 250 Inclusion criteria Major cancer patient justifying scheduled total laryngectomy or pharyngo-laryngectomy after multidisciplinary consultation.

Holder of a social security plan. Non-inclusion criteria Pregnant and breast-feeding women Persons under curatorship, guardianship, safeguard of justice or deprived of liberty.

Any medical condition deemed incompatible with the study by the investigator. Refusal to participate. Body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m2","Course of the study Patients will be recruited from the ENT departments of the Clermont Ferrand, Saint-Etienne, Lyon and Grenoble university hospitals, the Lyon (Centre Léon Bérard) and Paris (Institut Gustave Roussy) cancer centers, and the Le Puy En Velay and Valence hospitals, all of which are accredited for cervico-facial carcinology.

A multidisciplinary consultation meeting will be required to validate the surgical procedure.

Patients will be informed of the study by the investigating physician. After a period of reflection and a chance to answer any questions, the patient will be included in the study after consent has been obtained from an investigator.

The main risk factors for the development of a fistula will be recorded pre- and intraoperatively.

Surgical criteria will be common to all investigating teams. The most important of these will be the positioning of the LDPO collection drain opposite the pharyngeal closure site. The drain may or may not be aspirative, depending on local habits. The concomitant insertion of a phonatory prosthesis or a salivary bypass are not grounds for exclusion.

Post-operative care must meet precise specifications. Drainage fluids will be collected from the drainage bottle on D2 post-op. To do this, the entire drainage bottle will be recovered, and a new bottle will be placed over the drain if the drain is retained.

The liquid contained in the drainage bottle is then sterile-separated into different samples directly in the patient\&#39;s hospital ward:

* Immunological sampling. A BD Falcon™ Conical Tubes 50 mL will be sent to the immunology laboratory associated with the investigating center (Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital Immunology Laboratory for the Clermont-Fd and Le Puy en Velay sites, Lyon University Hospital Immunology Laboratory for the Grenoble, Lyon, Valence and Lyon anti-cancer center, the immunology laboratory of the Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris for the Gustave Roussy Institute and the immunology laboratory for the Saint-Etienne center). The sample is then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.a ""high-risk"" group for CPE.
* Bacteriological sampling. This sample will be sent rapidly to the bacteriology laboratory of the investigating center for standard cyto-bacteriological analysis.

For an IL 10 level on D2 post-op of less than 72pg/mL (so-called low-risk fistula group defined from the DEFILAC pilot study), two groups of patients will be constituted:

Low-risk fistula group: OPT performed on D3 or D4 (before randomization and after IL-10 results). If TPO classified according to van la Parra ≤1, patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

* ""EARLY"" group: Resumption of feeding on postoperative day 3 or 4 with a liquid or mixed diet.
* ""TARDIF"" group: return to a mixed diet from day 7 post-op. Randomization will be centralized, computerized with random block sizes, stratified by center and patient age.

If the TOP shows images classified according to van la Parra\&gt;1, patients will join the so-called high-risk CPE exploratory arm.

If IL10 levels on D2 post-op exceed 72 pg/mL (high-risk group for post-op fistula), these patients will form a third, exploratory group, whose management will be left to the investigator\&#39;s choice, with 3 possibilities (no change in investigators\&#39; habits): repeat surgery to clean the surgical site and repair the pharyngeal sutures, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy while awaiting the bacteriological results of the cytobacteriological examination of the drainage fluid on postoperative day 2, without repeat surgery, monitoring and no change in the investigator\&#39;s routine.

Postoperative complications will then be noted and classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification over a period of 30 postoperative days.

The appearance of a salivary fistula at the tracheostoma will be objectified by the appearance of saliva in the tracheostoma. The appearance of a fistula at the cervical level will be sought either by imaging methods in the event of a cervical complication (infection, hemorrhage) if no surgical revision is decided and surgically by loss of sealing confirmed surgically if a revision is necessary.

The appearance of a subsequent fistula will be noted. The patient will have a final consultation 30 days after surgery if he or she is no longer hospitalized.

The quality of life of the patients will be assessed throughout the study by completing an anxiety questionnaire and a depression questionnaire. This assessment will be done before surgery, on D5, D15 and D30 of surgery. Before surgery and at D5, these questionnaires will be completed during hospitalization. At D15 and D30, the questionnaires will be completed during hospitalization if the patient is still hospitalized or by mail if the patient has been discharged from the surgical department having performed the pharyngolaryngectomy procedure. The date of the start of chemoradiotherapy will then be noted and the time between surgery and the start of this treatment will be noted.",RECRUITING,,2025-02-12,2028-05,2028-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,PREVENTION,250,ESTIMATED

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining gemcitabine with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating pancreatic cancer.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and bevacizumab achieves superior survival compared to gemcitabine and placebo in patients with previously untreated advanced pancreatic cancer.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the objective response rates, duration of response, progression free survival, and toxicity of these two regimens in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

II. To measure baseline levels of VEGF and correlate with treatment outcome. III. To measure baseline and on treatment levels of additional growth factors that may be co- or counter- regulated with VEGF and correlate with response to treatment.

IV. To measure baseline and on treatment levels of coagulation and endothelial cell activation markers that may predict for thrombotic or bleeding risks related to treatment.

V. To generate protein expression profiles using a MALDI-TOF based platform from serum samples. To analyze and compare protein expression profiles to elucidate ion peaks that differentiate patients who respond to therapy from patients who do not respond. To identify proteins responsible for the differentially expressed ion peaks. To develop quantitative assays for each of these proteins.

VI. To assess any differences in overall survival within the treatment arm (gemcitabine + bevacizumab), between the two VEGF genotypic groups: Group 1 denoted by individuals with CT or TT genotypes and Group 2 consisting of individuals with CC genotypes.

VII. To conduct an exploratory analysis of gene-toxicity, gene-response, and gene-survival relationships for the various polymorphisms described in the genes implicated in gemcitabine pharmacology (CDA, DCK, DCTD, SLC29A1, SLC28A1, SLC29A2). An exploratory quantitative interaction between the genotypes (group 1 or 2) and the treatment arms (gemcitabine + bevacizumab or gemcitabine + placebo) in predicting overall survival will also be evaluated.

VIII. To identify specific SNPs and genetic variation that are associated with differences among patients in the risk of toxicity.

IX. To compare the effects of gemcitabine + bevacizumab versus gemcitabine + placebo on resource utilization, cost, and utilities, and if applicable, to make estimates of marginal cost-utility.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), disease extent (metastatic vs locally advanced), and prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

We propose to conduct a prospective study to evaluate therapeutic response using 18F-FDG PET before and after induction chemotherapy for locally advanced NPC patients.","In order to improve locoregional control and to eradicate micrometastases for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the preferred therapeutic approach.Although it would be of great advantage to identify non-responder during or immediately after therapy to formulate an alternative treatment strategy, non-invasive methods for early evaluation of therapeutic response for advanced NPC patients have not been fully evaluated. Decrease of tumor volume in anatomical images and relief of symptoms in clinical follow-up have been used in many conventional approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. However, an effective therapy could very well have resulted in early subclinical alterations in tumor physiology and biochemistry. These alterations may have occurred long before changes in the tumor mass become apparent. Thus therapeutic effect may not be assessed accurately using the conventional anatomical imaging studies, such as CT and MRI.Recent studies have shown that 18F-FDG PET, a whole-body imaging technology based on glucose metabolism, can effectively detect subclinical and clinical therapeutic responses at stages that are earlier than those detected by conventional approaches.We therefore propose to conduct a prospective study to evaluate therapeutic response using 18F-FDG PET before and after induction chemotherapy for locally advanced NPC patients.",UNKNOWN,,2006-03,,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,50,
NCT02319694,Intraoperative Analysis of Reward and Impulsivity in the Basal Ganglia,Intraoperative Analysis of Reward and Impulsivity in the Basal Ganglia,"This project studies the impulsive side effects of common treatments for Parkinson's Disease. By learning how parts of the brain involved in Parkinson's encode information related to reward and motivation, the investigators will better understand the reasons why Parkinson's patients often suffer from compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and repetitive tinkering (""punding""). These results may lead to the design of better methods of deep brain stimulation (DBS) that minimize the behavioral side effects of Parkinson's treatment.","While the typical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic drugs and deep brain stimulation (DBS), are proven to be effective in mitigating the motor deficits associated with the disease, these same methods also give rise to behavioral side effects including compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and complex, purposeless stereotyped behavior (""punding""). And while much work has investigated the underlying patterns of neural activity giving rise to tremor, rigidity, and other motor effects of D, little is known about the neural genesis of impulsive side effects in humans. The investigators propose to characterize the patterns of neural activity underlying these failures of impulse control in an actual PD patient population undergoing surgery for the implantation of DBS electrodes. Such procedures offer a unique opportunity to collect data at the single neuron level in humans, since surgeons rely on intraoperative electrophysiology to identify the anatomical boundaries of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the typical target of DBS in PD. Using multi-channel Ad-Tech microwire arrays, the investigators will simultaneously record multiple channels of single unit activity (both spikes and field potentials ) in STN and nearby structures while subjects perform cognitive tasks with validated links to impulsivity in human populations. In the balloon analogue risk task (BART) participants must balance risk and reward as they decide when to stop inflating a computerized balloon whose point value and risk of popping both grow with size. In the stop signal reaction task (SSRT), participants must respond as quickly as possible when a ""go"" cue appears, but countermand this response when a ""stop"" tone is played. At the neural level, the BART allows us to elucidate correlates of risk, outcome (both rewarding and aversive), and anticipation, while the SSRT, a well-studied model of impulsivity in both animal models and humans with strong links to computational models, will allow us to determine not only single unit but network-level patterns of activity underlying failures in impulse control. Through these experiments, as well as computational modeling, the investigators will characterize neural correlates of impulsivity in PD patients that will allow for the design of DBS protocols that mitigate impulsive side effects. The R21 mechanism will be used to further develop and streamline the process of multichannel recording and cognitive testing in the intraoperative setting and validate the hypothesized link between single neuron activity and models of behavior in the stop signal task.",COMPLETED,,2013-07,2017-02-27,2017-02-27,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,36,ACTUAL

NCT04705194,Hepatectomy Risk Assessment With Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Hepatectomy Risk Assessment With Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Liver resection remains the only curative option for primary or metastatic liver cancer, but a more accurate prediction of post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is needed to further reduce morbidity and mortality and to extend the indication to a wider patient population. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising new source of liver function tests as it can provide segmental function alongside measurements of perfusion, tissue structure and standard morphological assessment.

The primary aim of HEPARIM is to determine if quantitative MRI biomarkers of liver function and perfusion can improve predictions of post-hepatectomy liver function, as measured by an indocyanine green (ICG) liver function test. Secondary aims is to validate the MRI measurements of liver function against ICG.

HEPARIM is an observational cohort study recruiting patients referred locally for a one- or two-stage liver resection of 2 segments or more. Before surgery, all participants will undergo an ICG liver function test and a Dynamic Gadoxetate-enhanced (DGE) MRI scan of the liver. The ICG test will be repeated at one day after surgery. The Gadoxetate Clearance (GC) of the future liver remnant (FLR-GC) will be determined from the DGE-MRI data and correlated to the post-operative ICG R15 as primary outcome measure. Preoperative ICG R15 will be correlated against GC of the whole liver (WL-GC) to address the secondary objective. In patients that undergo a staged hepatectomy, an additional MRI and ICG test will be performed before the first stage to assess its effect on volumetric and functional growth of the FLR.

Additional pre- and postoperative data will be collected from medical records including demographics and medical histories, biochemistry, pathology and radiology reports, and any long-term outcome data collected in the 90-day follow-up visit. These data will be used in a multi-variate analysis to determine which preoperative biomarkers are most predictive of immediate and long-term outcomes, to identify the added value of functional MRI over routine clinical markers, and to derive a multi-variate prediction model that can be validated in future studies.","OBJECTIVES

(1) To determine if DGE-MRI can improve predictions of post-hepatectomy liver function; (2) To validate DGE-MRI based measurements of liver function against gold-standard liver function tests; (3a) to determine if preoperative DGE-MRI can improve predictions of post-operative PHLF; (3b) to develop a multi-parametric prediction model for 90-day post-operative outcome combining MRI, clinical chemistry and patient history; (3c) To determine the relationship between volumetric and functional liver growth after portal vein embolisation.

RECRUITMENT

Patients considered for major liver resection will be identified at the Hepatobiliary multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting at St James University Hospital Leeds, and contacted by phone. Patients will have at least 3 days to consider this information, and after that they will be contacted by the member of their clinical care team to schedule the baseline visit. Formal written consent will be obtained on the day of the visit. If they don't consent to participation, then only the MRI scans will be collected and stored in their medical records.

BASELINE VISIT

An initial dataset will be captured incorporating the patient's medical history and up-to-date investigations. This will be obtained through a combination of patient interview, review of paper notes and review of the patient's electronic medical record. An MRI safety screening form will be administered. If a contraindication to MRI is found at this point, the visit will be cancelled, and the patient will be excluded from the study. An ICG safety questionnaire will be used to exclude patients with contraindications to ICG use. Patients excluded from ICG testing at this point will not be excluded from the study as other measures of liver function will still be available for analysis of tertiary outcomes.

Patients will be cannulated and ICG will be administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg through the cannula. The ICG will be reconstituted with 5 ml of water for injection for every 25 mg of ICG, leading to a dilution of 5mg ICG per 1 ml. Serial percutaneous ICG measurements will then be taken using an ICG clearance meter using a finger clip device (LiMON; Maquet, Germany). Patients will lie in the supine position and calibration will be performed before testing starts.

In order to derive absolute ICG concentrations, two separate blood samples of 2.5mL each will be taken, both after ICG injection (pre-operative). The samples will be processed and stored in a dedicated facility in the Leeds Institute for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine (LICAMM) and analyzed as a batch at the end of the study. The remaining samples will be stored for a maximum of 5 years to measure metabolomics data for secondary research. After 5 years any remaining samples will be destroyed according to standard LICAMM procedure for sample disposal.

The MRI will be performed straight after ICG measurement in the 3 T MRI by radiographers of the department. The scan will last max 1.5hrs and will include the injection of a standard dose of MRI contrast agent Gadoxetate (Primovist, Bayer AG). The same cannula will be used to administer the MRI contrast as for the ICG test. Other scans that will be taken in the same session include T1- and T2-weighted anatomical imaging, T2\*-mapping, T1-mapping, proton-density fat fraction.

SURGERY AND FOLLOW-UP

After the baseline visit some patients will require re-discussion in the MDT and all patients will attend for a preoperative clinic appointment. A proportion of patients will not progress to surgery due to clinician or patient choice; these patients will not be followed up further. The data that has already been collected will be used for addressing the secondary objective.

Intraoperative measurements of the resected liver segments will be taken, including weight and volume (measured using fluid displacement). After surgery, data obtained as part of the patient's standard intra and post-operative care will be collected from their medical records. This includes any blood tests during admission, the characteristics of the operation, complications and length of stay. Pathology results will be collected. The ICG test with the finger-clip device will be repeated postoperatively at bedside to determine a reference value for postoperative liver function. This will be performed on day 1 post-surgery if feasible. A PHLF score will be determined according the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) definition.

All patients who underwent surgery will attend the hospital for a routine post-operative clinic appointment after 90 days. Data from this appointment will be collected by the clinical research fellow, including complications, readmissions and mortality. At the end of the study patients who have requested to do so will be sent a summary of the study's findings and implications.

PVE/ALPPS ARM

Patients requiring portal vein embolisation (PVE) or Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) will be recruited in the same way as participants in the resection arm. They will attend the same baseline visit and the routine clinic visit. Patients may decline the PVE/ALPPS at this point, or the clinician may decide it is inappropriate at the clinic appointment. If this occurs and the patient proceeds to surgery, they will remain in the study. If they do not proceed to surgery their data will be used to address the secondary objectives.

A patient who does proceed to PVE/ALPPS will attend the hospital for a routine computed tomography (CT) scan after the first stage, and a second research visit will be scheduled at that point. This visit will proceed in the same manner as the baseline visit. They will be re-discussed in the MDT and come for a preoperative clinic appointment. Patients may be deemed ineligible for surgery, or make the decision not to proceed with surgery, in which case their data already collected can feed into the secondary objectives. If they do proceed to surgery, the same intra-operative and post-operative data will be taken as for the resection arm.

SAMPLE SIZE

The aim is to recruit 134 participants into the study, which will include an estimated 122 in the primary surgery arm and 12 in the PVE arm. Of the 134 recruited participants an estimated 112 will feed into the primary objective.

The power calculation assessed the impact of study size by simulating a hypothetical population of 1 million patients and evaluating model robustness to estimate the model beta coefficient of FLR-GC in relation to ICG clearance. Modelling was informed by pilot data in 29 cases. 10k samples of 122 patients are drawn with replacement, generating empirical distributions of the parameters. Results demonstrated that even at the poorest precision simulated, the fixed sample of 122 is sufficient to obtain reliable beta coefficients.

DATA ANALYSIS

Statistical analysis shall be performed by Professor Gilthorpe at the University of Leeds using the anonymized data sheet and the RStudio software package (RStudio, Boston, USA). A univariable analysis will be performed comparing FLR-GC against post-operative ICG-R15 (primary objective) and WL-GC against preoperative ICG-R15 (secondary objective). Second the correlations will be investigated in a multivariable analysis to determine if the MRI adds value to existing preoperative biomarkers, which MRI biomarkers are most predictive, and to derive a model for predicting PHLF. It will then be tested whether this combined score is significantly worse when DGE-MRI is removed from the prediction. In the PVE/ALPPS group, changes in volume will be correlated to changes in function of the FLR between pre PVE/pre-ALPPS and post-PVE/post-ALPPS.

DATA MANAGEMENT

Identifiable data will not be accessed by researchers outside of the clinical care team and are only retained for quality control, backup, and to follow-up on any incidental findings. Anonymised research data will be recorded using the participant's study ID. Paper forms used for data capture will be stored in a secure location in St James University Hospital. Electronic research data will be stored in a participant study record in a secure database in St James University Hospital, and in password protected network drives set up and maintained by University IT. Additional databases will be set up to retain the source data for further processing, including MRI in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format, raw ICG data, and digitized histopathology slides.

MRI data will be recorded using the patient ID in the secure Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) of the radiology department. Routine radiology reports will be retrieved and included in the participant's anonymous study file. The MRI images will be transferred anonymously from the scanner to the university's DICOM database, where they will be analyzed by a research fellow to extract the relevant imaging biomarkers.

All excel sheets with anonymised study data will be transferred to a long-term data repository where they will be maintained for a minimum of 25 years. Source data for MRI and ICG will be retained indefinitely in a dedicated imaging data management system hosted by the University to enable secondary research, educational use, and data sharing.

INCIDENTAL FINDINGS AND BLINDING

All data collected for the study, except calculated MRI biomarkers and ICG measurements, are acquired as part of the routine workup and will therefore be available to the clinical care team through the patient's medical records. All ICG liver function measurements from finger clip device will be reviewed separately by the hepatology consultant. Any unusual findings will be flagged up to the clinical care team as incidental findings, and dealt with according to usual practices. For those patients that have an extra MRI scan as part of their participation in the study, these MRI's will be reviewed by a radiologist. Any unusual findings will be flagged up to the clinical care team as incidental findings, and dealt with according to usual practices. Unvalidated MRI biomarkers will not be reviewed for incidental findings or otherwise communicated to the clinical care team. The non-clinical research fellows working on analysis of MRI and ICG data will be blinded to the clinical history of the patient and other function tests.

WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS

If a patient decides to withdraw their consent to inclusion in the study at any point then no further data regarding their care will be collected. Should the patient wish, data collected up until withdrawal of consent will be destroyed using the hospital's confidential waste bins. Patients who lose their capacity to consent after initial inclusion in the study for reasons that are not related to their surgery will be treated in the same manner as if they had withdrawn consent. Previously collected data will not be destroyed. If a patient is unable to complete their MRI study for any reason they will automatically be withdrawn from the study. Data collected until the point of withdrawal will be retained.",UNKNOWN,,2019-07-08,2022-06-01,2022-03-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,134,ESTIMATED

The central hypothesis is that cannabinoid use decreases TILs in melanoma in a dose-dependent fashion. This is important because cannabinoid-driven TME changes in melanoma may alter patient outcomes mediated by TILs and response to standard of care ICI treatments.,"Specific Aim 1.Assess how systemic cannabinoids remodel tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the melanoma tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that decreased grade of TILs and exhaustive differentiation of T cells in melanoma are associated with lower cannabinoid receptor (CB1/CB2) expression and higher levels of systemic exogenous cannabinoids. Aim 1a.) Correlate plasma levels of cannabinoids with TIL grade. Aim 1b.) Correlate plasma levels of cannabinoids with TIL T cell immunohistochemical markers of exhaustion. Aim 1c.) Correlate plasma levels of cannabinoids to TIL CB1/CB2 expression.

Specific Aim 2. Determine the relationship between peripheral T cell activation and circulating cannabinoid levels in patients with melanoma. We hypothesize that the phenotypic activation of peripheral T cells is inversely associated with increased plasma levels of systemic exogenous cannabinoids. Aim 2a.) Immunophenotype peripheral T cells from patients with melanoma. Aim 2b.)

NCT06475560,Camera Capsule Endoscopy in the Routine Diagnostic Pathway for Colorectal Diseases,Camera Capsule Endoscopy in the Routine Diagnostic Pathway for Colorectal Diseases,"The Department of Surgery at Odense University Hospital (OUH) carries out approximately 10,000 colonoscopies each year, and this number is continuously increasing. Since 2014, the screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) has resulted in a significant increase in the colonoscopy workload. Conventional optical colonoscopy (OC) is a hospital-based procedure that can require sedation or analgesics and is often considered uncomfortable, intimidating, or even painful. The diagnostic yield of OC can be as low as 3-5% in some patient groups, which means that an endoscopist may need to perform 20 to 30 colonoscopies to identify one case requiring treatment. Physical or cultural barriers can also deter patients from attending appointments, leading to missed cancers or precancerous lesions. To address these challenges, an alternative pathway is needed to reduce the colonoscopy burden on the healthcare system while ensuring fewer findings are missed.

One solution is to use Colon Capsule Endoscopy (CCE) as a triage tool. This procedure can be performed in outpatient healthcare centers and requires less equipment than an OC. However, CCE offers no therapeutic capability, and individuals with clinically significant findings will still require an OC. A low reinvestigation rate (\<25%-30%) is desirable for patient preference and the economy.

Therefore, DanCap will introduce a new pathway that relies on CCE for routine colorectal examinations of symptomatic patients who are expected to have a low rate of positive findings and, consequently, a low reinvestigation rate, and asses the cost of this new pathway.","As the sensitivity of OC and CCE is constantly increasing and progressively smaller-size pathologies are detected, the association between detected lesions and patients' short- and long-term outcomes is becoming more uncertain. In some cases, such as with the resection of diminutive polyps, the number needed to treat to save one person (approx. 8.000) is very close to the number needed to cause one procedure-related death (10.000). Therefore, there is an increasing need to filter OC candidates and define a realistic threshold for treating or ignoring lesions.

The DanCap study fulfils this need by introducing a renewed approach to the diagnostic pathways using CCE. This approach offers out-of-hospital, accurate bowel diagnostics that allow for the decongestion of endoscopic services, as seen in the UK. It has an upscaling potential for national and international redesign of bowel diagnostics. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of CCE as compared to OC. The Scottish and English Services have shown the feasibility of routine use of CCE and the CCE-based services confirmed already known data with real-world equivalents regarding CCE's safety and high diagnostic quality. However, there are remaining concerns, primarily due to the high (45-60%) re-investigation rate, which makes the patient experience and cost-efficiency of CCE-based services inferior to that of the conventional OC counterpart. Based on these recent findings, setting up a routine diagnostic pathway for further evaluation of CCE in the clinical routine of patients with a low frequency of positive findings, including cost-efficiency assessment, is highly relevant. Here, introducing methods to predict a patient's findings may be extra relevant in the future. Currently, studies suggest that the use of faecal haemoglobin concentration or the microbiome composition may be useful biomarkers for colorectal cancer or precursor lesions. The predictive potential of these biomarkers in a diagnostic pathway has yet to be sufficiently tested, and more evidence is needed before clinical application is possible.

Our study aims to investigate the DanCap pathway as a viable solution for CCE-based diagnostics in symptomatic patients, considered to have a high need for endoscopic evaluation due to the symptoms compatible with neoplastic disease, as referred from general practice (GP). This approach is expected to be cost-effective and maintain high clinical quality while relieving the burden on endoscopy wards in a Danish setting.

The study will provide data for pathway cost analysis of the CCE-based pathway compared to the traditional colonoscopy pathway based on a realistic medicine outcomes assessment.

The secondary aims are to:

1. Compare the polyp detection rate (PDR) and CRC detection rates in both groups
2. Investigate the role of FIT-testing and microbiome analyses in CCE-based diagnostics for predictive purposes",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-09,2025-12,2025-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,800,ESTIMATED

Patients 18 years of age and older with recurrent or metastatic (spreading) lung, cervical, or ovarian cancer who cannot benefit from any standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination; review of pathology slides; blood and urine tests; imaging tests, including computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG); and possibly echocardiogram.

Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

Blood draw. Blood is drawn before treatment begins to establish baseline levels for future blood tests. Blood counts are done twice weekly after chemotherapy begins.

Central venous catheter placement. A plastic tube is put into a major vein in the chest. It is used to give the study drugs or other medications, including antibiotics and blood transfusions, if needed, and to withdraw blood samples. The line is usually placed under local anesthesia in the radiology department or the operating room. It can stay in the body for months or be removed after each treatment is completed.

Chemotherapy. Treatment cycles are 21 days. Both drugs are given on day 1 of each cycle. First, tariquidar is given as a 30-minute infusion. One hour after the tariquidar infusion, docetaxel is infused over 1 hour. (For the first cycle only, docetaxel is given in divided doses one week apart and tariquidar is administered on either day 1 or day 8. The order of tariquidar administration is randomized to generate optimal pharmacokinetic data. Patients will be hospitalized for several days during this cycle to gather research data). The tariquidar dose remains the same throughout the study. Docetaxel may be increased or decreased from cycle to cycle, based on side effects.","Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance remain major obstacles in the treatment of cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that in some malignancies P-glycoprotein (Pgp) can confer resistance, and that its reversal can improve therapeutic outcome. Clinical trials investigating Pgp antagonists have been hampered by the occurrence of unpredictable pharmacokinetic interactions, which have required dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic agents to avert excessive toxicity. Tariquidar (XR9576) is a new Pgp antagonist that is more potent and has prolonged activity. Phase I trials with paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and docetaxel have demonstrated that tariquidar (XR9576) has minimal pharmacokinetic interactions while surrogate studies have confirmed in vivo inhibition of Pgp-mediated drug transport.This study seeks to determine the pharmacokinetic interaction, if any between docetaxel and tariquidar and to evaluate the potential for activity in lung, ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube and cervical cancers.

Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with metastatic melanoma that has not responded to previous therapy.","OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and survival of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who have failed first-line therapy when treated with match-related allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive a preparative regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Busulfan PO is administered every 6 hours on days -7 to -4. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on days -3 to -2 followed by one day of rest. Bone marrow infusion occurs on day 0. Cyclosporine begins on day -1 and continues until day 180. Methotrexate IV is administered on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

To address this gap, a multidisciplinary investigative team with expertise in communication, medicine, nursing, and behavior-change intervention research, and a history of extensive collaboration, will conduct a survey experiment on a national sample of over 3,689 adults to identify the most promising theory-based messages to strengthen HPV vaccine intentions.",,RECRUITING,,2025-02-06,2026-03,2025-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,OTHER,3689,ESTIMATED
NCT06142760,MR-guidance in Chemoradiotherapy for Cervical Cancer,Daily AI-based Treatment Adaptation Under Weekly Offline MR-guidance in Chemoradiotherapy for Cervical Cancer 1 AIM-C1,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), consisting of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and chemotherapy, followed by brachytherapy (BT) is the standard of care for patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma. In current clinical practice, conventionally, one radiotherapy plan based on the initial planning computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pelvis is applied for the complete 5-6 weeks of EBRT. However, there is a high degree of cervix and uterus motion in the pelvis due to different fillings of the bladder and the bowel. Consequently, large safety margins are required to compensate for organ movement, potentially leading to higher toxicity. Lately, daily high-quality cone-beam CT (CBCT) guided adaptive radiotherapy, aided by artificial intelligence (AI), became clinically available. Due to the improved soft-tissue contrast, the treatment plan can now be online adapted to the current position of the tumor and the adjacent organs-at-risk (OAR), while the patient is lying on the treatment couch. Moreover, the German Research Cancer Center offers the unique possibility of additional weekly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treatment position using a shuttle system. Daily CBCT-adapted EBRT in combination with weekly MRI in treatment position might therefore offer superior sparing of surrounding OAR and consequently reduction of treatment-associated side-effects.

However, to the investigators knowledge, no toxicity data for daily CBCT/AI adaptive EBRT of locally advanced cervical cancer with additional MR-guidance exists. The AIM-C1 trial therefore aims to assess the potential of daily CBCT adaptive and AI aided EBRT combined with additional weekly offline MR-guidance in treatment position using a shuttle system.","This trial will be conducted as a prospective, one-armed phase II study in 40 patients with cervical carcinoma (FIGO stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC1), age ≥ 18 years, Karnofsky Performance Score ≥ 70%. CCRT will consist of 50.4Gy external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with concurrent cisplatin 40mg/m² as standard of care in Germany, followed by 27Gy of BT in 4 fractions of 7Gy.

The primary endpoint of the trial will be the occurrence of overall early bowel and bladder toxicity CTCAE grade 2 or higher assessed within the first 3 months with NCI CTCAE Version 5.0.

Secondary outcomes to be investigated are clinical feasibility of daily CBCT-guided and weekly MR-guided plan adaptation, local tumor control, distant tumor control, progression-free survival, overall survival, quality of life, acquisition and comparison of different MRI sequences, technical analyses of treatment, adaptation frequency and morphological as well as functional tumor characteristics of the MRI.",RECRUITING,,2023-11-15,2026-05-01,2025-11-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,40,ESTIMATED

This may lead to escape of cancer cells and tilt the scales toward a more protumorigenic microenvironment. Volatile agents, in particular, have been shown to exhibit profound immunosuppressive effects. In comparison, propofol has a favorable profile and inhibits cancer cell activity. Determining ""cancer-protective"" role of TIVA with propofol presents an exciting window of opportunity that has potential to improve outcomes in cancer patients undergoing resection surgery","For the current study, consenting patients planned for upfront surgery, will be randomly allocated to 2 groups- 20 patients each group: Propofol TCI-based Total Intravenous Anesthesia group (Propofol group) and Sevoflurane group (Sevoflurane group), according to computer generated randomization number.

Patients will be monitored routinely with ECG, non invasive blood pressure, and a pulse- oximetery (SPO2), every 5 min. An intravenous access will be established with 20- 22 G cannula. A perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis will be given to all patients. None of the patients will receive any premedication.

After preoxygenation with 100% O2 for 3 min: group specific separate interventions will be performed.

Patient will be ventilated with TV of 6-8ml/kg,respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO2 value between 40 - 45 mmHg. Crystalloids will be used for hydration (4-6 ml/kg/h), and intraoperative volume deficits will be replaced by additional administration of a solution according to clinical needs. For TIVA group, the depth of anaesthesia will be monitored using Bispectral Index, with target BIS value between 40 and 60. For Sevoflurane group, the depth of anaesthesia will be monitored using MAC, with target MAC value between 0.8 and 1. Half hour before conclusion of surgery, all patients will receive 0.1mg/kg of ondansetron as prophylaxis for PONV. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation will be reversed by glycopyrrolate (10mcg/kg) and neostigmine (50mcg/kg).

Patients in both groups will receive intra-venous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 1-1.5mg/kg diclofenac + Paracetamol 1gm just before conclusion of surgery for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative pain \& PONV will be managed as per institutional protocols.

Radiation dermatitis occurs in up to 65% of these patients; currently, there is no standard of care for this treatment-related toxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability (Phase I) and preliminary efficacy (Phase II) of prophylactic esomeprazole cream (termed ""Dermaprazole"") in patients who require radiation for breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.","All study participants will begin using Dermaprazole for 1-2 weeks prior to receiving radiation. During the CT Simulation, study participants will be instructed to apply Dermaprazole in a ""patch test"" area - an area of the chest outside of the field of radiation. This is to assess for immediate skin reactions including itching, irritation and allergy. If there are no immediate allergic reactions at the conclusion of the simulation visit, the study participant will be instructed to apply the cream in the patch test for 2-4 days to assess for contact dermatitis and if no itching or rash at that time (evaluation will be conducted via phone call). Patients will be questioned regarding any visible skin changes or irritation (itching, peeling, scaling), and patients responding in the affirmative will be asked to present for clinic visit or send photographs for visual classification according to the scale outlines in Table 1 below. Skin reactions matching a score of 3 will be evaluated with a second clinic visit between 2 to 7 days after initial application. Any skin reactions of score 4 or 5 at final assessment will be deemed to be positive for allergic contact dermatitis, and patients will be deemed positive for allergic contact dermatitis.

Treatment of localized forms relies on adequate surgery without tumor spillage and sometimes systemic treatment with imatinib according to risk of relapse defined by localization, tumor size and mitotic count, as well as mutational status. More than 40% of cases may recur and metastasize. Advanced and relapsing forms are currently treated with oral tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) of KIT and PDGFR such as imatinib (standard treatment), sunitinib (2nd line) and regorafenib (3rd line). Nevertheless, imatinib has little or no activity in patients harboring the D842V mutation in the exon 18 of PDGFRα (20% of gastric GIST, 6% of all GIST patients). Consequently, other therapeutic alternatives are needed.

Results from the phase I single-arm NAVIGATOR study show that avapritinib has significant efficacy in GIST patients with PDGFRα D842V mutation (ORR = 86 %). In France, an authorization for temporary use (ATUc) starting on September 21st, 2020 has been granted by the National Agency for Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM). It allows the early availability of avapritinib in France while waiting for Market Authorization Approval (AMM). This ATUc is now being followed by a post-ATU period.

The objective of this real-life registry is to perform a long-term longitudinal follow up of PDGFRA D842V-mutated GIST patients and to collect effectiveness and safety data. It will be implemented in parallel to the post-ATUc period until June 2023.

Moreover, this registry fulfills the HAS's (""Haute Autorité de Santé"") request regarding the Establishment of an exhaustive registry of patients with GIST, harboring the D842V / PDGFRA mutation in France. This registry will specifically describe:

CLINMIR Pilot Protocol","Cancer is one of the main causes of death globally, being in many countries the first cause of mortality. One of the main side effects of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment in cancer patients is the alteration of taste and smell, internationally known as these anomalies Taste Smell Alterations (TSA). These alterations are the result of an altered cellular structure, the presence of TSA is associated with reduced quality of life and poor nutrition, due to dietary changes made by these patients.

Synsepalum dulcidicum (dried miracle berry, DMB) is a plant belonging to the Sapotaceae family, made up of around 800 species grouped into around 40 genera. It is an indigenous species to the forest regions of West Africa. Nuts of this specie have been approved as a novel food in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/2238 and at the request of the European Commission through the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens. The characteristic component of DMB is miraculin. Miraculin is a glycoprotein whose consumption causes acidic and sour foods, and to a lesser extent bitter, to be perceived as having a sweet taste. In this sense, it is possible that the consumption of DMB before each meal can improve sensory perception after treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","Randomized, parallel, triple-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of habitual consumption of DMB on the olfactory-gustative perception in cancer patients with malnutrition.

30 volunteers will be recruited at the La Paz University Hospital of Madrid. Participants should meet the next inclusion criteria: men and women over 18, a weight loss \>=5 %, malnutrition, taste alterations, cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery, chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy who are not candidates for surgery, with less than or equal to one third of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment initially scheduled, a life expectancy greater than 3 months, oral intake of food and drinks, adequate cultural level and understanding of the clinical study.

Participants will be randomized in 3 arms:

NCT00842660,Radiotherapy With Single-Agent Cisplatin or Combination Chemotherapy in Defined Poor-Prognostic Cervical Cancer,Phase III Trial for Primary Radiotherapy With Single-Agent Cisplatin or Combination Chemotherapy in PET/CT Defined Poor-Prognostic Cervical Cancer Patients,"Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer. However, in patients with advanced cervical cancer, half of them treated with contemporary radiotherapy plus single agent cisplatin still suffered from the local or distant relapse. How to improve the treatment outcome of these patients is a very important issue and requires further clinical investigation.

The major aim of this project is to conduct a prospective, randomized phase III clinical trial to examine if cervical cancer patients treated by radiotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine have better survival rates than those treated by radiotherapy with cisplatin alone.

Gemcitabine has been demonstrated to be a good radiosensitizer. In keeping with this, few clinical trials in early phases showed promising results when using concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine. According to these positive results, the investigators expect this trial has the potential to improve the survival in patients with advanced cervical cancer, reduce the medical costs due to tumor relapse, and then benefit the whole society.","I).

NCT04879160,Systematically Assessing Changes in Plexiform Neurofibroma Related Disfigurement From Photographs of Subjects With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 on a Phase 2 Clinical Trial,Systematically Assessing Changes in Plexiform Neurofibroma Related Disfigurement From Photographs of Subjects With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 on a Phase 2 Clinical Trial,"Background:

People with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). PNs are tumors that form in the tissue. They can form anywhere in the body. They can become visible and cause deformations. Researchers want to see if selumetinib changes how PNs look in people with NF1. They also want to test a rating system for the visibility of these tumors.

Objective:

To see if treatment with selumetinib can improve the appearance of visible PNs in people with NF1, as determined by people who are/are not familiar with NF1.

Eligibility:

People with NF1 who have one or more visible PNs and have been enrolled in study 11C0161 or 08C0079. Clinicians and non-clinicians with and without experience in NF1 are also needed to serve as raters.

Design:

Participants are people with NF1 who had photos taken on study 11C0161 or 08C0079. Raters are people who will evaluate the PNs in the photos. They will rate the tumors on a scale from 1 to 10, from less to most visible.

Participants medical records will be reviewed. Their photos will be shown to 28 raters.

Raters will fill out a survey about their demographics, place of work, and if they are familiar with NF1. They will view sample photos to learn how PNs look and how to rate PNs.

Raters will view photos of PNs taken before and after selumetinib treatment. They will also view photos of PNs that were not treated. They will rate PNs for up to 40 participants. They will have 1-2 sessions. Each session will last 1 hour....","Background:

Up to 50% of subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) will develop histologically benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN).

One of the most common morbidities associated with PN is a disfigurement that has the potential to pose formidable obstacles to the medical and psychosocial well-being of subjects with NF1.

The phase 2 trial of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib for inoperable PN (NCT01362803) have shown volumetric shrinkage of PN in approximately 74% of subjects with at least one PN morbidity, with most of the responsive tumors decreasing in size by 20-50% volume from baseline. Both trials have completed enrollment and primary study objectives.

In this selumetinib trial, standardized photography of visible PN was performed over time to assess for changes in disfigurement over time. This trial did not include criteria to measure changes in disfigurement and no validated criteria for measurement of PN-related disfigurement exist.

We developed a scale to rate the extent of a disfigurement from NF1 PN and will apply this scale to photographs obtained on the phase II selumetinib trial.

Objective:

To determine if selumetinib treatment is associated with improvement in PN-related disfigurement, as determined by raters reviewing photographs before treatment and just prior to cycle 13 of treatment.

Eligibility:

Four groups of adult raters to rate disfigurement who are not directly involved in the conduct of the selumetinib treatment study (NCT01362803), who are not NIH employees, and can read and write in English.

Design:

-Methods

Photographs of consenting individuals with PN, who may or may not have received selumetinib will be reviewed.

Raters will be presented pre and post treatment photographs of persons who received selumetinib as well as control photographs of persons not receiving selumetinib.

Each rater is presented with the same set of photographs though placement and order may differ.

Each rater will look at photographs of each individual with PN for at least 10 seconds, then with photos still visible, raters will verbally answer a questionnaire.

The rater will be asked questions at the end of the session to assess the feasibility of the questionnaire.

Session will be repeated by some raters approximately six months later on a subset of the photographs.

-Statistical Analysis

In each cohort of raters, for each subject s slide set evaluated at a time point, the mean of the raters scores for each subject will be formed.

For each person with PN that received selumetinib, the paired difference between baseline and pre-cycle 13 of these mean scores will be determined.

For the full set of approximately 35 paired scores, the difference will be assessed for statistical importance by means of a paired t-test, or a Wilcoxon signed rank test.",COMPLETED,,2021-05-12,2022-08-15,2022-08-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,52,ACTUAL
NCT05978960,EXERT-BCN: an Exercise and Nutrition Regimen to Designed to Improve Body Composition After Treatment for Breast Cancer,"An EXErcise Regimen Designed to Improve Body Composition, Functional Capacity, and Strength After Treatment for Breast Cancer with Nutrition Optimization","This protocol seeks to analyze patient outcomes of the standard of care, monitored group exercise regimen of high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements in conjunction with a nutrition regimen focused on food quality under close supervision on women who have been treated for breast cancer.","Excess adipose tissue is a risk factor for the diagnosis of breast cancer and is also associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence.1 Additionally weight gain during and after treatment for breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of recurrence, distant metastases, and death.2 More specifically, low muscle mass and increased adipose tissue is associated with poorer outcomes after the treatment of breast cancer.3 Yet, most women gain significant weight during and after breast cancer treatment, potentially compromising outcomes.

Effective methods to promote weight loss and improve metabolic and hormonal dysregulation, inflammation, and body composition in the breast cancer setting are urgently needed. In the noncancer setting, the promotion of high-quality diets that avoided processed food and simple carbohydrates in the DIETFITS study promoted weight loss4. However, this dietary strategy and others were utilized to result in weight loss, but do not necessarily consider maximizing body composition, i.e., muscle mass preservation or increase, and adipose tissue loss.

The major, and some would consider only, non-pharmacological method to increase muscle mass is via resistance training with an adequate stimulus and quantity to elicit and promote hypertrophy.5 Our group has already shown that profound muscle hypertrophy is attainable in a population of women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, particularly when the dose threshold of load and repetitions is met. At interim analysis, this program revealed a 2 lb. increase in muscle mass and a 6 lb. decrease in adipose tissue after a 3 month program utilizing linear progression.

Based on the DIEFITS protocol which has been described as a ""healthy low-carbohydrate"" diet, participants will be advised to eat nutrient dense food sources high in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Participants will be told to limit processed foods, sugar, bread, pasta, and other simple carbohydrates. Participants will be advised to eat plenty of colorful and nonstarchy vegetables. Finally, participants will be told to avoid snacking between meals, cook most/all meals, eat with family and friends, avoid eating food in the car or on the run, and focus on whole foods that require preparation. This protocol resulted in significant weight loss at one year. Additionally, the lack of calculations and quantification of calories leaves this as a more user-friendly option for participants.

The exercise regimen from EXERT-BC has yet to be combined with a dietary intervention. Thus, the following protocol will assess our resistance training regimen in conjunction with a nutrition intervention similar to the DIETFITS Protocol. This will allow adequate assessment of whether we can optimize body composition in these individuals with both exercise and dietary changes.",COMPLETED,,2023-05-20,2024-09-19,2024-07-04,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,44,ACTUAL
NCT05939960,Application of a New Type of Whole Blood Coagulation Time Measurement in Evaluating the Hypercoagulable State of Malignant Tumors,Application of a New Type of Whole Blood Coagulation Time Measurement in Evaluating the Hypercoagulable State of Malignant Tumors,"Malignant tumors are closely related to deep vein thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism and other diseases. Tumor patients usually have a hypercoagulable state (HCS) in their blood, and the proportion of thrombosis caused by HCS is more than 10 times that of non tumor patients. Conventional clinical testing methods such as coagulation function, blood routine, and thromboelastography are difficult to directly evaluate the hypercoagulable state of tumor patients. In addition, the widely used Khorana score and Caprini score systems in clinical practice need to be improved in accurately reflecting the hypercoagulable state of tumor patients.

Our team has established a complete new coagulation time measurement system, including general clotting time (GCT), platelet rich plasma clotting time (PRP-CT), and platelet poor plasma clotting time (PPP-CT), which may be a new and accurate method for evaluating tumor hypercoagulability.

The GCT study aims to evaluate: 1. The time of GCT, PRP-CT, and PPP-CT for malignant tumors is shorter than that of normal individuals, and some patients are in a hypercoagulable state; 2. The shortened time of GCT, PRP-CT, and PPP-CT may be associated with future thrombosis; 3. Evaluating the relationship between shortened GCT system time and overall tumor survival

Therefore, the GCT system evaluation may identify patients who are truly in a hypercoagulable state, providing monitoring indicators for subsequent anticoagulation; It can also be evaluated whether GCT time can reflect the prognosis of tumor patients.",,UNKNOWN,,2023-07-01,2024-09-30,2024-02-28,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,354,ESTIMATED

Homeopathy involves treatment of patients with diluted natural substances aimed at stimulating the body's healing system. In the efficacy trial literature, individualized homeopathy shows the most promise over other forms of homeopathic intervention. Individualized homeopathic treatment involves a unique yet established method of case taking. During the consultation, the homeopath asks a series of broad questions to elicit subjective symptoms related to the patient's disease, their medical history, as well as particular characteristics (physical or psychological) related to the individual. This study will recruit children receiving chemotherapy to undergo homeopathic remedies to treat their fatigue. This study hypothesizes that homeopathic treatment will effectively treat fatigue.",,COMPLETED,,2012-08,2014-05,2014-05,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,,9,ACTUAL
NCT00651976,"Letrozole in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Stage I, II or III Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery",Pre-Surgical Trial of Letrozole in Post-Menopausal Patients With Operable Hormone-Sensitive Breast Cancer (Spore),"RATIONALE: Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Giving letrozole before surgery allows us to monitor the effects of letrozole on the tumor on a molecular level and determine markers of response to treatment.

PURPOSE: This study will show us how well letrozole works in treating postmenopausal women with stage I, II or III breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary To determine that in breast tumors that continue to exhibit high proliferation (i.e., Ki67) upon hormone deprivation (with letrozole), their gene expression and/or a mutational or proteomic signatures will harbor molecules or 'pathways' that are biomarkers of resistance to endocrine therapy or a cause of it.

The ultimate goal of these aims is to identify clinically-targetable pathways which can be exploited to enhance responses and survival in patients with ER+ breast cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 7-21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24 hours after the last dose of letrozole, patients undergo total mastectomy or segmental resection with lymph node evaluation.

Pre-treatment diagnostic breast tissue is obtained. Patients undergo treatment and then undergo standard of care mastectomy or lumpectomy. Pre and post treatment tumor tissue samples are analyzed for Ki67, P-ER, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and caspase 3 by immunohistochemistry; and RNA microarray.",TERMINATED,funding unavailable,2008-03,2018-09,2018-09,INTERVENTIONAL,EARLY_PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,213,ACTUAL
NCT05987176,Comparison of Adjuvant Treatment With 177Lu-DOTATATE to Best Supportive Care in Patients After Resection of Neuroendocrine Liver Metastases,An International Multicentre Randomized Unblinded Phase II Study Comparing Adjuvant Treatment With 177Lu-DOTATATE (Lutathera®) to Best Supportive Care in Patients After Resection of Neuroendocrine Liver Metastases,"An international multi-centre, open, randomised, parallel-group phase II study comparing adjuvant treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE to best supportive care in patients after complete surgical removal of neuroendocrine liver metastases.

In this study, adjuvant treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE will be compared with best supportive care in patients with well differentiated grade 1 or 2 neuroendocrine tumours in the stomach, pancreas or gut (gastro-entero-pancreatic NETs) who had their primary tumour already removed or in whom both primary and liver tumour metastases removal will take place simultaneously, including removal of perihilar lymph nodes will be eligible.

The primary objective is to compare overall disease-free survival at 3 years after treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE to best supportive care between both treatment arms, with equal chances of entering either arm (1:1)

Secondary objectives are to describe and compare the difference in disease-free survival in the liver, overall survival, time to the next anticancer treatment, the cost effectiveness and health-related quality of life. The safety and toxicity of 177Lu-DOTATATE as adjuvant therapy will also be described.

Additionally, the clinical use of blood and urine analysis test (NETest) will be evaluated to identify microscopic remaining disease and detect early the return of the tumour.","There will be 2 arms: arm A consisting of best supportive care and arm B, the experimental treatment. Randomisation will be 1:1 as soon as possible after the liver surgery.

The control arm will consist of standard of care. The study will be embedded within the regular clinical pathway for treatment and follow-up of patients with resectable NE LM. The follow-up will be according to current guidelines (e.g., Guidelines of the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society for the management of advanced intestinal NET and pancreatic NET with locoregional and/or distant metastases). Patients will be followed up in the study for 3 years according to standard post-surgical follow-up protocol and thereafter in their local institution life-long according to follow-up after liver resection for NE LM.

In the treatment arm 177Lu-DOTATATE will be applied. The first cycle will be applied 6±2 weeks after liver resection. The frequency of administration will be 2 cycles (8±1weeks between each cycle). The rationale for 2 cycles in the adjuvant setting instead of 4 (as per standard protocol in palliative setting), assumes that after the removal of the primary tumour and the liver metastases, there will be no macroscopic residual tumour. Thus, the treatment dose should be sufficient to target microscopic disease and have the smallest possible effect on healthy tissue.

In the treatment arm, the patients will have 10 study visits for post -PRRT monitoring (blood tests and clinical assessments). Patients in the standard of care arm will have visits every 3 months. In both arms, patients will have one screening visit and one end of study visit. They will complete QoL questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up visits at 12, 24, and 36 months and bloods/urine will be collected for translational research prior to surgery (while in hospital) and at 6, 12, and 36 months.

Signature of informed consent precedes all study-specific assessments. All patients will have a fresh tumour sample collected during the liver surgery. Disease recurrence will be measured in all patients using liver MRIs every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for the second to third year and 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET CT every 12 months for 3 years. Any patient with disease recurrence ceases treatment and assessments and will proceed to standard of care treatment for recurrent liver metastases.

Follow-up data will be collected for 5 years overall from the date of randomisation of the last patient.",RECRUITING,,2024-08-02,2029-03-30,2028-09-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,106,ESTIMATED

Niraparib has received approval independent from HR status. Although the benefit is more remarkable in HR-deficient patients, there is no biomarker to predict sustained response to niraparib at the start of treatment helping the clinician to make decisions among the different treatment options.

The aim of the LIBINI-1 (Liquid biopsy for predicting niraparib benefit if 1st line) study is to identify predictive biomarkers of sustained response to niraparib using liquid biopsy with two different technologies:

1. Proteomic and secretome analysis tools. The first part of the LIBINI-1 project is to create a platform for rapid screening and analysis by multiple detections of niraparib response-associated proteins in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
2. ctDNA analysis. The second part of the LIBINI-1 project is to correlate the baseline level of ctDNA and change in ctDNA at 4 and 12 weeks with the benefit to niraparib.","The main objective of this study (LIBINI-1 first part) is characterizing liquid biopsy profiles of ovarian cancer patients with sustained niraparib benefit as maintenance in the first line through proteomic and secretome analysis. The first part of LIBINI-1 is addressed by four individual subsequent objectives (see ANNEX 2).

Therefore, the primary objective is the development of a panel for multiplex detection of proteins associated with sustained benefit from niraparib maintenance.

For the execution of the primary objective the following consecutive secondary objectives are planned:

1. Global characterization of proteins (proteome) in plasma samples from patients with and without benefit from niraparib maintenance. Identification of molecular pathways of proteins differentially expressed between both groups.
2. Analysis of secreted proteins (secretome) in plasma samples of patients with and without benefit from niraparib maintenance.

3 \& 4: Development of customized panels for multiplex detection of proteins associated with sustained benefit from niraparib maintenance.

After this discovery phase, the predictive panel should be validated in a confirmatory study with a larger cohort of advanced ovarian cancer patient samples.

The second part of LINIBI-1 is to correlate the baseline levels of ctDNA and the changes in ctDNA at 4 and 12 weeks (3 months) with benefit to niraparib. This second part of LIBINI-I will be analyzed in a subsequent study.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2025-07-25,2028-03-31,2027-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,120,ESTIMATED

Unfortunately, many patients fail to derive benefit from this treatment. No clinical or molecular marker has been established to predict benefit from gemcitabine therapy, so patients are treated empirically until evidence of disease progression or worsening performance status.

The potential for human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) expression to predict survival in gemcitabine-treated patients has been studied, and data suggest that patients with low levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression derive less benefit from gemcitabine treatment than patients with high levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression. Furthermore, the PK profiles of CO-1.01 and gemcitabine are different, and this may also favorably influence the in vivo antiproliferative effects of CO-1.01. These data support the hypothesis that patients expressing low levels of hENT1 will derive minimal benefit from gemcitabine, but will receive benefit from CO-1.01 (gemcitabine elaidate) which enters tumor cells in a hENT1-independent fashion.

The formulation of CO-1.01 that is currently used in clinical studies contains 15 mg/mL of gemcitabine-5'-elaidate solubilized in purified phospholipids.

NCT06485076,Early Palliative Care for Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Aggressive Lymphoma,Phase II Feasibility Study of Early Palliative Care for Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Aggressive Lymphoma,"Patients with multiple myeloma experience a wide range of physical and psychological symptoms from the time of their diagnosis. Meanwhile, patients with aggressive lymphomas undergo unpredictable illness courses, resulting in goals of care conversations occurring late in the illness trajectory and aggressive care being received in the last 30 days of life. Early palliative care alongside usual cancer care has been shown to improve patient outcomes such as symptom burden, mood, and quality of life in patients with solid tumours (e.g. lung, breast or gynecological cancers), but has not been explored among patients with blood cancers to date.

The goal of this clinical trial is to a brief early palliative care intervention for patients with multiple myeloma and aggressive B cell lymphoma attending the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. The main goals of the study are:

* To see if it is possible to apply the early palliative care intervention for patients with multiple myeloma and aggressive lymphoma
* To see if this early palliative care intervention works well for these patients
* To compare patient experiences with early palliative care and usual care.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will receive early palliative care in addition to usual care from their blood cancer doctor, and the other group will receive usual care from their blood cancer doctor only. All participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires about their symptom burden, mood, quality of life, and satisfaction with care throughout the study. Some participants will also be asked to take part in interviews at the end of the trial to answer questions about their experience taking part in the study. Researchers will compare the results between the two groups to see if there are any improvements in quality of life for the patients who received early palliative care. The researchers will use the results of this study to guide in the development of a larger clinical trial.","In this study, the investigators will test an early palliative care intervention for patients with multiple myeloma and aggressive B cell lymphoma in a randomized phase II trial in which outpatients with multiple myeloma and aggressive lymphoma will be allocated to one of two groups: symptom screening alone (usual care) or early palliative care (intervention).

Currently, once prostate cancer cells have spread from the prostate to other organs it is not treatable by surgery. The purpose of this study is to treat patients with an experimental antibody (i.e. that has not been FDA approved) called J591 that attaches itself to a special protein on cancer cells called PSMA to try to eliminate these cancer cells (called circulating tumor cells) from the circulation.

In the initial phase of the study, 6 participants will receive the experimental J591 treatment. Routine blood tests, research blood tests, physical exam will be performed at each visit. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about how they are feeling. Participants will have a radiographic scan every 3 months to check the status of their disease.

Participants who tolerate the treatment well may be re-treated at the same level every 3 months, and may continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects.","J591 is a de-immunized monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Background data demonstrate that mAb Hu-J591 doses as low as 20 mg may lead to a decrease in CTCs and that doses up to 300 mg are safe. With a goal of establishing less frequent, potentially more convenient and cost-effective future therapy, the investigators propose a single-center, open-label, dose de-escalation study to determine the effect of mAb Hu-J591 on circulating tumor cells in subjects with metastatic PC. Four dose levels are planned with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 24 subject enrollment starting with a single infusion of 300 mg of mAb Hu-J591.

In the initial phase of the study a cohort of 6 subjects will receive 300 mg of mAb Hu-J591 and blood samples will be collected pre and post-infusion for the detection of CTCs, PSA and to assess hematological toxicity at screening, baseline, week 1, week 4, week 8, and week 12.

If less than four subjects respond by dropping their CTC counts from more than or equal to 5 CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood to less than 5 CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood in the initial cohort, the trial will be ended at this dose. If four or more subjects respond, an additional 6 subjects will be accrued to the second dose level (200 mg). The same decision rule will be applied to evaluate two additional lower dose levels (100 mg, 50 mg) with 6 subjects enrolled in each cohort. Imaging studies will be performed prior to treatment at screening and at 3 months or as clinically indicated to assess disease response.

NCT05148494,TES RCT Fleet Enema vs Oral Mechanical Bowel Prep,Transanal Endoscopic Surgery: a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Fleet Enema vs Oral Mechanical Bowel Prep (TESEO Trial),"There is no consensus about the best bowel preparation prior to transanal endoscopic surgery TES). Cleanliness and visibility in the rectosigmoid and rectum are of utmost importance, possibly even more so than during colonoscopy, to facilitate safe, precise and efficient resection of the rectal lesion and potentially adequate closure of the defect. Both Fleet enemas and oral mechanical bowel preparation are considered standard of care in preparation for TES. This single center two arm single blinded randomized controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of Fleet enemas in comparison to Pico Salax oral mechanical bowel preparation in cleansing the rectum as measured by a modified version of the Ottawa Bowel Prep Scale.","Oral mechanical bowel preparation with Pico Salax (picosulfate sodium, magnesium oxide, and citric acid) or alternative is considered a standard modality for cleansing the entire colon prior to colonoscopy or surgical procedures. Fleet enemas are sodium phosphate-based laxatives in the form of a liquid inserted rectally, which are also very effective at evacuating the solid stool from the sigmoid and rectum in preparation for procedures such as flexible sigmoidoscopy or anoscopy, which only require visualization of the distal colon and rectum. Commonly, endoscopists use the well validated bowel preparation scores such as the Boston Bowel Prep Score, Aronchick Scale or the Ottawa Bowel Prep Scale when evaluating the effectiveness of such bowel preparation regimens at clearing away all debris and opaque liquid from the colon. Few studies have been performed to evaluate whether an oral mechanical bowel preparation or a rectal application by means of fleet enemas or alternatives gives better visibility or is preferred by the patient. A randomized controlled trial comparing two fleet enemas with an oral preparation that consisted of magnesium citrate and two Dulcolax tablets for flexible sigmoidoscopy, were able to show that patient acceptance, encounter time, technical ease, quality of colon preparation was significantly better with the oral form of colon preparation than with standard fleet enemas. On the other hand, another randomized controlled trial were able to show that fleet enemas were superior to picosulfate based oral bowel preparation for flexible sigmoidoscopy while also showing a decreased incidence of associated adverse symptoms, and better patient tolerance. Conflicting studies exist. Both bowel regimens are considered standard of care in preparation for surgery of the sigmoid and rectum. Fleet enemas seem to be the preparation most commonly used for flexible sigmoidoscopy.

Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) is a minimally invasive technique used to perform full thickness excisions of rectal lesions (benign and malignant) with precision, allowing access to lesions in the rectum as high as 22 cm from the anus. The technique can be performed using either the rigid transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) platform or the flexible port termed transanal endoscopic minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS). The technique decreases risk of positive margins and local recurrence in comparison to standard local excision techniques in the operating room. It is the preferred method of local excision of rectal lesions. As with polyp detection and removal during flexible sigmoidoscopy, TES for rectal neoplasms requires excellent visibility and minimization of debris in order to be able to perform the precise excision of the lesion and help facilitate closure of the full thickness defect in the rectal wall. TES is performed globally with no consensus about the optimal bowel preparation regimen for achieving visibility and facilitating the easiest, most efficient and safest dissection.

Objectives:

The primary objective of this study is to determine whether oral Pico Salax bowel preparation regimen achieves a higher score on the Ottawa Bowel Prep Scale specifically for the rectosigmoid segment in comparison to 2 fleet enemas during TES.

The secondary objectives include validation of the Ottawa Bowel Prep Scale specifically for use with fleet enemas or Pico Salax for the rectosigmoid segment during TES; determining if there are differences in length of time spent cleaning the operative field by the surgeon; the ability to close the defect; post-operative short-term complications, and patient tolerability of the preparation.

This study will serve as a pilot study for a potentially larger multi-center pan Canadian RCT. The TEMPEST group is a collaboration of TES trained surgeons across Canada at tertiary care teaching hospitals, involved in research collaborations. The results of this study will be used to see if randomization to two different bowel regimens in this very select group of patients undergoing trans-anal surgery is feasible and can yield informative data. The study will be powered for the primary objective, but we will be collecting data on numerous secondary objectives which may show important trends. If the study proves to be feasible, the next step would be to expand the study to several other centers across Canada as part of the TEMPEST collaborative, in order to collect much larger datasets and the power to look much more closely at not only the primary objective but also the secondary objectives.",RECRUITING,,2022-03-16,2026-10-01,2026-08-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,66,ESTIMATED

Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of thiotepa in combination with carboplatin and topotecan with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with recurrent or refractory pediatric solid tumors.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of thiotepa.

Patients may receive 2 courses of mobilization comprising cyclophosphamide and etoposide with filgrastim (G-CSF) support and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection.

Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days 0 and 1; topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 0-4; and carboplatin IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3. Patients also receive G-CSF beginning on day 5, 24-36 hours following the last dose of topotecan. PBSC are reinfused on day 6 (36-48 hours following the last dose of topotecan) of each course of therapy. Patients receive 3 courses of therapy.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of thiotepa until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed at 1 and 2 years.

NCT05655494,A Multilevel Approach to Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials,Precision Clinical Trial Recruitment to Promote Cancer Health Equity Across Florida,The purpose of this study is to pilot test and evaluate an existing tailored ALEX Research Portal to navigate Black and Hispanic adult cancer patients and their family members through referral to cancer clinical trials.,"Racial and ethnic minorities represent the fastest growing segment of the United States adult population, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Low trust in clinical research and recruitment approaches that fail to address multilevel barriers to CCT participation are key reasons for minority population underrepresentation. Community health educators (CHEs) improve trust in research among underrepresented populations, yet relying on exclusively on CHE availability can limit intervention reach. Virtual CHEs (vCHEs) improve scalability by extending CHE capabilities and capitalizing on remote recruitment techniques.The purpose of the current project is to increase referral of diverse participants to NCI-supported clinical trials via a culturally responsive, multi-level intervention that utilizes vCHEs to reach diverse populations. We will consolidate existing referral channels within the ALEX Research Portal. ALEX offers a custom experience for clinicians, CHEs, and patients to facilitate CCT referrals. Clinicians can utilize the portal to refer to CCTs; CHEs can use the portal to create an avatar that can provide introductory information to patients and schedule video-conference follow-ups; patients, families, and community members can use the portal to easily navigate to key information and make self-and other-referrals. The ability to streamline information to patients and CCT referrals to study coordinators is expected to improve the overall referral to CCTs. The ALEX Research Portal utilizes the adaptive virtual human technology developed at the University of Florida that provides users with culturally and linguistically tailored CCT information. The ALEX Research Portal will be developed and launched across three distinct geographic areas of Florida (Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Miami). This unique collaborative opportunity will provide access to participants representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the state as well as cancer centers conducting CCTs associated with national networks (ETCTN, NCTN). Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation, our goal is to increase referrals to CCTs by optimizing the ALEX Research Portal for broad use. The outcome will be an evidence-based intervention that can be widely disseminated to quickly increase the referral of diverse patients to CCTs. This project will be conducted in three phases: (Phase I) establish a baseline of referrals and accrual of diverse participants to CCTs across multiple Florida Center Centers, (Phase 2) adapt and pilot the ALEX Research Portal using a randomized controlled clinical trial, and (Phase 3) scale the intervention by dissemination via the OneFlorida network. The proposed study will result in an empirically-tested vCHE Research Portal for increasing trust in CCTs among diverse populations that can easily be adapted and disseminated across the state to overcome challenges associated with recruiting diverse participants to CCTs.",RECRUITING,,2025-05-20,2027-08-31,2027-08-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,OTHER,350,ESTIMATED

Typically drug-related cancer care is conducted at a medical center which causes patients to have to spend considerable time away from family, friends, and familiar surroundings. This separation may add to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families during this difficult time in their lives. Therapy administered to a patient in the patients' residence in the comfort of familiar surrounding using Cancer Connected Access and Remote Expertise (CARE) Beyond Walls (CCBW) may help reduce psychological and financial distress, increase access to care and improve treatment compliance. Giving cancer therapy in the home compared in the clinic may be safe, tolerable and improve patient satisfaction with overall cancer care in Black men with locally advanced, biochemically recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To establish patient-centeredness by comparing patient ratings of their overall cancer care experience in the clinic versus in the home.

II. To establish patient-centeredness by evaluating patient preferences regarding the location of cancer treatment delivery.

SAFETY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety of home administered intravenous (IV)/subcutaneous (SQ) drug treatment by a home health provider with remote patient monitoring and Command Center support as measured by the incidence of grade 3+ adverse events at least possibly related to cancer treatment delivery.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Palliative radiation therapy, such as external beam radiation therapy, uses high energy beams to treat symptoms that are caused by tumors. Giving pembrolizumab together with palliative radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with esophagus, stomach, or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To establish that the combination of pembrolizumab and traditional external beam multifractionated radiation therapy (RT) to the primary tumor or a single target metastatic site of patients with metastatic gastric, esophageal, and/or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers will lead to an increase in tumor infiltrating cytotoxic T-cells and circulating cytotoxic T cells and a reduction in immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in metastatic sites.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To establish that the combination of pembrolizumab and RT is feasible in the patient population and evaluate toxicities per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (ver.) 4.03.

II. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune related (ir)RECIST in this treatment population and correlate with tumor T-cell response.

III. To evaluate progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this treatment population.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To measure changes in whole genome serum micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) signature before and after protocol therapy and correlate with tumor/immune/stromal cell miRNA expression profiling determined by deep sequencing.

II. To measures changes in fecal and oral microbiomic diversity and correlative with ORR, PFS, and OS.

III. To assess germline mutations in a panel of miRNA regulatory genes using the MiraDx assay as predictors of response and toxicity to pembrolizumab and RT.

NCT00432094,Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant for Germ Cell Tumors,Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant for Germ Cell Tumors,"RATIONALE: Germ cell tumors (GCT) are highly sensitive to chemotherapy such that even with metastatic disease at diagnosis, many patients can be cured. Patients who fall into the poor risk category or others who relapse can be successfully salvaged with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (AuSCT). As in other diseases such as myeloma, sequential high dose chemotherapy and AuSCT may improve overall and disease free survival.

PURPOSE: Because prior investigations in GCT suggest that a subset of high risk or relapsed patients may be cured with sequential cycles of high dose chemotherapy and AuSCT, we propose investigating how well non-cross resistant conditioning regimens work in treating patients with relapsed or high risk GCT.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine overall survival (OS) of patients with germ cell tumors treated with tandem autologous stem cell transplantation with non-cross-resistant conditioning regimens.

Secondary

* Determine disease-free survival (DFS) of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of tandem transplants
* Determine the time to engraftment of neutrophils and platelets in patients treated for each transplant
* Determine the number of patients unable to adequately mobilize sufficient peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for tandem transplantation.
* Identify prognostic factors of patients unlikely to mobilize sufficient PBSC for tandem transplantation.
* Compare OS and DFS of patients undergoing single vs tandem transplantation.

OUTLINE:

* Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF): Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 1 and continuing until stem cell collection is complete. Patients undergo stem cell collection beginning on day 5 of G-CSF administration and continuing for at least 3 collections until the collection goal is met.
* Second PBSC mobilization with chemotherapy: Patients not meeting the collection goal receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 1 and G-CSF SC beginning on day 4 and continuing until stem cell collection is complete. Patients meeting the collection goal after PBSC mobilization via G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy will undergo tandem autologous transplantation. If collection goal is not met but the patient has collected \> or = 2 x 10\^6 CD34 cells/kg, a single autologous transplant will be performed.
* Single stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day -7 and ifosfamide IV on days -6 to -4. Patients undergo reinfusion of stem cells on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.
* Tandem SCT: Patients receive treatment as in single SCT. Beginning 30-90 days later, patients receive carboplatin IV over 60 minutes and thiotepa IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -4 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -3. Patients undergo reinfusion of stem cells on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6, 9, and 12 months and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.

The clinical trial is designed to evaluate the possible enhanced antitumor activity of CV301 with Anti-PD1-Therapy. The rationale for combining CV301 with Anti-PD1-Therapy is based on the hypothesis that CV301 can induce specific immune response in the tumor, and that in combination, Anti-PD1-Therapy may augment the T cell-mediated immune response generated by CV301 by blocking the inhibitory signal of the PD-1.

The trial will include a Phase 1 portion and a Phase 1b portion with 2 cohorts. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation part to assess the safety and tolerability of CV301 alone, prior to moving into the combination with Anti-PD1-Therapy (the Phase 1b component).

The following Phase 1b portion of the trial aims to test the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment using a two cohort approach with cohort 1 receiving CV301 plus Nivolumab and cohort 2 receiving CV301 plus Pembrolizumab.",,COMPLETED,,2016-12,2020-01,2020-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,24,ACTUAL

NCT05677594,Multi-parametric Biomarker Development to Predict Malignant Conversion in Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1,Multi-parametric Biomarker Development to Predict Malignant Conversion in Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1,"The goal of this prospective observational study is to learn about the utility of imaging and clinical features in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 categorized as high risk for the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

The main objectives are:

* To evaluate the prevalence, multi-parametric imaging features of distinct nodular lesions (""DNLs"") and natural history in people with NF1 with clinical and genetic features deemed ""high-risk"" for malignancy.
* To assess the relationship between individual clinical, genetic and imaging factors that have been suggested to be risk factors for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) and the confirmation of atypical neurofibromas (aNF)/ atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm of unknown biologic potential (ANNUBP) or MPNST on pathology.

In this research study, the participants will be asked to undergo whole body MRI, provide blood sample and clinical evaluation annually.","Patients with the autosomal dominant genetic tumor predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing both benign and malignant neoplasms throughout life. The most common tumors are peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) such as plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs). pNFs are multicellular primary tumors of the peripheral nerve that are histologically benign but often cause significant neurologic morbidity due to involvement of critical nerves. However, the greatest fear is the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). MPNST is an aggressive, treatment resistant sarcoma with a 5-year survival rate of only 15-50% and is the leading cause of death in NF1 patients, especially in those under 50 years of age. An estimated 50% of NF1 patients develop pNFs and the lifetime risk of developing MPNST is 8-13%. The only possible cure for MPNST is complete resection with wide negative margins. This is only feasible if the lesion can be clearly defined and removed without life-threatening morbidity. A major challenge to clearly differentiating between MPNSTs and pNFs is that the vast majority of MPNSTs arise within pNFs. This intimate association makes it hard to distinguish MPNST clinically, radiologically, and pathologically from surrounding benign tissue, thus leading to delayed diagnosis until after symptoms (such as severe pain and loss of neurologic function) have emerged and the chance for cure is greatly diminished or lost. A great deal of time, resource and worry from patients, the patients loved ones and medical providers is dedicated to detecting MPNSTs early at great expense and unclear benefit.

Existing clinical factors and imaging markers of MPNST do not accurately identify patients at risk of developing either MPNST or the patients precursor tumors. Retrospective studies from various centers have suggested several clinical factors associated with the development of MPNST including: number and volume of internal PNSTs, presence of subcutaneous neurofibromas, younger age, presence of pain, microdeletion of the NF1 gene, family and personal history of MPNST, and presence of atypical neurofibromas (aNF)/ANNUBPs. None of the imaging diagnostic tools studied in NF1 patients have been prospectively assessed to identify aNF/ANNUBP. Natural history studies and clinical trials using MRI have identified nodular target lesions within pre-existing pNFs on standard anatomic MRI as potential precursor lesions to MPNST that may represent aNF/ANNUBP. These lesions have been coined ""distinct nodular lesions"" (DNLs) and described as greater than 3 cm in largest diameter, well demarcated, distinct from the patients underlying tissue (i.e. the surrounding pNF), and lacking the target sign typical of benign pNFs (defined as a central hypointense region on T2-weighted images). In a recent retrospective review of 76 histologically confirmed aNFs, all aNFs fulfilled the criteria for DNLs on MRI and 50 of 56 aNFs with available 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission testing computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) demonstrated elevated maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) (\>3.5), supporting the hypothesis that DNLs may be the imaging correlate of pre-malignant tumors.

The investigators hypothesize that NF1 patients with aNF/ANNUBP represent a subset of individuals who have not developed cancer yet but who are at high risk of developing a malignancy, possibly in the short term. the investigators further hypothesize that a subset of DNLs are imaging correlates of aNF/ANNUBP that can be characterized with advanced imaging techniques such as Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and 18F-FDG PET/CT. Imaging identification of ANNUBPs and characterization of DNLs will enable early diagnosis and management of lesions destined to become malignant, thereby potentially dramatically improving outcomes for People with NF1 at highest risk for development of MPNST.

Defining the prevalence of DNL in a population clinically to be at high-risk for future development of malignancy, the behavior of DNLs over time and the multi-parametric imaging features of DNLs will allow the generation of imaging markers to: (1) identify the specific lesions at highest risk for malignancy in a sea of lesions, (2) understand the biologic significance of these lesions and, (3) create the data about the optimal imaging marker for these lesions to inform evidence based guidelines for imaging in people with NF1.

2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives):

* To evaluate the prevalence, multi-parametric imaging features of distinct nodular lesions ""DNLs"" and natural history in people with NF1 with clinical and genetic features deemed ""high-risk"" for malignancy.
* To assess the relationship between individual clinical, genetic and imaging factors that have been suggested to be risk factors for MPNST and the confirmation of aNF/ANNUBP or MPNST on pathology.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2021-07-01,2026-06-30,2026-06-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,80,ACTUAL

At the same time, patients with right-sided colon adenomas have a higher risk of developing interval cancers after endoscopic mucosal resection. Dysbiosis and known bacterial drivers play a significant role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer, and may contribute to the growth of adenomas. Clinical studies have found biofilm formation and positive staining for Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) in almost all right-sided colon cancers and adenomas. The composition of bacteria also in the normal mucosa in these two groups of patients has been found to be different from healthy controls.

Endoscopic preoperative antibiotic local treatment of the biofilm and tumors would theoretically result in decreased tumor mass, recovery of the mucosa, and a normalization of the immune response in the treated section of the colon. The oral administration of the antibiotic metronidazole in mice has shown to lower the tumor load (FN-positive xenograft tumors) and decrease in intratumoral abundance of the pro-carcinogenic bacteria, FN.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of local antibiotic treatment with fosfomycin and metronidazole on tumor characteristics and the colonic biofilm in patients with right-sided colon cancer or right-sided colon adenomas. This is a clinical proof-of-concept intervention study, and the investigators are to our knowledge the first group to look into local antibiotic treatment of biofilm in patients with colon cancer or colon adenoma. It is based on a non-randomized trial design with an open label single group assignment. There are two tracks depending on the pathology of the tumor: 1) patients with right-sided colon cancer; 2a) patients with right-sided colon adenoma. The intervention is a therapeutic endoscopy where the antibiotics fosfomycin and metronidazole are sprayed throughout the right colon section from caecum to the right colon flexure (100ml of gel contains 800mg of fosfomycin and 200mg of metronidazole). Patients will be included prospectively from the surgical department of Herlev University Hospital and Zealand University Hospital once having received oral and written information, followed by signing the consent. There will be a retrospective cohort of patients with colon adenoma from 2018 (track 2b). The investigators will retrieve the archived adenoma tissue as control tissue. In Clinical Trial, Track 1 and Track 2a will be registered as two different arms that use the same intervention, but the results from each arm later on is going to be reported in separate publications.","Background Dysbiosis and known bacterial drivers play a significant role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Among bacterial drivers, Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) and the formation of biofilm on the surface of the colonic epithelium are considered pro-carcinogenic. The increased permeability of the mucosal layer and the invading bacteria in the colonic crypts and submucosal space result in genetic and epigenetic changes along with immune responses that are all important oncogenic factors. Clinical studies have found biofilm formation and positive staining for FN in almost all right-sided colon cancers and adenomas. Two studies compared the bacterial growth in normal mucosa from patients with and without adenoma. They found a different composition of bacteria in the normal mucosa from patients with adenomas in terms of richness, diversity and bacterial strains, thus indicating that the bacterial composition in the gut could contribute to the growth of adenomas and subsequently, adenocarcinomas.

Endoscopic preoperative local antibiotic treatment of the biofilm and tumors would theoretically result in decreased tumor mass, recovery of the mucosal layer, and a normalization of the immune response in the treated section of the colon. The oral administration of the antibiotic metronidazole in mice has already been shown to decrease tumor growth (FN-positive xenograft tumors) as well as a decrease in intratumoral FN abundance.

Investigational Medicinal Products In this study a gel containing the antibiotics fosfomycin and metronidazole will be sprayed endoscopically on the mucosa of the right hemicolon. The gel will be prepared on site by combining solutions of fosfomycin and metronidazole with a gel-forming gum.

Study objectives The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of local antibiotic treatment with fosfomycin and metronidazole on tumor characteristics and the colonic biofilm in patients with right-sided colon cancer or right-sided colon adenomas.

Study design This study is a clinical proof-of-concept intervention study. It is based on a non-randomized trial design with an open label single group assignment. There are two tracks depending on the pathology of the tumor: track 1, patients with right-sided colon cancer; track 2a, patients with right-sided colon adenoma. The intervention is a therapeutic endoscopy where the antibiotics fosfomycin and metronidazole are sprayed throughout the right colon section from caecum to the right colon flexure in a gel-forming mixture. Patients will be included from the surgical department of Herlev Hospital and Zealand University Hospital. There will be a retrospective cohort of patient with colon adenoma, track 2b.

Effect parameters For patients with right-sided colonic carcinomas and/or adenomas, the investigators hypothesize that endoscopic, preoperative antibiotic treatment in the right colon with a gel-forming spray containing fosfomycin and metronidazole will result in normalization of the colonic epithelium and immune response as well as a reduction in colonic biofilm formation often seen in these patients.

Trial structure and responsibilities The principal investigator (Astrid Bennedsen) is responsible for the preparation of the protocol, the Case Report Forms (CRFs), coordinating any meetings of the safety data monitoring committee as well as implementing decisions in the daily operations of the trial. Along with a team of co-investigators, the principal investigator will do the screening, recruitment, data collection and writing of the CRFs. The safety data monitoring committee consists of three members and will be impartial. They will overview the progress and the safety of the trial. The meetings of the safety data monitoring committee will take place every six months, but an extra meeting will be held in case of any severe adverse events or any other serious incidents during the trial. The trial will be monitored by a local GCP unit. The funding source had no role in the design of this study and will not have any role during its execution, analyses, interpretation of the data, or decision to submit results.

Stopping rules In case of serious side effects or adverse events, the data will be monitored and the trial stopped if there is any evidence of lack of safety regarding the intervention and the study drugs. Included are unexpected complications in relation to colon cancer surgery.

Study course This study has two tracks depending on the pathology of the colon tumor. When colon cancer is suspected, patients are referred to a colonoscopy during which biopsies are taken to confirm pathology indicating adenocarcinoma or benign pathology. There is a retrospective track 2b, where the investigators will retrieve FFPE adenoma tissue from up to 28 random patients operated with endoscopic mucosal resection in 2018. The trial drugs will be accounted for - both per site and per patient.

Selection and enrollment of participants Consecutive patients with endoscopically diagnosed right-sided colon adenomas or right-sided colon cancer tumors will be eligible for inclusion in the study. The investigators plan to include 14 patients with colon cancer (track 1) and 14 patients with colon adenoma (track 2a).

Also, 28 patients with colon adenoma will be included retrospectively (track 2b). The investigators will retrieve FFPE tissue from the resected mucosa bearing adenoma. They have had endoscopic mucosal resection performed in 2018 at Department of Surgery, Zealand University Hospital.

Recruitment of patients will be done consecutively according to the Research Ethics Committee's recommendations. Patients who are eligible for inclusion will receive both oral and written information about the study. At the end of the enrolment meeting the patient may sign the informed consent if they wish, and may also be given the time needed for consideration (at least 24 hours). The informed consent will be written in accordance with the Danish law. Patients will be informed if any changes in the study occur, as this might influence the patient's willingness to participate or the safety of the participating patients. The approved document will be updated accordingly.

A completed test person

A completed test person is defined as:

* Track 1: a patient who received the therapeutic endoscopy and had preoperative blood samples drawn on the operation day. Other than the interview on the day of the out-patient clinic visit (approximately postoperative day 14) there is no further study-related physical follow-up of the patient.
* Track 2a: a patient who received the therapeutic endoscopy and had preoperative blood samples drawn on the operation day. Other than the telephone interview on postoperative day 14 there is no further study-related physical follow-up on the patients.

Dropout procedure Dropout and withdrawals may happen at any point from the written consent till the preoperative blood sample on the operation day, and will not have any influence on the treatment of the patient.

Participating patients can withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The patients will be informed of this right in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

The investigator can withdraw patients if the investigator feels the safety of the patient is compromised by the participation in the study. In that case, the investigator must inform the patient about the reason for withdrawal.

Patients who withdraw their consent will receive standard treatment. The reason, if stated, for the withdrawal will be noted in the CRFs. The number of dropouts and withdrawals will be reported. No further data will be collected from the patients withdrawing from the study; however, the previously collected data will be part of the final data analysis unless the patient specifically requests all data to be deleted.

Study interventions and procedures Intervention This is a non-randomized trial with an open label single group assignment. The intervention is a single therapeutic endoscopy during which patient´s right colon section will be sprayed with a predetermined volume of two component solutions, one containing fosfomycin and metronidazole, the other containing a gum that forms a gel on mixing with the former. During administration, the two components will be delivered through a dual channel colono-videoscope. The gel will form on the bowel wall and adhere to the mucosa.

Track 1: patients with colon cancer Preoperative procedures - blood samples On the day of the therapeutic endoscopy study, blood samples are drawn. Blood samples are analyzed for hemoglobin (Hb), leucocytes and differential counts, c-reactive protein (CRP), thrombocytes, albumin, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), transaminases in order to have baseline information on the patients and to be able to adjust for these variables in the multivariate analyses. Blood samples will also be analyzed for tumor-specific markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Samples are also analyzed by means of the nCounter® PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (nanoString).

Preoperative procedures - therapeutic endoscopy At least 24 hours after the patient has given informed consent to participating in the study, the patient will be given a bowel preparation. After 48-72 hours the therapeutic endoscopy will take place. The bowel preparation procedure will follow the different sites standard guidelines of bowel preparation using Picoprep. The patient will be offered to be sedated before the endoscopy. Pictures of the colon will be taken during the endoscopy.

Before spraying the right hemicolon, biopsies will be taken from the central and peripheral part of the tumor, and biopsies from the macroscopically normal mucosa in the proximal colon at least 10 cm orally and anally from the tumor.

The proximal colon will be sprayed with a predetermined volume of the study medication through a double spray catheter from the ileum to the right flexure using a Video Colonoscope. The study medication contains fosfomycin and metronidazole, which are mixed in situ with the gel-forming components formulated on behalf of Reponex Pharmaceuticals A/S.

Preoperative procedures - pathology Some biopsies taken during the therapeutic endoscopy will all be directly fixed in Phosphate-buffered (PBS-buffered) formalin and embedded in paraffin before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or immunologic tests are performed. One biopsy from the healthy mucosa, one biopsy from the tumor center and one biopsy from the tumor periphery will be frozen immediately following the local protocol.

Operation On the day of surgery, blood samples will be taken again. They will be analyzed using the same methods as the preoperative blood samples. Inclusion in the study does not interfere with the standard surgical protocol for patients with right-sided colon cancer.

Postoperative procedures - pathology The resected colon section will be sent unfixed to the Pathological Department at the site, where the initial macroscopic assessment is performed: measuring of the tumor, lymph node assessment etc. One tissue sample from the healthy mucosa, one tissue sample from the tumor center and one tissue sample from the tumor periphery will be frozen immediately following the local protocol. The hemicolon will then be formalin-fixed. The paraffin-embedded tumor samples will be cut according to the standard protocol before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or immunologic tests are performed. The histological assessment will follow the standard protocol.

Discharge The discharge criteria are the same for patients included in the study as for other patients on the ward. Discharge is expected to take place on the 3rd postoperative day if no complications arise. A prolonged hospital stay will be defined as 10 days after surgery.

Postoperative out-patient visit - follow-up Patients will be seen after their postoperative out-patient visit. The investigators will assess the patient's wellbeing and to ensure that any side effects or adverse reactions to the medicine in the trial are registered.

Follow-up Patients will be contacted by telephone 12 months after surgery. There is no further study-related physical follow-up on patients, as it has no influence on the endpoints. The investigators will however, read the patient's hospital files after 12 months to see whether the therapeutic endoscopy has changed the clinical course of the patient, i.e. if staging and oncological treatment are changed because of the procedure. The patients are receiving the standard post-operative program with ambulatory follow-up according to the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) recommendations.

Track 2: patients with adenomatous polyps of the colon Preoperative procedures - blood samples On the day of the therapeutic endoscopy, study blood samples are drawn. They will be analyzed by the same methods as the preoperative blood samples in Track 1.

Preoperative procedures - therapeutic endoscopy The bowel preparation procedure and sedation are the same as in Track 1. Pictures of the tumor will be taken during the endoscopy.

Before spraying the right hemicolon, biopsies from the macroscopically normal mucosa will be taken at least 10 cm orally and anally from the polyp.

The spraying procedure is the same as in Track 1.

Preoperative procedures - pathology Three of the four biopsies of the normal mucosa taken during the therapeutic endoscopy will all be directly fixed in PBS-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or immunologic tests are performed. One biopsy of the normal mucosa will be frozen immediately following the local protocol.

Resection On the day of resection, blood samples will be taken again. They will be analyzed by the same methods as the preoperative blood samples. During the endoscopic mucosal resection, biopsies from the healthy colon will be taken: two biopsies 10 cm orally and two biopsies 10 cm anally from the polyp.

Postoperative procedures - pathology Three of the four biopsies of the normal mucosa taken during the operation will all be fixed directly in PBS buffered formalin. One biopsy of the normal mucosa will be frozen immediately following the local protocol. The resected mucosa with the adenoma will be send non-fixed to the Pathological Department at the site, where the initial macroscopic assessment is performed, measurement of the polyp in three dimensions. The mucosa and the biopsies will be fixed with formalin, and will be cut according to the standard protocol and paraffin embedded before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or immunologic tests are performed. The histological assessment will follow the standard protocol.

Follow-up On postoperative day 14+/-2, an investigator will call the patient to assess the patient's wellbeing and to ensure that any side events or adverse reactions to the medicine in the trial are registered. The Follow-up is as in Track 1.

Archived FFPE tissue from patients with colon adenoma FPPE tissue blocks from colon adenomas will be retrieved from the archive of Department of Pathology, Zealand University Hospital. The tissue blocks will be cut according to standard protocol. They will be analyzed as the tissue from the resected mucosa of the patients included in track 2a.

Pathology procedures for both tracks The paraffin blocks will be sectioned in series. In each step, the section 1 is stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E), section 3 is stained immunohistochemically for CD8 and CD3 (following the local immunoscore protocol), and section 5 will be stained for CD68 (macrophages). Sections 7, 9 and 11 will be analyzed for bacterial biofilm using a general bacterial PNA FISH probe. Section 13 will be prepared for PanCancer IO 360TM Gene Expression Panel (nanoString) analysis following the nanoString protocol. The remaining sections (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) remain unstained, and will be kept at -80°C.

Microbiology procedures for both tracks In this study tissue samples will be analyzed for bacteria and biofilm using Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Metagenome sequencing. These analyzes will be performed at Costerton Biofilm Center.

Safety assessments In this study, patients are administered the study drugs in a standard single dose of 800 mg of fosfomycin and 200 mg of metronidazole. The general dosage guideline for adults treated with fosfomycin infusions is 6 g\*3 per day (in patients with renal insufficiency and a creatinine clearance of 10 ml/min the suggested dose is 1 g\*2 per day). The general dosage guideline for treatment with metronidazole is 1500 mg as a single infusion.

Blood samples The drawing of blood samples will result in some discomfort and may risk bruising at the site. A total of 8.5mL will be drawn at the sites: Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, and Herlev Hospital (3.0 mL Gel + LiHep Tubes + 3.0 mL EDTA Tubes + 2.5 mL PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes). A total of 11.5 mL will be drawn at the site: Zealand University Hospital, Køge (3.0 mL Gel + LiHep Tubes + 3.0 mL Gel + LiHep Tubes + 3.0 mL EDTA Tubes + 2.5 mL PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes).

Therapeutic endoscopy:

In this study a full colonoscopy is necessary to deliver the study medication to the mucosa of the right hemicolon. Also, to assess the effect of the local antibiotic treatment it is necessary to take biopsies from the healthy mucosa, and if the patient is included in track 1, also the colon cancer tumor. Forty-eight-72 hours before a colonoscopy the patient needs to be given a bowel preparation (15). There are risks associated with a colonoscopy: intestinal bleeding, bowel perforation, localized infection, adverse reaction to the sedatives and generalized bowel infection. Of these, intestinal bleeding and iatrogenic bowel perforation are the most prominent adverse events associated with a significant mortality rate and the need for surgical intervention. The risk of accidental bowel perforation has been estimated to 0.85/1000, and the risk of bleeding has been estimated to 1.64/1000 (16). However, the complications are less common with colonoscopies that do not involve polypectomy, such as this study. The colonoscopy will be performed by a trained specialist surgeon in the out-patient clinic. Patients unable to be sedated due to known allergies or comorbidities have already been excluded from study participation.

Adverse events During and after administration of fosfomycin and metronidazole any adverse events or intercurrent illnesses will be reported. Patients who have known allergy to fosfomycin and or metronidazole are excluded from study participation. Treatment with metronidazole is known to give rise to Antabuse (disulfiram)-like reactions in patients who continue to drink alcohol. Patients who are currently heavy drinkers are excluded from study participation. Patients will be orally instructed not to drink alcohol from the day before the therapeutic endoscopy during the enrollment meeting. This information is included in the Patient information. A summary of the product characteristics of fosfomycin and metronidazole will function as reference documents in evaluation of adverse effects. The investigators will monitor adverse events from the day of the intervention until postoperative day 14 (approximately 19 days in total). Safety of the intervention will be measured by adverse events.

All serious adverse events (SAE) will be registered and reported to the sponsor by investigator within 24 hour after the event has been recorded. All adverse events will be reported to the Danish Medicines Agency and the local Ethics Committee in an annual report with a report on patient safety of the trial. All serious adverse reactions (SAR) will be reported in an annual report together with a report on patient safety to the Danish Medicines Agency. All SAR will be judged through the product summary if they are a possible suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). The investigators are responsible for reporting all lethal or life-threatening SUSAR to the Danish Medicines Agency and the regional Ethical Committee as soon as possible and no later than 7 days after knowledge of such reaction has been received. No later than after 8 days after the reporting, will the Danish Medicines Agency be informed of the follow-up. All other SUSAR will be reported to the Danish Medicines Agency and the regional Ethics Committee no later than 15 days after knowledge has been received by the sponsor and the investigators. The patient will in these situations be followed until the reaction has terminated either via the outpatient clinic at the hospital or via contact with the sponsor or the investigators.

Statistical considerations The investigators plan to include 14 consecutive patients with right-sided colon adenoma and 14 consecutive patients with right-sided colon cancer tumor. The trial will end by the last visit of the last patient. The retrospective cohort of 28 patients with colon adenoma (track 2b) will be matched 2:1 with the prospective 14 patients with right-sided colon adenoma (track 2a). The investigators estimate a dropout rate of 15%. Therefore inclusion will stop by the 24th fully evaluable patient. This is a clinical proof-of-concept intervention study, and the investigators are to our knowledge the first group to look into local antibiotic treatment of biofilm in patients with colon cancer or colon adenoma. the investigators expect this number of patients to be sufficient to provide the necessary experience in implementing the technique and form a basis for future studies, including their sample size calculation.

Data will be analyzed using non-parametric statistics or parametric statistics depending on the distribution of the data. P-values \<0.05 are considered significant. Correction for multiple comparisons will be performed if needed. Descriptive statistics will be used for baseline characteristics. Both a principal intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis will be performed, along with a standard sensitivity analysis. The effect of any missing data will be assessed with sensitivity analyses. Missing data will be addressed with a creation of clinically responsible imputations. The investigators will focus on molecular signatures discovery using supervised analyses (statistical tests like t-test or Wilcoxon test) and unsupervised analyses like PCA (principal component analysis) and ICA (independent component analysis). Statistics will be performed in collaboration with biostatistician Nicolas Derian.

Patients included in track 2a, who are diagnosed with cancer after the postoperative pathological assessment of the polyp, will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Data collection and quality assessment In accordance with Danish law on personal data, the investigators will seek approval for this trial from the Danish Data Protection Agency. Data handling will be in accordance with the act on processing of sensitive personal information, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act. The investigators will also seek approval for the trial from The Research Ethics Committee and the Danish Medicines Agency.

Data from each patient will be recorded continuously and written in forms (CRF) prepared before the trial begins. During the recruitment meeting, the investigators will use a paper work sheet for baseline data and inclusion/exclusion criteria. During the therapeutic endoscopy, the investigators will use paper work sheets for data collection; afterwards data will be entered into an electronic database using the Easytrial platform. All other data will be recorded directly to the electronic Easytrial database. The paper work sheets will be stored identifiable in a locked cabinet at the respective research sites. All collected data will have source documentation.

Data will be stored as personally identifiable for 10 years, after which they are deleted the 1st of February 2029. Data will be stored in compliance with GDPR and at Teamsite (secure data storage).

If a patient withdraws from the study, the collected data will be anonymized. If the patient requests the collected data to be deleted, this will be done.

Good Clinical Practice and quality assessment This trial is performed in accordance with the Danish Medicines Act §88 section 2 and the order on good clinical practice number 744 of 29th of June 2006. The trial will be monitored by a Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit, Capital Region of Denmark. The existing procedures for quality assurance and control in intervention studies will be followed through a scheduled monitoring agreement at the beginning, mid-term and at the end of the project. At auditing, monitoring and/or inspection from the Danish Medicines Agency, GCP-unit or from other relevant authorities, these will all be allowed relevant access to the data and information stored.

Ethical considerations The study is performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and Danish law 593 of 14th June 2011 on the Research Ethics Committee's practices regarding health research trials. The project has been approved by the department management, the Danish Data Protection Agency (REG-010-2019), the Regional Research Ethics Committee (number SJ-753), and the Danish Medicines Agency (2019-000131-51). The study is registered at the EudraCT (number 2019-000131-51) and will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. The trial will be monitored by the local GCP Unit. Any modification of the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, potential benefit of the patient or may affect patient safety, including changes of study objectives, study design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. An amendment will be agreed upon by the study group and will need the approval of the Ethics Committee as well as other authorities prior to implementation, if suited.

The study will be conducted in the Surgical Department, Herlev Hospital, and Zealand University Hospital. It will contribute to the clarification of whether local antibiotic treatment of the colon tumor and the surrounding normal mucosa has a place in the treatment of colon cancer and colon adenomas.

Study patients are included after they have received oral and written information and after written consent has been obtained. At any time, the patients can withdraw their consent without impairing their relationship to the investigator or the doctors involved and without prejudicing their treatment at the Department. All patients can require further information about the project from the clinically responsible doctor.

The patients will be informed of any additional health information found in the study.

Funding and insurance DMSc Ismail Gögenur (sponsor), MD Hans Raskov (investigator), MD Mahdi Alamili (investigator) and MD Astrid Bennedsen (principal investigator) initiated this project. The investigators and the sponsor have no financial interests or conflicts of interest in this study. Reponex Pharmaceuticals A/S (Slotsmarken 12, 1.th.DK-2970 Hørsholm) will distribute the trial drugs and colonoscopes to the participating departments as well as cover salary expenses for MD Hans Raskov and MD Astrid Bennedsen and the running costs of the trial. The funding source had no role in the design of this study and will not have any role during its execution, analyses, interpretation of the data, or decision to submit results.

Information about external funding is included in the written information for the patients.

Insurance Patients are covered by the already existing insurance for hospitalized patients in the Surgical Department, Herlev Hospital and Zealand University Hospital (Patient Insurance Scheme).

The Research Ethics Committee and the Danish Medicines Agency will be informed within 90 days when the last patient has had the last visit, and a final report will be reported within 12 months in the EUDRA database.

No later than 12 months after trial termination, an article including the obtained results will be submitted for publication in an internationally recognized peer-reviewed journal with high impact. The investigators expect to get three publications from the study; a feasibility publication with a detailed description of the methods, a publication of the results of the intervention on patients with colon cancer and a publication on patients with colon adenoma. Authorship eligibility will be based on the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).",COMPLETED,,2020-01-16,2023-07-01,2022-04-13,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,28,ACTUAL
NCT05851560,Prospective Comparison of the Effect on Antiadhesive Barriers During Thyroid or Parathyroid Surgery,Prospective Comparison of the Effect on Antiadhesive Barriers During Thyroid or Parathyroid Surgery,"Despite use of meticulous surgical techniques and regardless of surgical access via conventional open or endoscopy, postoperative adhesions develop in the vast majority of patients undergoing neck surgery. Such adhesions represent not only adhesion reformation at sites of adhesiolysis, but also de novo adhesion formation at sites of surgical procedures. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of adhesion development and distinguishing variations in the molecular biologic mechanisms represent future opportunities to improve the reduction of postoperative adhesions.

After surgical tissue injury, there were local release of histamine, cytokines, and growth factors that lead to adhesion development. Other than survival or safety issues, cosmetics concerns and quality of life are the motifs after thyroid surgeries currently. Pos-thyroidectomy adhesions include various symptoms such as neck discomfort, neck tightness, skin adhesion to the trachea, skin scarring from adhesive reaction, and vocal cord palsy or impairment of laryngeal vertical movement. Relief of the adhesion through wound massage or anti-adhesion agents could reduce neck discomfort and voice changes.Although oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) and hyaluronic acid (HA) appeared to be safe and effective to decrease the incidence of adhesions, to improve adhesion-related neck discomfort, and to prevent skin adhesion to the trachea after neck surgery. The application of antiadhesive barriers after neck surgery is safe but the effect is still uncertain. Thus, we aim to confirm the antiadhesive effect of multiple antiadhesive barriers in thyroid/parathyroid surgery.","The postsurgical adhesions remain a significant cause of morbidity for a large number of patients in thyroid and parathyroid surgeries, despite use of meticulous surgical techniques and regardless of surgical access via conventional open or endoscopy. Such adhesions represent not only adhesion reformation at sites of adhesiolysis, but also de novo adhesion formation at sites of surgical procedures. A number of products, in the form of film or fluid, are used to prevent postoperative adhesion formation. These products normally serve as barriers to separate the contact of the damaged tissue surfaces in many animal models and some clinical practices. However, there are few evidences for surgeons to use or no use, or choose the suitable products in their clinical practice in neck surgeries. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of adhesion development and distinguishing variations in the molecular biologic mechanisms represent future opportunities to improve the reduction of postoperative adhesions.

After surgical tissue injury, there were local release of histamine, cytokines, and growth factors that lead to adhesion development . Local tissue inflammation processes initiate capillary leakage of serosanguineous fluid including clotting factors, and recruitment of macrophages and other cells, including fibroblasts. Cutting, fulguration, ligation of the macrovasculature and microvasculature leads to a state of tissue hypoxemia. Along with the accumulation of metabolic byproducts such as lactic acid, the lowering the pH of the injured tissue, and the conversion from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism within the injured tissues. Tissue hypoxia also results in creation of oxidative stress, with production of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals, which can result in DNA mutations, alterations of mitochondrial DNA, and generation of oxidized proteins.

Subsequently induce lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. The known factors involved in the inflammatory-like response that lead to adhesion development, are type 1 collagen, transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Of note, the scavenging of free radicals such as superoxide by superoxide dismutase can prevent the development of the adhesion phenotype . Other processes affected include plasminogen activator activity (PAA) (a function of tissue plasminogen activator and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), metalloproteinase activity, and extracellular matrix deposition (such as collagen 1, collagen 3, and fibronectin). There is also initiation of processes leading to angiogenesis, which can lead to new vessel formation that could resupply oxygen to these tissues as well as remove metabolic byproducts.",UNKNOWN,,2023-05-24,2023-12,2023-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,45,ESTIMATED

The primary hypothesis is that cost-saving and simple TCA treatment is non-inferior to the current best option therapy with ECA. TCA treatment would also be possible in the normal setting of a doctor´s office without extensive specialization and without complex technical equipment.","Anal human papillomavirus (HPV)-infection and HPV-induced AIN, an anal cancer precursor, are very frequent in HIV-positive patients (HIV+), especially in men who have sex with men (MSM), but also in women. Consequently, HIV+ have a strongly increased risk for anal cancer. Screening for and treatment of AIN are recommended in HIV+, although only two RCT on AIN treatment have been published. We plan a multicenter, unblinded, non-inferiority RCT that evaluates the efficacy and safety of 2 high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-guided treatment options for AIN: topical application of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and surgical treatment with electrocautery (ECA).

ECA was the best option for intra-anal AIN in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT). TCA, an inexpensive and established therapy for genital warts, has been evaluated for AIN only in a retrospective pilot study that showed clearance rates comparable to those found for ECA, with possibly less adverse events (AE). Our primary hypothesis is that cost-saving and simple TCA is non-inferior to ECA. 2800 HIV+ will be screened by HRA in 9 proctological centers and 560 HIV+ with histologically confirmed intra-anal AIN will be randomized (1:1) to receive up to 4 treatments with TCA or ECA within 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical (HRA) and histological resolution of AIN 4 weeks after the last treatment. Secondary endpoints comprise recurrence of AIN 24 weeks after end of therapy, the number of interventions, AE, and the influence of HPV parameters such as anal HPV-types, viral load and HPV-oncogene-mRNA.",COMPLETED,,2015-11,2021-12-31,2020-03-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,560,ACTUAL

NCT01547260,Lenalidomide and Gemcitabine as First-line Treatment in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer,Phase I/II Study of Lenalidomide and Gemcitabine as First-line Treatment in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer,The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether treatment with lenalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with gemcitabine induces modulation of immune effector functions and to characterize the nature of immune functions.,"Pancreatic cancer is characterised by aggressive growth, treatment resistance and an extremely poor prognosis. In subjects with locally advanced or metastatic disease, the median survival is approximately 6 - 11 months and 2 - 6 months, respectively. The currently accepted treatment for this disease in EU is gemcitabine which supplanted treatment with 5-FU after it was shown that median survival duration was marginally improved (4.41 and 5.65 months respectively, p = 0,022). The reported median survival time for subjects treated with single-agent gemcitabine in randomized phase III studies ranged form 4.9 to 7.2 months. Despite these improvements in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, the prognosis remains very poor. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) belongs to a proprietary class of compounds called immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). IMiDshave both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties which could confer antitumour and antimetastatic effects. Lenalidomide has been demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induced endothelial cell migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF.In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory effects. Gemcitabine (Gemzar®) is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that is used as standard treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Beside the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine, accumulating evidence has indicated that the product promote specific anticancer immune responses that contribute to the therapeutic effects of conventional therapy.Down-regulation in survival rate of pancreatic cell lines has more recently been observed, when treated with lenalidomide and gemcitabine in sub-optimal concentrations.Those data supports a hypothesis of a potential hyper-additive affect of the treatments given in combination. Therefore lenalidomide and gemcitabine should be of major interest to explore for combination therapy.

This is a phase I/II open-label, multi-center study. It will consist of a phase I dose-finding part and a phase II part during which subjects will be treated at the MTD established during phase I. Lenalidomide will be administered by a stepwise dose-escalation schedule in the phase I part. Thus, the primary endpoint in the phase I part is to determine the MTD and safety of the regimen lenalidomide and gemcitabine as first-line treatment in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer.In the phase II part, primary endpoint is to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in combination with gemcitabine in the same patient population.",COMPLETED,,2009-10,2014-11,2014-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,34,ACTUAL

The incidence of choric postoperative pain (CPSP) in thoracic surgery has been reported to be 20%-80%. However, there has been not an standard treatment for CPSP. Many study has showed the risk factors of CPSP in thoracic surgery, such as VATS type, operation time, duration of drainage, preoperative pain, repeat surgery, gender, postoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy , etc. It is important that moderate-to-severe acute postoperative pain will be transformed into CPSP. That offers a new management goal in postoperative pain prevention.CT-guided hookwire localization have been proven to be benefical for VATS to diagnose and treat small pulmonary , it can shorten operation timing and increase surgery success rate. However, it causes roughly 23.8% severe pain and complaints included wire dislodgement, pneumothorax and haemorrhage during and after insertion. The question is whether or not the moderate-to-severe acute postoperative pain from hookwire localition will change the incidence and intensity of CPSP in VATS.

Nurses play a pivotal role in advanced practice, research, and education in the field of pain management. The pain management of hookwire localization may be a new vison in further research.",COMPLETED,,2021-08-10,2022-07-21,2022-07-21,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,161,ACTUAL

NCT01172860,Endoscopic Treatment of Inoperable Colorectal Cancer With the EndoVe System,Treatment of Inoperable Colorectal Cancer With Electrochemotherapy Through an Endoscopic System,"A new approach to treating solid tumours (both operable and inoperable) has been carried out by the Cork Cancer Research Centre (CCRC) at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland since 2002.

The approach simply allows a greater concentration of chemotherapy drugs to enter the tumour cells rather than healthy cells. The uptake of the chemotherapeutic drug directly by the tumour is aided through applying short electric pulses to the tumor mass (referred to as - Electrochemotherapy or ECT). The pulses make the tumour more porous which allows the drug easier access into the cancer cells, whereas other tissues and organs in the body remain relatively poor at absorbing the drug, thereby reducing the potential side effects on healthy tissues. This approach to date has been limited to skin based tumours due to the requirement for the electrodes to be placed directly in contact with the tumour. Procedures with electrochemotherapy have been applied to human patients in other countries of the EU, the US and Japan.

The drug concentration used is significantly reduced due to the more targeted absorption by the tumor and this significantly reduces side effects normally associated with chemotherapy.

A large number of preclinical and clinical Phase I and I/II studies have demonstrated the efficiency and safety of ECT. These studies have included patients with melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, merkel cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma nodules. Case reports concerning other primary tumours have also been reported.

The investigators have developed an endoscopic approach (EndoVe system) for delivering the electric pulses to internal cancers and are currently seeking to evaluate its efficacy in the treatment of inoperable colorectal cancer. The treatment procedure is similar to standard endoscopic colorectal examination (colonoscopy) with the added element of an intravenous injection of bleomycin followed after eight minutes by the delivery of electric pulses (each one less than 1msec in duration). The pulses are endoscopically delivered directly to the tumour mass. The entire procedure is minimally invasive and does not require intensive care follow up or stitches. If the treatment is successful the tumour will shrink in size in the weeks following the procedure.

The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of this approach in reducing the size of the tumour.","The objective is to conduct treatment in a minimally invasive manner (using the endoscope) and without the requirement for repeated doses of chemotherapy. The single dose of the drug used (15,000 IU/m2 x Body Surface Area of bleomycin) has been well tolerated in all patients treated previously with this approach to skin based cancers (in excess of 300 treatments since 2003 in our hospital). Therefore, it is anticipated that patients are unlikely to suffer side effects from the low concentration of drug used.

There are no known side effects of the instrument being tested. The pulse generator used has been certified by European electrical safety bodies charged with assessing compliance of new equipment with the present security rules for electrical devices. The electrical pulse generator has the CE mark and is approved for use clinically; the endoscopic electrodes used are a prototype system and are not currently CE approved.

The treatment is provided on an outpatient basis and does not involve an overnight stay. The procedure is very similar to a colonoscopy examination with the added element of a low dose chemotherapy drug being injected intravenously.

It reduces operative time; therefore there are fewer anaesthetic risks

At this time, the only option for patients with inoperable colorectal cancers is symptom relief e.g. a defunctioning colostomy or stent placement. Both carry a risk profile greater than the treatment with the EndoVe system.

Quicker recovery time- This is beneficial for the patient in terms of reduced exposure to the hospital environment through a shorter in-patient stay.

Research: The potential benefits of studying novel medical instruments in general include the development of new alternatives to conventional or existing therapies for certain cancers. In particular, the widespread availability of the novel instrument being tested here may lessen the requirement for more invasive procedures. It will reduce the amount of chemotherapy drug being used, therefore reducing the systemic effects as well as the side effects.

The approach is currently being applied to inoperable cases but in the future it may potentially be applied to both earlier stage cancers and other internal cancers e.g. oesophagus, stomach etc.

Because the treatment procedure is short (outpatient basis), it allows these patients greater time outside of the hospital environment to maximise and allowing for a greater quality of life (this for both individual patient and community at large).

If this treatment approach is proven to be safe and effective, patients with inoperable colorectal cancers will have a minimally invasive option for palliation of symptoms.",COMPLETED,,2010-03,2016-09,2016-09,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,10,ESTIMATED

NCT03495960,Study on Tailored Treatment in Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed Primary Lymphoma of Central Nervous System,Randomized Phase II Trial on Fitness- and Comorbidity- Tailored Treatment in Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed Primary CNS Lymphoma (FIORELLA Trial),"Primary central nervous system lymphomas are rare aggressive malignancies, usually treated in two steps: an induction phase (where a combination of chemotherapy is given) followed by a consolidation phase (where patients usually receive one of the following: whole-brain irradiation, chemotherapy supported by autologous stem-cell transplantation, other type of chemotherapy, or are just observed).

The feasibility of this overall strategy, for several reasons, is limited in elderly patients .

This study involves patients aged ≥70 years. The more fit patients will receive the standard chemotherapy combination (high-dose methotrexate, procarbazine and rituximab) as induction. Responding patients will receive either procarbazine or lenalidomide as maintenance therapy; the aim is to evaluate the efficacy of these two drugs.

The more fragile patients will receive a less aggressive therapy consisting of concomitant whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab as induction therapy, followed by temozolomide as maintenance treatment; the aim is to evaluate the efficacy of this combination of treatment.","Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) are rare aggressive malignancies, mostly of B-cell origin, representing 4% of intracranial neoplasms and 4-6% of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Despite improvements in treatment, PCNSL is associated with an aggressive course and unsatisfactory outcome. The median age at diagnosis is 61 years and age over 60 years has been reported to be an independent factor for a poorer outcome.

The modern treatment of PCNSL includes two phases: induction and consolidation. The induction phase usually consists of a polychemotherapy combination, including high-dose methotrexate as a critical drug, while there are at least four different strategies that can be used as consolidation: whole-brain irradiation, myeloblative chemotherapy supported by autologous stem-cell transplantation, non-myeloblative chemotherapy, observation (only in patients who achieve complete remission after induction).

The feasibility of this overall strategy is limited, for several reasons, in elderly patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL. High-doses of antimetabolite-based chemotherapy, the standard induction for patients younger than 70 years, is often not feasible in elderly patients. Among maintenance strategies, simple observation results in unacceptably high relapse rate and associated mortality while whole-brain irradiation and aggressive chemotherapies are associated with unacceptable toxicity and poor outcome. Thus, new strategies aimed at obtaining durable responses with an acceptable tolerability and reduced risk of neurocognitive decline are needed and these strategies should be tailored not only based on the patients' age but also on their specific co-morbidities and general health conditions.

For the present trial, all patients aged ≥70 years taken into care at the participating sites will be invited to participate and after informed consent signature their baseline data will be collected in the trial database, including data of patients resulting in screening failure. This will allow to verify any potential screening bias by comparing the characteristics of included and excluded patients. Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria are then screened for their suitability to receive a more or less aggressive anticancer treatment and assigned to two different treatment strategies accordingly.

Part A:

The more fit patients are assigned to the trial Part A and will receive the standard combination of high-dose methotrexate, procarbazine and rituximab as induction. Responding patients will subsequently be randomized to receive either procarbazine or lenalidomide as maintenance therapy.

Procarbazine is a lipophilic oral alkylating agent, easily crossing the blood brain barrier (up to 100% of plasma levels). There is no known cumulative toxicity for procarbazine and it is therefore currently in use as a viable maintenance treatment option aimed at eliminating residual lymphoma cells in the CNS and reduce the risk of relapse. Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory agent, active against diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the most common category in PCNSL, which can be taken for years, showing an excellent safety profile. On this background, the Part A of the present trial consists of a randomized phase II trial conducted in elderly patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL responsive to high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy, comparing two different maintenance strategies: the oral chemotherapeutic drug procarbazine and the oral immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide.

Part B:

The more fragile patients are assigned to the trial Part B and will receive a less aggressive therapy consisting of concomitant whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab as induction therapy, followed by temozolomide single-agent as maintenance treatment.

Whole-brain radiotherapy is the main therapeutic choice for patients with contraindications to chemotherapy and in particular for elderly patients. Brain irradiation is usually associated with transient disruption of the blood-tumor barrier, occurring from 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy to 1 month after its completion, during which pharmaceutical agents have maximum access to tumor tissue. Concomitant delivery of active cytostatics, therefore, could result in increased tumor uptake. Concomitant delivery of radiotherapy and temozolomide is currently used as standard approach for the treatment of high-grade gliomas, with acceptable toxicity despite the use of a larger irradiation dose. Based on the above, in the Part B of the present trial, temozolomide and rituximab, two agents active against PCNSL, are delivered concomitantly to whole-brain radiotherapy to obtain a synergistic effect of radiation damage, antineoplastic effect of rituximab and cytostatic and radiomimetic effects of temozolomide. Finally, temozolomide maintenance has shown to be beneficial regarding sustained remission after initial response to induction therapy and its suitability to improve disease control in responding patients not fit for more aggressive therapies will therefore be tested in the Part B of this trial.",COMPLETED,,2019-06-15,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,72,ACTUAL
NCT06809660,Effects of Endocrine Disruptors on the Gut Microbiota and Assessment of Their Impact on Colorectal Cancer Development (PERMICA),Effects of Endocrine Disruptors on the Gut Microbiota and Assessment of Their Impact on Colorectal Cancer Development,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, yet it was the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 2020. The average French population faces a colorectal cancer risk partly linked to lifestyle factors. The majority of colorectal cancer cases (approximately 85%) are not caused by hereditary mutations. Environmental factors, such as lifestyle or diet (notably through endocrine disruptors), can affect the gut microbiota (a collection of microorganisms - bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi - residing in the intestinal environment) and lead to disturbances in its composition, referred to as dysbiosis. While the mechanisms underlying dysbiosis associated with colorectal cancer remain poorly understood, the involvement of certain ingested substances, known as xenobiotics, is increasingly suspected, including endocrine disruptors. Among the most common endocrine disruptors found in water and food are parabens and phthalates, which will be examined in detail in this study. These substances may be directly involved in the development of colorectal cancer and in response to its treatment.

The main objective of this studie is to characterize the relationship between colorectal cancer diagnosis, activity/composition of the gut microbiota, and patients' exposure to selected endocrine disruptors, particularly parabens and phthalates.","Methodology:

Pilot, single-center regional study, with a descriptive and comparative design (patients with colorectal cancer / patients without suspected colorectal cancer = controls).

In each group, a stool, hair and urine sample will be collected and an endocrine disruptor exposure questionnaire completed.

Sample Size and Duration:

A total of 200 patients will be included, divided into two groups of 100 patients (100 patients with colorectal cancer and 100 patients without suspected colorectal cancer). The inclusion period will last 48 months, with each participant enrolled for a maximum of one month. Routine care data will be collected over 5 years. The total duration of the clinical investigation will be approximately 9 years.

Expected Outcomes:

The investigators aim at determining whether the most common endocrine disruptors in the French population are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and if these substances are correlated with dysbiotic colorectal microbiota.

The findings from this study should help identify the endocrine disruptors most frequently associated with colorectal cancer and thereby enhance vigilance regarding these substances.

However, for atypical meningioma after total resection, there is still a huge controversy in patients who need adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery.

Many scholars have focused on this problem and carried out some small-scale retrospective studies, but they have contradictory results. Some of the studies found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy could not improve the prognosis of patients, but was questioned because the sample size was too small, resulting in insignificant results, while other studies found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy can improve progression free survival. A study based on the National Cancer Database found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and gross tumor resection are associated with a good prognosis. A recent meta-analysis enrolled a total of 757 patients and found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy reduced the risk of tumor recurrence but did not improve survival time. Our team reviewed the meningioma data in the SEER database and conducted a study previously. The study found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve the overall survival of these patients. The relevant research results were recently published in Frontiers in oncology. We further reviewed and summarized the single-center data of our hospital and found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy could not improve the progression free survival and overall survival of patients. Besides, we also performed a meta-analysis and found that postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy had a trend to improve progression-free survival, but there was no statistical difference.

Because there are many deficiencies in previous researches, and the research results are also contradictory, it is still unclear whether patients with atypical meningioma who have undergone gross total resection can benefit from postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Further high quality clinical trials is still needed to be conducted in order to guide the postoperative care of patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct this multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine the value of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with atypical meningioma who underwent gross total resection.","The study aims to enroll a total of 140 participants. Subjects would be enrolled with the following information: name, age, gender, contact, KPS score, preoperative ASA score, current ECOG score, tumor location, date of surgery, degree of tumor resection (modified Simpson grade), pathology type, Ki-67 Proliferation index, etc. The preoperative magnetic resonance image of the subject is stored. Tissue specimens are genetically examined.

Using a simple randomization method and random assignment in a 1:1 ratio, a random sequence was first generated, and SAS version 9.1 statistical software was used to generate an allocation sequence table including subject numbers, 140 random numbers, and random groupings. 140 Subjects would be assigned to the test group (n=70) and the control group (n=70) in a 1:1 ratio. The table of the assignment sequence is duplicated and saved by the neurosurgical secretary and the trial designer of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. The secretary puts the group mark into the 140 opaque kraft envelopes with the serial number 1 to 140 according to the order of the allocation sequence table, and submits them to the test designer.

Colonoscopy is a preferred colorectal screening modality since it has both diagnostic and therapeutic capability. Detection and removal of polyps at colonoscopy decreases the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer.

Typical practice is to insert the colonoscope rapidly until it reaches the cecum (a pouch-like portion of the intestines, where the large bowel and the small bowel meet). The physician then withdraws the colonoscope slowly and looks for any polyps or abnormalities within the large bowel. The purpose of this study is to compare this standard practice to the approach whereby the physician examines the bowel as the scope is initially inserted AND as the colonoscope is withdrawn from patients' colons.",,COMPLETED,,2009-11,2012-01,2011-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,768,ACTUAL
NCT04374760,Increasing Cervical Cancer Screening Uptake Among Emergency Department Patients,Increasing Cervical Cancer Screening Uptake Among Emergency Department Patients,Invasive cervical cancer is preventable with adequate screening but screening rates are considerably below national goals. Emergency departments care for a disproportionate number of women who are not up to date with recommended cervical cancer screening. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile technology based behavioral intervention (using text messaging prompts) to increase cervical cancer screening uptake among emergency department patients.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is preventable. Screening for CC aims to identify treatable lesions prior to the development of invasive CC which, without screening, is often first detected at a stage when comfort care is all that can be offered. Still, only 80% of U.S. women age 21 - 65 report adherence to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) CC screening recommendations. This rate is considerably below the Healthy People 2020 target of 93%8. Lower rates of screening have been particularly pronounced among racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower education levels. The group most likely to be non-adherent with screening guidelines is women who use the emergency department (ED) for their usual source of care. The ED setting, therefore, is optimal for the deployment of an intervention to promote CC screening. Although designed to address acute illnesses and injuries, the ED is an effective environment to advance preventive health. Numerous preventive health interventions have been successfully deployed in the ED including smoking cessation, HIV testing, and depression screening. Interventions delivered in the ED often suffer from lack of follow up and hence low adherence. Novel approaches are needed to reinforce health messages delivered in the acute context of the ED. Short Message Service (SMS) on mobile phones, also known as text messaging, is a low-cost, scalable, and effective means of delivering health behavior interventions. According to the Pew Research Center, the vast majority of Americans - 95% - own a cell phone, and an estimated 98% of all cell phones have texting capabilities. Evidence-based SMS interventions for health behavior include smoking cessation,primary care attendance, breast cancer screening, and sun safety, among others. However, minimal research has been conducted applying SMS interventions to CC screening and no prior research, apart from our pilot work, has targeted a CC prevention intervention by leveraging the universal healthcare access setting of the ED. In 2018-19 the investigators conducted a randomized clinical trial pilot (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03483610; NIH Grant ID: UL1TR002001) among ED patients non-adherent with USPSTF recommendations comparing an SMS intervention group to a referral-only control group to improve CC screening uptake at follow-up. The intervention consisted of a series of text messages, grounded in behavioral change theory, aimed at generating intention to get screened. The results of this pilot: (A) demonstrated the feasibility of our approach, (B) showed preliminary evidence of efficacy, and (C) provided an effect size estimate. Our overarching goal is to develop a low-cost, scalable SMS intervention that increases CC screening uptake among ED patients and can be deployed in heterogenous ED settings. The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of this intervention. Step 1 of our approach is to identify whether the participant is adherent with screening guidelines. Step 2 is to randomize non-adherent participants to one of the two treatment conditions: (1) referral only (control) or, (2) referral and an SMS-intervention consisting of a series of text messages, grounded in behavioral change theory, aimed at generating intention and autonomous motivation to get screened. To limit costs and increase the scalability of the intervention, determination of adherence with screening guidelines via a self-administered questionnaire on a tablet computer will be evaluated. A total of 1,460 non-adherent women, age 21-65, will be recruited from a high-volume urban ED and a low-volume rural ED, randomized among study conditions, and followed-up at 150 days to assess interval CC screening uptake.

Aim 1: Compare CC screening uptake between SMS intervention and control groups. Hypothesis 1: Uptake of CC screening in the SMS intervention group will be greater than in the control group at 150-day follow-up.This aim will determine the efficacy of the intervention.

Aim 2: Compare the impact of in-person (using research staff) versus self-administered (using a tablet) determination of CC screening adherence on the efficacy of the intervention.

Hypothesis 2: The method of determining adherence will not impact the efficacy of the intervention. This aim will evaluate an approach to limit cost and increase the scalability of intervention implementation. Aim 3: Identify mediators and explore moderators of intervention effects on CC screening uptake at follow-up.

Hypothesis 3: Uptake in the intervention group will be mediated by theory-posited proximal predictors. This aim will elucidate the mechanism of behavioral change resulting from the intervention and identify differential effects among study sub-groups.

This project leverages the universal access setting of the ED to target women most at risk for non-adherence with CC screening guidelines. A low-cost, scalable intervention that increases CC screening uptake in this population would decrease CC incidence and save lives. Our next step would be a multi-site effectiveness trial using the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Network.",COMPLETED,,2020-12-03,2024-01-31,2023-07-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,SCREENING,1116,ACTUAL

The study seeks also to arrive at a recommended dose and schedule for future investigations, evidence of anti-tumor activity, detection of virus in body fluids, analysis of viral delivery to tumor and normal cells, and to evaluate if there is an antibody response to vaccinia virus.","Peritoneal carcinomatosis includes a variety of tumors with extensive metastasis throughout the peritoneal cavity (inside surface of the abdomen) and can be found with gall bladder, liver, colon, appendix, ovarian, pancreas, mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, rectal, small bowel and stomach cancers. It broadly includes multiple tumors that develop in and line the peritoneal abdominal cavity and linings. These tumors may be difficult to completely remove surgically and may recur despite conventional systemic chemotherapy, thereby resulting in poor patient outcomes. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has shown the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30 different human tumors. A Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 intravenously administered to patients with a variety of solid tumor entities has shown that GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of antitumor activity.

NCT06129760,Glioblastoma Remote Monitoring and Care - Research Protocol,Glioblastoma Remote Monitoring and Care - Research Protocol,"The purpose of this research is to learn more about how what the Apple watch measures, in terms of walking data, heart rate, breathing rate, and sleep habits, relates to how participants feel. During the course of the treatment, the symptoms participants experience change, and whether the Apple watch can detect these changes. Ultimately, this knowledge is being used to design proactive tools and signatures that can predict complications or symptom changes before they happen.","Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with a near-universal rate of recurrence, and reports low median survivals of between 14 and 18 months, even with maximal therapy. Although participants have frequent clinical and imaging follow-ups to monitor their condition, complications are difficult to anticipate and may arise suddenly. For instance, participants with glioblastoma commonly demonstrate hypercoagulability, predisposing them to venous thromboembolism (VTE) with significant morbidity and mortality. VTE is a leading cause of death among cancer participants receiving outpatient chemotherapy, and timely detection and treatment can increase survival. Wearable sensors, in the form of direct-to-consumer devices, may allow for insights to allow for timely, proactive interventions. Nearly 20 percent of US residents own a smart wearable device such as the FitBit or Apple watch. Integration of wearable devices into clinical care has accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic's boost in the development of telehealth services. The increasing accessibility and affordability of wearable technology have also allowed for new possibilities to deliver remote and timely care to participants.

The sensors in consumer devices capture a wide range of information. Trans-dermal optical photoplethysmography provides cardiac and respiratory measurements using non-invasive blood flow data. Meanwhile, motion and spatial data are supplied by accelerometers and gyroscopes. This raw data can then be assembled to provide insight into biometric parameters ranging from step counts to higher level information (e.g. VO2 max and sleep duration). Prior work has already used this data at a higher level to link movement activity and vital signs to a patient's thrombosis risk but has not been done in the brain tumor population. This study will ask participants to wear an Apple watch and document any health events or symptoms. Patterns will be analyzed within the captured data that may be associated with symptoms. By annotating symptomatic episodes, study is aimed to generate contextualized wearable sensor datasets that do not currently exist for glioblastoma participants and develop digital biomarkers for certain symptoms. For instance, abnormal variations in heart rate or breathing rate will be observed preceding a seizure or other transient neurological symptoms. Wearable data uses the patient's baseline at the beginning of the study as a matched control. Traditional follow-up care and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) evaluation rely on snapshot measurements, patient interviews, and clinician impressions during a relatively brief clinic visit. Wearable sensors may provide higher resolution information to help determine KPS between visit assessment and interventions. Some studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using wearables for remote monitoring of KPS in advanced gastrointestinal and lung cancers, but have yet to include participants with glioblastoma. One feasibility study has explored wearables in determining sleep quality in glioblastoma participants. To understand the relationship between actigraphy data and clinical scores of well-being in participants with glioblastoma, investigators will examine the association between collected movement data and KPS. This is a feasibility study using the Apple Watch and an iOS application on the participant's iPhone to collect continuous actigraphy data and annotate symptom occurrence. Apple's open-source framework is being utilized to specifically design for medical research, ResearchKit, to build the app and securely collect data.",RECRUITING,,2024-04-30,2027-12,2025-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,25,ESTIMATED

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III esophageal cancer that can be removed by surgery.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin, floxuridine, docetaxel, and leucovorin calcium improves the rate of pathologic complete response in patients with previously untreated, resectable stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

Secondary

* Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the clinical response rates (complete response and partial response) in patients treated with this regimen.
* Evaluate thymidylate synthase (TS), mRNA gene expression, TS activity, and TS and mRNA sequence, to determine the altered spots as related to drug resistance in these patients.
* Evaluate the potential for genome-wide gene expression profiling to predict response to therapy, recurrence, progression-free survival, overall survival, and drug sensitivity and resistance in these patients.
* Define the role of 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) on translation and drug resistance in these patients.
* Evaluate, by bone marrow aspirate analysis and flow cytometry, the initial presence of cancer cells in the marrow, and clearance of these cells after treatment with this regimen.
* Evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.
* Assess quality of life of patients during and after treatment with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.

Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes, floxuridine IV over 24 hours, and leucovorin calcium IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo surgery after completion of chemotherapy. Patients who achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) receive no further chemotherapy.

Hypothesis 1: Women who participate in the CBSM intervention will have a larger primary and secondary antibody response to vaccines compared to women in the comparison group.

Hypothesis 2: Women who participate in a 10-week CBSM group intervention will report lower levels of distress immediately after and 6 months after the intervention compared to women in the comparison group.","Chronic stress can impair immune function, including immune response to vaccines. This has important implications for cancer control and prevention because tumor vaccines are emerging as tools for cancer treatment and prevention, and the cohort that would benefit from the vaccines is likely to be stressed. Women at elevated risk for breast cancer experience significant levels of distress that have been associated with immune function decrements. Interventions to treat distress-related immune decrements among these women are needed because these women will be among the first candidates for breast cancer vaccines. In theory, stress-management interventions should improve immune function and response to vaccines, but the findings to date are mixed, in part because most intervention studies have been done with medical patients who by nature have immune confounds. Thus, it is unknown how stress management interventions affect immune function in stressed but otherwise healthy people, such as women at elevated risk for breast cancer.

NCT01686594,PUVA Maintenance Therapy in Mycosis Fungoides,"A Multi-center, Randomized Study on Oral 8-methoxypsoralen Plus UVA With or Without Maintenance Therapy in Mycosis Fungoides EORTC/ISCL Stage IA to IIB",The purpose of the study is to determine whether psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) photochemotherapy maintenance treatment prolongs disease-free survival of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) patients.,"Background: Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) photochemotherapy consists of the topical or oral application of psoralen, followed by exposure to UVA light. PUVA is used in various conditions, including early stages of mycosis fungoides (MF) and other primary and secondary lymphoproliferative disorders. PUVA has strong pro-apoptotic and immunomodulating properties, but the exact mechanisms by which PUVA leads to clearance of MF are not well understood. Although MF is generally a slowly progressing disease, it ultimately can spread to lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood, and other organs, leading to death.

Previous Work: PUVA therapy is a well-accepted first-line treatment option for skin-limited MF (stages IA, IB, and IIA), leading to complete remission in a high portion of patients (approximately 70 to 90%). Long-term remissions can be achieved with PUVA in a certain percentage of patients. However, in most cases MF lesions relapse after stop of PUVA after variable time intervals with a median time to relapse of 14 to 17 month, according to our own experience. Not only is little is known about the therapeutic mechanisms of PUVA in MF but as little is known about optimal duration and frequency of treatment (2, 3, or 4 times weekly), dose escalation, and maintenance therapy. Although PUVA has been introduced more than 30 years ago, there is lack of prospective controlled studies with clearly defined dose schemes and also an ongoing controversy whether PUVA maintenance therapy may prolong disease remission in MF upon initial complete clearance.

Hypothesis \& Intended Work: We hypothesize that PUVA prolongs disease free survival in MF patients. In a randomized multicenter trial involving 9 centers in Austria, we plan to investigate (1) the clinical efficacy of PUVA and its maintenance therapy in MF and, (2) the mechanisms by which PUVA leads to disease clearance. In total, 82 patients will be enrolled and treated with a defined PUVA regimen with 2 exposures per week for 12 to 24 weeks. After 12 to 24 weeks of PUVA treatment, patients with complete remission will be randomized into two arms. In Arm A patients will be treated with PUVA maintenance therapy at constant single UVA doses. Maintenance treatment will be given once a week for one month (4 weeks), every 2 weeks for 2 months (8 weeks) and after three months once a month over 6 months. After 9 months of maintenance therapy patients will discontinue therapy. Patients in Arm B will receive no therapy. All patients will be followed until recurrence or at least 12 months (in non-recurrent patients) when the primary study analysis will be done. In addition, the follow-up will be extended to 60 months for long-term results.

The mechanistic action of PUVA will be studied by laboratory investigations, including immune function and cytokine analysis.

Outlook: A better understanding of the optimal regimen and the therapeutic mechanisms of PUVA in MF should help improving treatment strategies for this life-threatening disease. The understanding of the mode of action of PUVA in MF may also help to develop novel treatments using PUVA-affected pathways, allowing to achieve overall better long-term response and success.",COMPLETED,,2013-02,2018-07-02,2018-07-02,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,28,ACTUAL
NCT04694794,Diminish Chemotherapy Related Side Effects Through Patient Education,D-CRSE: Diminish Chemotherapy Related Side Effects Through Patient Education in Patients With Breast OR Gastrointestinal Cancer Who Are Undergoing Cytotoxic Chemotherapy,"Currently, there is a lack of patient education materials regarding cytotoxic chemotherapy side effects, research supported treatments, and the utilization of CAM by cancer patients at Penn State Cancer Institute. The investigators aim to develop an educational brochure, which educates patients about the chemotherapy side effects they may experience, and provide them with the tools to address the problem themselves, know when to contact their medical oncologist, and understand when it is appropriate to go to the Emergency Department. By educating patients regarding these problems, patient anxiety may decrease, the number of calls into the oncologist office may decrease, and Emergency Department visits may decrease, which would decrease costs for the patient, the hospital, and the health system. If this intervention is found to be useful and impactful, it can be further utilized within the Cancer Institute by other disease teams, by other Penn State institutions, or by other institutions across the country.","The diagnosis of cancer is a life-altering event which can cause a large amount of distress in patients. One of the several factors that impacts a patient's level of distress, is their fear of the diagnosis and their lack of information in the beginning their cancer journey. Understandably, many patients turn to easily accessible but disreputable resources, such as the internet, to learn and mentally prepare themselves for this journey. Friends and family members may also provide advice or recommendations which may not always be scientifically supported. Disreputable resources often have incorrect information that can scare or mislead a patient, which can severely impact their health and fight against cancer. In order to help patients fight these fears and become properly equipped for the cancer journey, care teams must address the education of patients, especially the education about the chemotherapy treatment process and potential side effects.

The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the utility of a brochure to educate breast and gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy about the side effects of treatment, in addition to providing them with tools and recommendations to lessen the impact of these side effects on their quality of life. A questionnaire-based approach and the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT) will be employed to evaluate participant's responses in a variety of domains, such as understandability, actionability, and utility of the brochure. The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) will be used to capture the specific chemotherapy side effects that each patient is experiencing throughout their treatment. Emotional Thermometer Scales (ETS) will be utilized to assess patients' feelings of depression, anxiety, anger, and distress at the beginning and end of their treatment. Survey questions will be utilized at interval time points (baseline plus 6 and 12 weeks) to evaluate the overall impact of the brochure on their quality of life and symptom management. All patients will receive the brochure and fill out the associated assessment scales and tools. The investigator's hypothesis is that a brochure providing information and tools to address the side effects of breast and gastrointestinal cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy will have utility in cancer clinics and allow patients to improve their quality of life by following the scientifically supported recommendations within the brochure.",COMPLETED,,2021-03-24,2023-08-21,2023-03-19,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,36,ACTUAL
