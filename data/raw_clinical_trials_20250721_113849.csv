NCT06375694,Probiotic Effect on Dietary Nitrate to Plasma Nitrite Production ( OPEDNPN ),Oral Probiotic Effect on Dietary Nitrate to Plasma Nitrite Production,"Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important molecule that is produced naturally in the body and that helps maintain healthy blood flow. Low availability of NO contributes to many diseases while administration of NO is therapeutic.

In addition to being made naturally in the body, NO can be obtained through the diet via the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle. Nitrate, which is abundant in green leafy vegetables and beetroot juice, is partially converted to nitrite by oral bacteria. The nitrate and nitrite are taken up into the blood and nitrite is converted into NO. Remaining nitrate in the blood is taken back up into the mouth by salivary glands and the cycle continues. Emerging studies suggest that the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle may contribute to cardiovascular health. In addition, there have been many studies where dietary nitrate is given to increase NO and treat various conditions.

The current study rests on the premise that the quality of the oral microbiome plays a major role in the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle and hence cardiovascular health and the efficacy of dietary nitrate interventions. Investigators have begun to identify oral bacterial species that are effective nitrite producers as well as though that are nitrite depleters (those that interfere with nitrite production from nitrate).

In laboratory experiments, certain bacterial species have been shown to block nitrate to nitrite conversion by other oral bacteria. These nitrite depleting species are found in a commercially available oral probiotic designed to improve oral health. The purpose of this study is to examine if use of the probiotic negatively affects the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle. Nitrate to Nitrite conversion will be assessed by measuring plasma levels of nitrite before and after consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice. Dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite conversion will assessed at baseline and after one week of consumption of the probiotic or a placebo (follow-up). The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants that consume the probiotic will have lower nitrate to nitrite conversion at follow-up compared to baseline and that there will be no significant change in nitrate to nitrite conversion between baseline and follow-up for participants who consume the placebo.

While this study does not aim to treat any specific disease, it is intended to elucidate a basic physiological function that may be relevant to cardiovascular health and certain NO-based therapeutics.","Background

Nitric oxide (NO) plays critical roles in a myriad of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology and function of various organs and systems.1,2 Low NO bioavailability contributes to pathology in multiple diseases including hemolytic anemias,3 malaria,4,5 transfusion of older stored blood,6,7 chronic heart failure,8 atherosclerosis,9 and diabetes.10 Recent reports suggest that the oral microbiome is linked with regulating NO homeostasis through the action of certain bacteria that have an ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite.11-15 Nitrite is then further reduced to NO through a variety of mechanisms in different tissues.16,17 Plasma nitrate is taken up back into the oral cavity by salivary glands so that the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle provides sustained increases in NO bioavailability. Many clinical studies have used dietary nitrate as a source of NO through nitrite conversion.18-24 However, there is substantial variability in the clinical outcomes due to dietary nitrate intake and this is reflected in variability in the amount of nitrate converted to plasma nitrite.13,24-29 30. The variability and hence a large overall limitation in efficacy of dietary nitrate based treatments has been attributed to the capacity of the oral microbiome to reduce nitrate to nitrite.24-27 Preliminary work has begun to identify bacterial strains that are efficient nitrate to nitrite converters as well as those that actually inhibit nitrate to nitrite conversion.31,32 The efficiency of the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle and the role of oral bacteria may contribute to normal health.11 Thus, understanding the variability in nitrate to nitrite conversion and aspects of the oral microbiome could lead to improvements in normal cardiovascular health. In addition, in order to maximize benefits from dietary nitrate interventions, we need to understand factors of the oral microbiome that affect nitrate to nitrite conversion. The investigators have recently discovered that several species of Lactobacillus produce a metabolite that blunts nitrate to nitrite conversion by other oral bacteria in vitro. Several of these Lactobacillus species are the main component of a commercially available oral probiotic, https://www.amazon.com/Dental-Probiotics-Breath-Gingivitis-Throat/dp/B096SZSFFS

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to determine if Lactobacillus will blunt dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite conversion.

The investigators hypothesize that the presence of oral Lactobacillus will blunt the conversion of dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite and will test this by comparing the conversion before and after use of this probiotic.

The main hypothesis rests on the auxiliary hypothesis that use of the oral probiotic will results in increased abundance of Lactobacillus in the oral cavity and will test this through genomic sequencing.

Methods OPEDNPN All eligible volunteers will be consented after learning about the study and agreeing to participate. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) Probiotic and (2) Placebo. A total of 20 volunteers (10 per group) will participate in the study. The only difference for participants for each group will be whether they receive the placebo or probiotic.

All volunteers will participate in two visits: (1) Visit 1, baseline and (2) Visit 2, follow up. At each visit, volunteers will report to the Olin Physical Lab room 208 after having fasted for 3 hours prior. They can drink water one hour before the visit. Participants will be instructed not to use anti-bacterial mouthwash the day of the visit. The participant will be asked to provide 4 mL of saliva and a study team member will collect a bacterial sample from the posterior dorsal surface of their tongue (as described below). These samples will be frozen at -80 degrees for genetic analysis and identification of bacterial strains.

After saliva and tongue samples are collected, blood will be drawn (as described below) for plasma nitrite and nitrate determination. This blood sample will be the ""pre-"" sample collected at baseline and follow-up. Volunteers will then drink one 70 mL Beet it Sport Nitrate 400 shot (https://www.beet-it.us/pages/beet-it-sports). A ""post-"" blood draw will be collected 2.5 hours after consumption of the beetroot juice.

At Visit 1, after the second blood draw, volunteers will receive 7 days worth of either probiotic or the placebo. Volunteers will consume the probiotic (or placebo) as indicated by the manufacturer of the probiotic once a day. On day 8, the volunteers will return for visit 2.

The data will include (1) baseline and follow-up analysis of oral bacterial strains and (2) Pre- and post-beet juice consumption plasma nitrite and nitrate levels. The investigators hypothesize that the abundance of Lactobacillus will be higher at follow-up compared to baseline for volunteers taking the probiotic but that there will be no change in the placebo group. The investigators also hypothesize that the change in plasma nitrite (post minus pre) will be lower at follow-up than at baseline for volunteers taking the probiotic but that there will be no change in the placebo group.

* Study Materials (all commercially available):

  1. Placebo: Honest Placebo Pills by Zeebo
  2. Herbiotics Oral + Ent Probiotic
  3. Beet it Sport Nitrate 400 shot
* Collection of Saliva and Tongue scraping. Volunteers will report to the Olin Physical Lab room 208 after having fasted for 3 hours prior. They can drink water one hour before the visit. Participants will be instructed not to use anti-bacterial mouthwash the day of the visit. The participant will be asked to provide 4 mL of saliva by spitting into a microcentrifuge tube. For the tongue samples, a HydraFlock 6"" Sterile Large Flock Swab w/Polystyrene Handle (Puritan Medical) will be used to collect scrapings. Volunteers will be asked to open their mouths as wide as possible and stick out their tongue. The posterior 1/3 of the dorsal surface of the tongue will be sampled by scraping lightly to moderately firmly the dorsal surface of the tongue back and forth Scraping will take a minute or so. The tongue scraping will be placed in 0.85 mL of buffered sterile saline and 0.15 mL glycerol. All samples will be frozen at -80°C and sent to Professor Hariom Yadav at the University of South Florida for genomic analysis.
* Blood draws and processing Blood will be drawn by a certified, trained phlebotomist. Blood samples (maximum \~10 mL) will be collected from participants following consent. Blood will be collected at each visit pre and 2.5 hours post beet juice consumption. Blood will be drawn as close to the 2.5 hour mark as possible. Realistically, it may occur between 2 to 3 hours after the final study beverage is consumed. Blood will be drawn by lab personnel with certified phlebotomy training via standard venipuncture methods or Tasso HemolinkTM device. The HemoLinkTM is an FDA-approved blood collection device that uses small lancets and gentle suction to collect a very small sample (\~ ¼ teaspoons) of blood. Blood will be collected in standard blood collection tubes (e.g. citrate (blue-top), EDTA (purple-top) and heparin (green-top)) and labeled appropriately. The preferred tube is a 4 mL heparin tube. All blood samples drawn for research purposes will be identified by the study participant number and date/time of collection, which will also be recorded on the standardized data collection form. No personal identifying information will be included on the samples processed for research purposes. All blood samples will be immediately spun immediately in a centrifuge at 600-800g for five minutes and the supernatant collected. The plasma will be frozen on dry ice and then stored at -80°C for analysis of nitrite and nitrate content.
* Probiotic or placebo consumption Both the probiotic and placebo will be consumed twice a day according to instructions for the probiotic. One capsule is chewed or allowed to melt in the volunteer's mouth and then the contents are switched around in the mouth before being swallowed.

Risks Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn from patients willing to participate. This will be done in the usual fashion, preparing the venipuncture site with the local anesthetic EMLA, then drawing blood through a small gauge (23 or 21) butterfly needle. Drawing blood from a vein may be associated with discomfort or bruising at the site of needle puncture. Rarely, fainting or infection at the site of needle puncture may occur. All blood will be drawn from a person trained in phlebotomy. There will be no way to trace the blood back to the donor.

There are no known health risks for donating saliva or tongue scrapings from individuals who will be included in the study. There is a very minimal risk of linking individuals to the study. There will be no way to trace the saliva or tongue scrapings back to the donor.

Protections Against Risk Strategies for protection against risk. To protect privacy of participants and confidentiality of research data, no personal information regarding individual participants will be linked to the in vitro studies.

Plans for medical attention. In case of injury (which is extremely unlikely) as a result of saliva donation, the individuals will be instructed to contact their physician and medical care will be offered and charged to available research coverage maintained at Wake Forest School of Medicine.

In case of injury as a result of blood drawing, the patients will be instructed to contact their physician and medical care will be offered and charged to available research coverage maintained at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Blood drawn on the Reynolda campus is not a clinical setting, but blood will be drawn by trained phlebotomists with years of experience who maintain their training.

Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes will be promptly reported by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency if appropriate.

Incidental Findings. No incidental findings are expected to be discovered in this study as measures of bacterial nitrate reduction are not currently of clinical relevance so a strange, individual result in that measure would not be worth communicating.

Sample size assessment and statistical analysis

The investigators plan to enroll 10 participants who receive the probiotic and 10 participants who receive the placebo. The investigators hypothesize that, using a paired t-test, participants taking the probiotic will have significantly (P \< .05) lower change in plasma nitrite (post minus pre) at follow up compared to baseline while there will be no significant effect of the placebo (paired t-test).

The Investigators calculated that they would have 80% power to measure a 75% decrease in the change in nitrite at follow-up compared to baseline for the probiotic group with 10 participants per group (Continuous endpoint Two independent samples). The investigators assumed a 60% standard deviation in the change in nitrite for follow-up vs baseline based on previous data from our lab.",RECRUITING,,2024-06-01,2025-05,2025-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,20,ESTIMATED

NCT01292694,Contribution of Angiotensin II to Supine Hypertension in Autonomic Failure,Contribution of Angiotensin II to Supine Hypertension in Autonomic Failure,"The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that angiotensin II plays a role in the supine hypertension of primary autonomic failure. To determine the contribution of angiotensin II to renin and blood pressure regulation in autonomic failure, patients with multiple system atrophy \[MSA\] or pure autonomic failure \[PAF\] and supine hypertension will undergo medication testing with the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan. The investigators will compare the biochemical and hemodynamic effects between MSA and PAF patients. In a subset of patients, the investigators will also give the ACE inhibitor captopril. Our primary endpoint will be changes in plasma renin activity, and subsequent components of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, in response to angiotensin II blockade. Our secondary outcome will be changes in hemodynamic measures during administration of these drugs.","Primary autonomic failure is a disabling condition characterized by orthostatic hypotension. It is less well appreciated that at least 50% of these patients have high blood pressure when lying down \[supine hypertension\]. The mechanisms underlying supine hypertension in autonomic failure remain poorly understood. The hypertension in MSA patients may be explained by residual sympathetic tone, possibly acting on hypersensitive adrenoreceptors and unrestrained by the lack of baroreflex modulation. In contrast, the hypertension in PAF is associated with increased vascular resistance in the absence of residual sympathetic tone. However, the factors driving an elevation in either sympathetic or vascular tone in these patients remain unclear.

The investigators hypothesize that angiotensin II, a hormone widely implicated in blood pressure regulation, plays a role in the supine hypertension of autonomic failure. To determine the contribution of angiotensin II to renin and blood pressure regulation in autonomic failure, the investigators will administer the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan to MSA and PAF patients with supine hypertension. The primary endpoint will be changes in plasma renin activity, and subsequent components of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, in response to angiotensin II blockade. The secondary outcomes will be the decrease in blood pressure and changes in heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance during administration of these drugs.

This study will also assess the effect that changing to Remodulin will have on patient satisfaction with their treatment and impact on quality of life.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a variety of diseases and syndromes. Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately leading to inactivity and death. The goal of PAH treatment is to lengthen survival time, to ameliorate symptoms of PAH and to improve health related quality of life (HRQOL).

Remodulin® (treprostinil sodium), a stable analogue of prostacyclin, possesses potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilatory and platelet anti-aggregatory actions in vitro and in vivo. Recently, Remodulin received FDA approval for intravenous therapy based upon bioequivalence of the IV and SC routes of administration. Remodulin is more chemically stable than epoprostenol and may offer potential safety and convenience advantages compared to intravenous epoprostenol that may impact Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and/or patient satisfaction. Unlike epoprostenol, Remodulin does not need to be mixed daily and is stable at room temperature eliminating the need for ice packs. Furthermore, since Remodulin remains in the body longer than epoprostenol (4 hrs instead of less than 5 minutes) there is less risk of cardiovascular collapse from a sudden interruption of infusion, such as a line clog. In an open-label study in Europe, patients who were using a type of portable medication pump called the CADD Legacy pump were rapidly switched from Flolan to Remodulin with no serious side effects. This study will examine effects of switching from therapy with epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin and compare changes in HRQOL and treatment satisfaction before and after rapid switch from epoprostenol to Remodulin in patients with pulmonary hypertension using the CADD legacy pump.

NCT04670094,Comorbidities and Risk Score in COVID-19 Patients,Comorbidities and Risk Score for Severity and Outcome in Patients With Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,Retrospective multi-center cohort study. Consecutive patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) up to October 2020 will be included. Patients are followed until discharge from hospital or death.,"Background

A virus causing clusters of severe pneumonia was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

This pathogen was designated as SARS-CoV-2. Although of probable zoonotic origin, human-to-human transmission has rapidly fuelled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally.

On February 20th, the first case of locally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in Northern Italy in a critically ill, hospitalized young man with no travel history to known areas of viral circulation or link to a probable or confirmed coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) case. Prior to this date, only three cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Central Italy, all with a travel history to Wuhan. Following this unexpected finding, case counts, and death tolls has increased rapidly in the country with a total of 192,994 confirmed cases and 25,969 deaths as of 24 April 2020.

Study rationale

Multiple variables have been described as possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, severity and prognosis, among which age, sex and comorbidities play an important role.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed the underlying medical conditions that have shown to increase the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2. While some comorbidities, such as serious heart conditions and chronic kidney disease have a consistent and strong evidence as bad prognostic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection, others as HIV have a limited evidence and heterogeneous results.

Further, despite it is well-known that the burden of co-existing diseases may be additive or even multiplicative, the effect of specific disease cluster on COVID-19 adverse outcomes has never been evaluated. Finally, the proposed models and risk scores currently available to predict disease severity and mortality are poorly reported and at high risk of bias, raising concern that their predictions could be unreliable when applied in daily practice. A reliable risk/prognostic score developed by a multidimensional and cross-validated approach will pave the way for future research on frail sectors of the population and on the use of health system resources. At the clinical level, a prognostic score will allow to predict severity and mortality risk in patients requiring hospitalization and to stratify patients according to clinical severity helping clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will confirm risk predictors already known and provide evidence for the uncertain ones. The investigators will also develop a prognostic score able to predict negative clinical outcomes (primarily short-term mortality), that will be useful to stratify patients at hospital admission according to their different risk profiles, and therefore to ""tailor"" the individuals' level of care.

A secondary objective could be that to extend this approach at the susceptible population level, especially the elders, to stratify according to the higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized and to have a dismal outcome (not developed here but related to a possible amendment).

Sample size

The investigators expect the total number of patients with complete data to be approximately 2500, based on the expected recruitment of each center.

Analysis Plan

Data will be summarized by counts and percentage and quartiles for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multi-state models will be used to describe patient's hospital mortality and discharge. In-hospital mortality will be estimate accounting for discharge as competing event. Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate mortality up to 3-months from admission. The role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome will be evaluated by the Cox model adjusting for relevant confounders. A clinically-based prognostic score will be developed including comorbidities and other risk factors. The score will be constructed by a multidimensional approach and Lasso approach will be used to select relevant risk factors. The Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) and Brier score will be used to evaluate model performance and the final score will be cross-validated. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a training and test validation approach. The use of regression trees for a practical definition of risk subgroups and latent variable models will also be considered.

Multiple imputation will be performed if missing would exceed 10%.

Data collection

Consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 up to October 2020 will be included. Given the difficulty in systematically obtaining written informed consent and given the great public interest of the project, the research will be conducted in the context of the authorizations guaranteed by Article 89 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU Regulation 2016/679, which guarantees processing for purposes of public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes of health data.",COMPLETED,,2020-12-30,2021-05-29,2021-05-29,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,4555,ACTUAL

The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of the implementation of a postpartum CVD prevention lifestyle program in women with a HDP as well as the transferability and fidelity of the Ottawa-based CardioPrevent® program to a centre in Calgary (following a ""Train the Trainer"" model). Secondary objectives include an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of this intervention on clinical outcomes and measures of microvascular function between study arms at one year.","1. Background and Rationale

   Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (i.e., coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Canada, particularly amongst women. Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) represent one of the highest-risk populations for premature CVD and CVD mortality. The 2011 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines on the prevention of CVD in women now include HDP as an independent CVD risk factor in the evaluation of CVD risk. To achieve ""ideal cardiovascular health"" targets, healthy lifestyle modifications are suggested as first-line therapy, with pharmacotherapy as second line. The immediate postpartum period may be an early window of opportunity for early upstream CVD prevention, capitalizing on a woman's increased motivation to improve her health. Despite these recommendations and opportunity for early CVD prevention, there is little published data, and, in particular, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the short-term or long-term effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in women with HDP.

   To address this important clinical problem and knowledge gap, the interdisciplinary IMPROVE team adapted the evidence-based University of Ottawa Heart Institute CardioPrevent® Lifestyle program to proactively address the unique barriers to, and facilitators of behaviour change in early postpartum women with HDP. Prior to undertaking a widespread evaluation of CardioPrevent® in a CVD prevention study for women with HDP, a pre-assessment of the feasibility of this postpartum lifestyle program using this research approach through a pilot study is essential. In addition, this pilot study will provide important information on CardioPrevent®'s effectiveness on modifying clinically-important cardiovascular-related clinical outcomes and novel, non-invasive measures of microvascular function in early postpartum women with HDP to inform the design of a larger CVD prevention study. This pilot RCT will be the first to assess the feasibility and effects of a one-year postpartum-specific CVD prevention lifestyle program in women with a HDP.
2. Research Questions \& Objectives

   The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of the implementation of a postpartum CVD prevention lifestyle program in women with a HDP as well as the transferability and fidelity of the Ottawa-based CardioPrevent® program to a centre in Calgary (following a ""Train the Trainer"" model). Secondary objectives include: an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of this intervention on clinical outcomes and measures of microvascular function between study arms at one year.
3. Methods

Study Design: A 2-year, single centre, single-blind, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Study Population (Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria): Women with a HDP (i.e., preeclampsia, eclampsia or gestational hypertension) delivering at the Foothills Medical Centre will be invited to participate. Women with pre-existing chronic hypertension, diabetes (type 1 or type 2), kidney disease or cardiovascular disease (coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial) will be excluded.

Intervention: CardioPrevent® Program - a one year, evidence-based cardiovascular prevention program that consists of 25 contacts (either in person or by phone) with a trained behaviour change counsellor to facilitate desired lifestyle behaviours within the participants' own social context.

Control: Standard clinical postpartum care. All Participants: Participants in both arms will receive educational material about the risk of CVD and CVD prevention for women with HDP from the Preeclampsia Foundation.

Sample size: A total of 84 women will be recruited (42 in each arm). Recruitment \& Retention: There are over 7000 deliveries per year at the FMC. Using a conservative estimate of 7% prevalence of HDP (as it is a tertiary care referral centre), approximately 245 women (10 per week) will have HDP over our 6-month recruitment period. The investigators anticipate recruiting 2-3 eligible women per week to reach the target sample size in 6 months. To minimize loss to follow-up, they plan to use participant incentives such as covering the costs of parking and childcare.",UNKNOWN,,2019-09,2019-11,2019-11,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,OTHER,84,ESTIMATED

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of frequent home (HBPM)- and 24 hour (ABPM) blood pressure measurements to achieve BP control in patients with essential hypertension according to Danish Society of Hypertension Gudelines. The study will include 120 general practioners (GP) randomised to perform either usual BP control or intensive BP control. Before randomization, participating GPs will recruit each 10 patients to be followed over a period of 12 months. At baseline ABPM will be measured in all eligible patients. The result of the baseline ABPM will be blinded in the usual care group. Following this, usual care (control) physicians will perform BP control according to their usual standard. Physicians randomized to intensive care will control BP by the use of frequent HBPM and ABPM. According to a pre-specified scheme patients followed by intensive care physicians will measure HBP in the morning and in the evening at three consecutive days after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 months in the study. Patients will communicate the results of these measurements to the treating physician, who according to the result of the HBPM will decide what action to take. As a further aid, at 6 month patients in the intensive care group will have another APBM as part of the follow up to ensure 24 hour BP control. In both the usual- and intensive care group all treatment decisions is entirely up to the treating physician. No pre-specified treatment algorithm has to be followed and both non-pharmacological as well as any pharmacological tretment can be used to (optimize) BP control. Patients followed by intensive care will receive extended structured information about the importance of optimal BP control. As the primary endpoint is change in mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure patients in both groups will have a ABPM after 12 months. During the whole trial, participating physicians will keep a record of all measured BP (clinic BP, HBP and ABP), as well as all relevant blood- and urinary tests (lipids, glucose, albuminuria) taken during the study. Based on all available information, patients total risk score (Danish Society of Hypertension) will be calculated at baseline and after 12 months.

Study Hypothesis:

Blood pressure control according to the Danish Society of Hypertension Guidelines is better obtained by an intensive care regimen (frequent home- and ambulatory blood pressure measurement) compared to a usual care regimen (standard blood pressure control in Danish general practice).

Comparison(s):

Frequent home- and ambulatory blood pressure measurements versus standard care.",COMPLETED,,2005-11,2007-06,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,1000,

NCT00099476,Effects of Dark Chocolate on Insulin Sensitivity in People With High Blood Pressure,Effects of Cocoa Consumption on Insulin Sensitivity and Capillary Recruitment in Subjects With Essential Hypertension,"This study will examine whether dark chocolate affects the way patients with hypertension (high blood pressure) respond to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates blood glucose (sugar) levels. In many people with hypertension, insulin is not as effective in helping the body use glucose. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin also increases blood flow into muscle by opening inactive blood vessels. Laboratory studies suggest that eating dark chocolate may improve blood pressure. This study will determine whether dark chocolate improves insulin resistance or changes how blood vessels react to insulin in hypertensive people.

People between 21 and 65 years of age who have high blood pressure and are not pregnant may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.

Participants refrain from eating foods containing chocolate or cocoa for 1 week and then come to the clinic on three separate occasions 3 weeks apart for a glucose clamp test and contrast ultrasound, described below. At the first glucose clamp test, subjects are randomly assigned to drink either a cocoa drink with high anti-oxidant content or one with a very low content of anti-oxidant. Each drink will be taken twice a day for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks, they return for a second glucose clamp test. At the second test, they stop taking the cocoa drink for 1 week and then start again for another 2 weeks. For this 2-week period, those who were given the high anti-oxidant content cocoa drink the first 2 weeks will take the placebo, very low anti-oxidant drink this time, and those who took the placebo will now have the high anti-oxidant cocoa drink. After this 2 weeks of taking the cocoa drink or placebo, they then take the third and last glucose clamp test.

Glucose clamp test: This test measures how the body responds to insulin. Subjects fast the night before each test and do not eat until the test is over, usually in the early afternoon. For the test, the subject lies in a bed or reclines in a chair. A needle is placed in a vein in each arm - one for collecting blood samples and the other for infusing glucose, insulin, and a potassium solution. Blood glucose and insulin levels are measured frequently during the test and the rate of the glucose infusion is adjusted to keep blood glucose at the baseline (fasting) level. Blood samples are tested for blood count, electrolytes, liver function...","Dark chocolate and other cocoa products contain antioxidants including the polyphenol epicatechin that have beneficial effects on vascular function. Oral consumption of dark chocolate lowers blood pressure in elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension while drinking cocoa acutely improves flow-mediated vasodilation in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors. Work from our lab and elsewhere has shown that regulation of hemodynamic and metabolic homeostasis are coupled such that subjects with essential hypertension are also insulin resistant. Therefore, we hypothesize that cocoa consumption will improve both blood pressure and insulin sensitivity in subjects with essential hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized double-blind, crossover study in subjects with essential hypertension to evaluate the effects of cocoa versus placebo on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and insulin-mediated capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle. After a 7 day cocoa-free run-in period, subjects will be randomized to receive 15 consecutive daily doses of either cocoa drink (150 ml twice a day with a total of 900 mg of polyphenols and 237 kcal) or polyphenol poor placebo drink (150 ml twice a day with a total of 36 mg of polyphenols and 234 kcal). After the 15 day treatment period, the subjects will enter a 1 week cocoa-free washout period followed by cross-over to the other treatment. Subjects will be counseled to maintain an isocaloric diet during the study. Blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and insulin-mediated capillary recruitment will be assessed in each subject after the run-in period, after 15 days of treatment, and after completion of the cross-over. Blood pressure will also be measured every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the duration of the study. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique. Insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment in forearm skeletal muscle will be measured by ultrasound with ""microbubble"" contrast during the glucose clamp studies. Peak and trough plasma epicatechin levels will be measured prior to each glucose clamp study using an HPLC assay. This study will determine if short-term oral administration of cocoa is effective at lowering blood pressure, improving insulin sensitivity, and restoring vascular function in subjects with essential hypertension.

In order to detect early development of cardiovascular disease, early detection of the endothelium of obese adolescents is needed. Endothelium dysfunction is an early stage of developing atherosclerosis, which can be a predictor of cardiovascular disease development in the future. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) is a non-invasive method that can measure endothelium function and predict the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is not only able to measure artery diameter, but also provides function index of nitric oxide (NO) in the endothelium. FMD is negatively related to BMI. Meanwhile, Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, because when its levels increase, ET-1 can cause a condition of hyperinsulinemia. ET-1 was found to be high in patients with cardiovascular disorders, as well as in obese and diabetic subjects. Alternative methods for assessing endothelial function by measurement of biomarkers of activation and endothelial dysfunction such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1). Levels of sICAM-1 have been found to be related positively to age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and inversely to estrogen. Furthermore, associations have been found between sICAM-1 and cardiovascular mortality in both healthy individuals and populations at high risk.

The aim of the study was to evaluate FMD, concentrations of ET-1 and sICAM-1 in adolescents with a presence of obesity and hypertension and to compare these with controls (obesity and non hypertension), as well as to analyze the correlations between FMD, ET-1, sICAM-1 and blood pressure values.","This study is cross sectional study with observational analytic that evaluates FMD, ET-1 dan sICAM-1 in obese adolescents with hypertension compared to obese adolescents without hypertension and normal adolescents.

This is a non interventional study.","Preeclampsia (PE) is a condition which affects approximately 2% of all pregnancies and can be a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity/mortality (2). The suspected underlying mechanism of PE is thought to be impaired trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries leading to impaired placental perfusion, placental ischemia and subsequent development of endothelial dysfunction (3). There is evidence that PE, which is commonly associated with fetal growth restriction, can be predicted effectively at 11-13 weeks gestational age by combined screening algorithms combining uterine artery pulsatility index (PI), maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and maternal serum concentrations of placental products including but not limited to plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and placental growth factor (PLGF) (4-6).

Specifically,the investigators are interested in patients diagnosed with high blood pressure during their pregnancy, as compared with normal pregnant patients. A noninvasive, accurate method of taking these measurements in pregnant patients is not currently available.","During pregnancy, many aspects of blood circulation, such as blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and stroke volume, adapt to accommodate the increasing needs of a pregnant body. The circulatory system works harder to provide blood flow to the placenta and the growing fetus.

Currently, the devices that can give physicians detailed information on the status of the blood circulation of normal patients and those with high blood pressure during pregnancy are invasive to varying degrees. However, recently, a new noninvasive hemodynamic monitor (NonInvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring: NICOM) was introduced to the market. In studies with non-pregnant patients, the NICOM has been found to be accurate, precise and reliable. However, it has yet to be studied in the field of Obstetrics.

The purpose of this study is to find out if the NICOM is an effective tool for monitoring hemodynamic changes in pregnant women, both with normal and high blood pressure. We are planning to compare the hemodynamic profiles of normal pregnant patients, hypertensive pregnant patients, and non pregnant patients as a control group. If this monitor proves to be reliable in assessing these changes in the pregnant patients, this could have a great impact in optimizing the care of the patients with different medical conditions in pregnancy, such as increased blood pressure.",COMPLETED,,2009-07,2009-12,2009-12,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,30,ACTUAL

It is designed to determine whether using natriuretic peptide measurement as a screening tool following a general cardiovascular risk factor screen will reduce the prevalence and severity of ventricular dysfunction in conjunction with specialist follow-up at St. Vincent's University Hospital.","A large proportion of the population has substantial left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and do not have symptoms (Stage B heart failure). For many of these patients, if identified and treated appropriately, it is possible to prevent the subsequent development of heart failure (HF). Although the current gold standard for detection of LVD is echocardiography, it is expensive and impractical for mass screening.

Natriuretic peptides are attractive candidates for screening populations for asymptomatic LVD particularly because of high negative predictive values. Furthermore, some studies have shown that, in the right setting, screening with natriuretic peptides might prove cost effective in combination with echocardiography for patients with elevated levels.

However, in common with many accepted screening strategies, there are no randomised studies which show that screening the population with natriuretic peptides for asymptomatic LVF alters the natural history of the condition.

From a large, community based cardiovascular risk screening programme including more than 13,000 patients, patients in the catchment area of St Vincent's University Hospital are invited to participate in the STOP-HF study. The objective of this work is to determine whether or not using natriuretic peptide screening in conjunction with specialist follow-up will reduce the prevalence and severity of LVD in a well-defined, at-risk, primary care population. It also aims to: evaluate the natural history of natriuretic peptides over time in this population; to clarify optimal screening cut-offs for the detection of LVD; to evaluate the clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, genetic and proteomic determinants of natriuretic peptides in this setting; to determine whether the clinical benefits of the STOP HF screening programme, if any, are cost effective.

The study design is prospective, randomised and parallel group.

The primary endpoint is the prevalence and severity LVD after 5 years of follow up. Secondary endpoints include: the natural history of natriuretic peptides; the relationship between natriuretic peptides and severity of LVD, death, hospital admissions; clinical, demographic, biochemical, pharmacological, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic determinants of natriuretic peptides; screening cost-effectiveness.

Participants who fulfill entry criteria at baseline will sign an informed consent and will be randomised onto the Usual Care or Intervention Care arm of the study. Usual care is defined as continued management of the patient by the primary care services using standard risk factor monitoring and intervention strategies. Intervention Care is defined as a collaborative cardiovascular management between primary care and specialist hospital based services. All participants will receive an intensive education session from a cardiovascular nurse on their risk factors and advice on healthy dietary and lifestyle habits.

There will be 2 years of enrollment with annual review and 5 years of follow-up to the primary endpoint. Permission has been received to extend the follow up period to 10 years. Regardless of randomisation, all patients receive full clinical and laboratory assessment at baseline and on completion of the STOP HF study (year 5). Additionally, all participants will receive echocardiography assessment during and at the conclusion of the study.

Data collection:

Data will be collected on all participants regarding their medical history and current medications. The source of data collection will be from medical records kept at the primary care practices and from patient interview. All participants will receive a booklet in which they will be asked to record any visits to their primary care practitioner, alterations in medications, new diagnoses and hospital admissions. Local hospital discharge records will be screened to detect any events throughout the course of the study.

Clinical Assessment:

At annual intervals, the cardiovascular research nurse will conduct clinical assessments on all participants including weight, abdominal girth measurement, blood pressure (triplicate measurements while lying in supine position), heart rate and observe for evidence of limb oedema. The nurse will also question the participants to investigate for symptoms of dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, orthopnoea, palpitations and fatigue.

Blood sampling and handling:

Peripheral venous blood samples will be drawn on all participants at annual intervals. Samples to assess natriuretic peptides will be drawn into vacutainers containing EDTA and samples to assess renal function, collagen turnover and lipid profile will be collected in vacutainers containing lithium heparin. BNP and Lipid profile assessment will be analysed using point of care meters, Biosite (Triage, USA) and Cholestech respectively. Each of the remaining samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes and the serum will be then aliquoted and stored at -80°C before analysis of biochemical, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic markers.

Echocardiographic Doppler analysis:

Two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, targeted M-mode and Doppler ultrasound measurements will be obtained in each patient. M-mode measurements are taken according to the guidelines laid down by the American Society of Echocardiography. All echocardiographic data will represent the mean of 3 measurements on different cardiac cycles.

NCT01296594,Improving Antihypertensive Medication Adherence,Improving Antihypertensive Medication Adherence,"Poor adherence to antihypertensive medications is associated with morbidity, and data suggest that substance abuse may contribute to poor adherence. Contingency management (CM), an intervention highly efficacious for improving outcomes of substance abusers, shows promise in improving medication adherence in a handful of small trials. CM involves providing tangible reinforcement each time the behavior (medication ingestion) is exhibited. Thus far, studies evaluating CM for increasing medication adherence have utilized MEMS caps, but reinforcement of adherence via MEMS caps is done relatively infrequently and with delay, hindering its efficacy. A widely utilized technology that may be more appropriate for reinforcing medication adherence is cell phones, which can record the process of pill ingestion through video functions. As regular monitoring and feedback is important in the efficacy of CM, patients can be provided with daily messages regarding adherence and CM earnings. In this pilot study, we propose to randomize 40 hypertensive substance abusing patients with suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medications to one of two 12-week treatment conditions: (1) usual care, or (2) usual care with cell phone monitoring and CM. In the CM condition, patients will carry a cell phone and record and send in time- and date-stamped self videos of medication ingestion. These patients will receive congratulatory messages or reminders about adherence, and they will earn vouchers each time medication ingestion occurs at the appropriate time, along with bonuses for sustained adherence. We hypothesize that the CM condition will improve self report and pill count measurements of medication adherence and that it will result in decreased blood pressure. Results from this study may have widespread implications for the use of cell phones as a novel technology to improve medication adherence.",,COMPLETED,,2011-02,2012-07,2012-07,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,30,ACTUAL

National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred caloric replacement strategy for SSBs. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and blood pressure in randomized trials. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk. Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.","Rationale:

Soy is at a nutritional ""cross-roads"". On one hand, it aligns with current dietary advice to consume plant-based dietary patterns \[1-6\] and has proven advantages \[7-9\]. On the other hand, it is under threat to have its health claim for CHD risk reduction revoked \[10\] and is often overshadowed by dairy in public health interventions for metabolic health. Strategies to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) have become one of the leading public health targets to address the epidemics of obesity and diabetes \[10-22\]. National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred replacement strategy for SSBs \[23-27\]. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies \[28,29\] and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and BP in randomized trials \[30\]. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives, which have shown distinct advantages over cow's milk for intermediate metabolic outcomes \[7,31-33\], is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the metabolic benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk.

Objective:

Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.

Design:

The trial will be a 6-month, 2-phase, 3-arm, non-inferiority, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of replacing SSBs with 2% soy milk versus 2% cow's milk on the primary outcome liver fat and secondary outcomes muscle fat, insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, glucose tolerance and established cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who are consuming ≥3 SSBs/day. The trial will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and reported according to CONSORT and the COSORT extension for non-inferiority trials \[34\]. The 3-arm design has the advantage of combing a superiority trial with a non-inferiority trial, by allowing us to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and reference (2% cow's milk) treatments over the control (SSBs) and the noninferiority of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment simultaneously. We chose a treatment duration of 24-weeks as this was the duration over which milk was shown to reduce liver fat in replacement for SSBs \[30\] and is a duration that will have a meaningful impact on public health policy \[35,36\].

Participants:

We will include186 overweight or obese (BMI, 27-40 kg/m2) adult (age, 18-75 years) men and nonpregnant women with MetS based on modified IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAAS/IASO \[37\] criteria (high waist circumference \[≥88cm females, ≥102cm males\] plus ≥2 of 4 dysglycemia \[FPG ≥5.6mmol/L\], high triglycerides \[≥1.7mmol/L\], low HDL-C \[\<1.0mmol/L males and \<1.3 mmol/L females\], or high blood pressure \[≥130/85mmHg\]) who are consuming ≥3 SSBs/day. We have modified the MetS definition to require a high WC to ensure the sample is enriched with participants with NAFLD (defined as hepatic steatosis/intrahepatocellular lipid \[IHCL\] by 1H-MRS ≥5.0%) \[38\]. We anticipate \> 50% of the sample will have NAFLD based on our entry criteria \[38,39\]. We will exclude individuals with diabetes or major illness.

Randomization:

The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) will perform block randomization with allocation concealment through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) program. Following successful completion of the run-in phase, participants will be randomized into 3 groups from each strata, using random permuted blocks with unequal sizes.

Protocol:

The trial will be conducted at the CFI-funded Toronto 3D Clinical Research Centre and MRI Research Unit and at the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Centre at St. Michael's Hospital. Eligible participants will undergo a 4-week run-in phase prior to randomization. Participants who wish to continue will then undergo a 24-week intervention phase in which they are randomized (see above) to 1 of 3 interventions: ≥3 servings of (1) 2% soy milk (test treatment), (2) 2% cow's milk (reference treatment/positive control) or (3) their usual SSBs (negative control). All study beverages will be provided with the instruction to replace usual SSBs intake while maintaining background diets. Participants will attend clinic visits every 4-weeks for review of beverage logs, collection of study foods, and clinical assessments of weight, waist circumference \[40\], and blood pressure. 1H-MRS measurements and 75g oral glucose tolerance tests (75g-OGTT; World Health Organization protocol \[41\]) with blood samples at -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes will be performed at 0 and 24 weeks as will collection of the Harvard Willett FFQ), and blood and fecal samples. Adherence biomarker samples will be collected at 0, 12, and 24 weeks.

Interventions:

The 3 interventions will consist of ≥3 servings of (1) 2% soy milk (Alpro Soya, 250mL single-serve shelf-stable packs, 100Kcal with 8g soy protein per 250mL), (2) 2% cow's milk (Organic Meadows®, 250mL, single-serve shelf-stable packs, 130Kcal with 8g casein/whey protein per 250mL), or (3) usual SSBs (355mL single-serve cans, 130-140kcal per 355mL). The participant's usual level of intake of SSBs will determine the dose (number of servings), providing a range of doses (that is, ≥ 3-servings or 24g protein for the soy and cow's milk) for dose response analyses. Although the soy and milk interventions will be matched for protein and serving size, we intentionally did not make the 3 interventions isocaloric, as the goal was to use ""real-world"" product substitutions.

Outcomes:

All outcome assessments will be blinded and assessed as the end value at week 24. The primary outcome will be liver fat (intrahepatocellular lipid \[IHCL\]) by 1H-MRS). Secondary outcomes will include change from baseline at week 24 of 75g-OGTT derived changes in insulin sensitivity (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index \[ISI\] \[42\]), beta-cell function (insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 \[ISSI-2\]) \[43,44\], and glucose tolerance (2hPG, iAUC). Exploratory outcomes will include ectopic muscle fat (intramyocellular lipid \[IMCL\]), continuous MetS criteria (waist circumference \[WC\], FPG, triglycerides \[TG\], HDL-C, and blood pressure \[BP\]), reversion of MetS (defined as a reversion to \<3 of 5 IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAAS/IASO criteria \[37\]; diabetes incidence (Diabetes Canada 2018 FPG, 2h-PG (75g-OGTT), or HbA1c criteria), and body weight, gut microbiome diversity (16S rRNA sequencing), markers of NAFLD (liver enzymes \[ALT, AST, GGT, ALP\], fatty liver index (FLI) \[45\]), hepatic insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), inflammation (hs-CRP), uric acid, established lipid targets (LDL-C, non-HDL-C), and diet quality (Alternative Healthy Eating Index \[AHEI\] using the Harvard Willett FFQ \[46\]). Adherence outcomes will include study beverage logs and objective biomarkers of intake of soy milk (urinary isoflavonoid excretion \[UIE\]\[47\]), cow's milk (dairy-derived serum fatty acids \[15:0, 17:0, CLA, trans-palmitoleic acid\]\[48\]), and SSBs (isotopic ratios of 13C/12C in serum fatty acids \[49\]).Other post hoc exploratory outcomes will be decided based on the availability of funding.

Data Management:

The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC), St. Michael's Hospital, will manage the digital database (REDCap) securely and ensure data integrity. This independent third party data management will be an important strength, bringing a high degree of credibility to the research.

Power:

A total of 186 participants will be randomized. N=62 per group will allow us to test the non-inferiority of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment with a non-inferiority margin (δ) of 75% of the effect of the reference treatment on the primary outcome ntra-hepatocellular lipid (IHCL) by 1H-MRS (1.5% absolute difference in IHCL based on a 75% preserved fraction of an expected 2% absolute difference in IHCL) by difference of means \[57\], assuming an SD of 3%, α=0.05, 80% power (β=0.20), and 20% attrition. A 2% absolute difference in IHCL was chosen as it is the minimum mean difference associated with clinically meaningful changes in downstream glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and/or blood lipids \[51-56\]. A non-inferiority margin (δ) of 75% was selected based on guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency \[58-60\]. This sample size will provide us ample power to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and the reference (2% cow's milk) treatments compared with the control (SSBs) treatment assuming the same 2% absolute difference in IHCL, SD of 3%, α=0.05, 80% power (β=0.20), and 20% attrition. It will also provide us with sufficient power for superiority testing of the secondary outcomes.

Statistical analysis:

All statistical analyses will be conducted using STATA 14 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) or a suitable statistical software package on end values at week-24 . The 3-arm design of the trial is intended to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and reference (2% cow's milk) treatments compared with the control treatment (SSBs) and the noninferiority of the active treatment (2% soy milk) compared with the reference treatment (2% cow's milk).

The testing of the primary outcome will be done in a stepwise manner to decrease the familywise error rate. We will first undertake superiority testing of the active treatment (2% soy milk) and the reference treatment (2% cow's milk) compared with the control treatment (SSB). The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle with inverse probability weighting (IPW) \[https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2215\] to account for missing values. Data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with significance set at a p \< 0.05. Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, per protocol, and ITT with multiple imputations (MI). If superiority is established in the primary analysis (confirming the ""assay sensitivity""), then we will undertake non-inferiority testing of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment using per protocol analysis. If the upper bound of the 90% CI is less than the 1.5% non-inferiority margin \[δ\] by difference of means, then the active treatment (2% soy milk) will be considered non-inferior to the reference treatment (2% cow's milk). If the upper bound of the 90% CI of the difference of means is less than both the 1.5% non-inferiority margin \[δ\] and the 0 value (unity), then the active treatment (2% soy milk) will be considered superior to the reference treatment (2% cow's milk). The primary analysis for non-inferiority will be a per protocol analysis. Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, ITT with IPW and ITT with MI.

Secondary, exploratory, and adherence outcomes will be assessed by superiority testing among the active treatment (2% soy milk), reference treatment (2% cow's milk), and control treatment (SSB).By reporting all estimated effects and confidence intervals with p-values, the necessary context is provided for a proper interpretation of the statistical evidence \[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108\]. If it is required for a future regulatory submission, then the secondary outcomes will be adjusted for false discovery. The approach will depend on the results of the primary outcome. If the superiority testing of the primary outcome is significant, then we will analyze the secondary outcomes using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling method with a starting alpha of 0.05 to correct for false discovery \[80\]. The sample size was selected to allow sufficient power for this analytical approach. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle with IPW to account for any missing values. Data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models for continuous data (mean differences with 95% CIs) and logistic regression models for categorical data (odds ratio with 95% CI for MetS reversion and relative risk with 95% CI for diabetes incidence). Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level of the end value. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, per protocol analyses, and ITT with MI.

Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted using Chi-square tests by age, sex, NAFLD status, caffeinated beverage use (cola vs non-cola drinkers), intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline waist circumference, FPG, 2hPG, Triglycerides, HDL-C, BP. Continuous linear (dose response gradient ) and non-linear (dose response threshold) dose-response analyses will be undertaken over the natural dose response range (3, 4, 5, or 6 servings per day) by multiple linear regression and piecewise regression analyses, respectively.

NCT04723160,Computer Aided Diagnosis of Multiple Eye Fundus Diseases From Color Fundus Photograph,"A Prospective, Multicenter, Blinded Reading, Self Controlled, Superiority Priority Clinical Trial of Assisted Fundus Image Diagnosis Software for the Diagnosis of Multiple Eye Fundus Diseases","Blindness can be caused by many ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia and glaucoma. Without timely diagnosis and adequate medical intervention, the visual impairment can become a great burden on individuals as well as the society. It is estimated that China has 110 million patients under the attack of diabetes, 180 million patients with hypertension, 120 million patients suffering from high myopia and 200 million people over 60 years old, which suggest a huge population at the risk of blindness. Despite of this crisis in public health, our society has no more than 3,000 ophthalmologists majoring in fundus oculi disease currently. As most of them assembling in metropolitan cities, health system in this field is frail in primary hospitals. Owing to this unreasonable distribution of medical resources, providing medical service to hundreds of millions of potential patients threatened with blindness is almost impossible.

To solve this problem, this software (MCS) was developed as a computer-aided diagnosis to help junior ophthalmologists to detect 13 major retina diseases from color fundus photographs. This study has been designed to validate the safety and efficiency of this device.","As a prospective clinical trial, This study enjoys multicentric, blind film reading, self-control and superiority test design. In total, 1,500 retinal fundus images from 750 individuals in need of fundus examination (one image for every single eye) were selected. Then a test group, along with a control group was set up in our study. For the test group, ophthalmologists read images with the aid of the assistant software(MCS). In contrast, the same work in the control group was finished by ophthalmologists independently. Meanwhile, the gold standard were obtained from the cooperation of senior ophthalmologists. Diagnoses of both groups were compared with those of the gold standard, thus the investigators could evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this assistant software in diagnosis.

The primary endpoint of this study is the superiority of the consistency rate of the test group. A diagnosis for an image is consistent if it gives the same negative result as the reference standard, or reveals any one condition indicated by the reference standard. The consistency rate is the rate of consistent diagnoses for all the involved images. One control group is designed, where each doctor reads and diagnoses, and give at most 3 possible conditions for each image. In the test group, doctors do the same thing with the help of this software. The investigators in the test group and control group are the same and they are chosen from ophthalmologists with 1\~3 years experience. The reference standard of each fundus image is collaboratively given by retinal specialists/fellows from 5 centers. The investigator of XieHe center is the arbitrator if full consensus cannot be reached for any image during the building of reference standard.",COMPLETED,,2020-08-10,2021-05-30,2021-03-10,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,748,ACTUAL

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors. They usually form inside and near the adrenal gland or in the neck region. Not all these tumors can be removed with surgery, and there are no good treatments if the disease has spread. Researchers think a new drug may be able to help.

Objective:

To learn the safety and tolerability of Lu-177-DOTATATE. Also, to see if it improves the length of time it takes for the cancer to return.

Eligibility:

Adults who have an inoperable tumor of the study cancer that can be detected with Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

Eligible participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center.

Participants will get the study drug in an intravenous infusion. They will get 4 doses, given about 8 weeks apart.

Between 4 and 24 hours after each study drug dose, participants will have scans taken. They will lie on their back on a scanner table.

Participants will have vital signs taken. They will give blood and urine samples.

During the study, participants will have other scans taken. Some scans will use a radioactive tracer.

Participants will complete quality of life questionnaires.

Participants will be contacted by phone 1-3 days after they leave the Clinical Center. They will then be followed every 3 to 6 months for 3 years or until their disease gets worse.","Background:

* Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) are rare tumors arising from neural crest tissue that can develop in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia throughout the body. Those arising in the adrenal gland are called PHEOs while those located extra-adrenally are called PGLs.
* While benign and uni-focal, PHEO/PGL can be effectively treated with surgical resection, participants with metastatic PHEO/PGL often times have few effective and efficient treatment options with current treatments aimed more at palliation and symptom control. Furthermore, some benign head and neck PGLs may be inoperable because of their size and location.
* Somatostatin receptors (SSTR), especially type 2, have been shown to be over-expressed in a number of human tumors, including gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), carcinoids, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and PHEO/PGL among many others.
* Ionizing radiation such as the beta particles emitted by Lu-177 cause DNA damage to target cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In addition, ionizing radiation has also been shown to induce cell death through what is known as the bystander effect, a phenomenon where cellular signaling from irradiated cells towards non-irradiated cells induces cellular damage and eventually death in nearby surrounding cells.
* Lu-177-DOTATATE is a somatostatin analog that predominantly recognizes SSTR2. This reagent has been used extensively and its well-tolerated safety profile and efficacy has been shown in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors.

Primary Objective:

To assess the safety and to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-DOTATATE to improve upon progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months in participants with inoperable, SSTR positive PHEO/PGL by comparing PFS of participants treated with Lu-177-DOTATATE to historical controls from existing literature.

Eligibility:

* Histologically-proven, surgically inoperable, PHEO/PGL participants (both newly diagnosed or participants with existing diagnoses are eligible)
* Must have presence of SSTR+ disease as documented by positive Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan

  * Positivity of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan defined as having at least one lesion that is greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter with uptake that is higher than or equal to liver and is qualitatively higher and distinguishable from background activity.
  * Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1
* Age: greater than or equal to 18
* Karnofsky Performance Score greater than or equal to 60 or, ECOG Performance Status of 2 or better
* Able to understand and willing to sign informed consent

Design:

* Open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of Lu- 177-DOTATATE in the selected participant population divided into two cohorts: 1) SDHx cohort will include participants with the succinate dehydrogenase mutation, which is the most common and most aggressive genetic sub-group of participants with PHEO/PGL, and 2) apparent sporadic cohort which will include participants without a clear genetic mutation.
* Lu-177-DOTATATE is administered IV every 8 (+/- 2) weeks, for a total of 4 administrations. Gamma whole-body planar and/or SPECT/CT imaging of Lu-177-DOTATATE will be obtained at 4 to 72-hours post-injection to confirm localization of treatment to intended targets (optional for participating sites). A CT/MRI for RECIST, Ga-68-DOTATATE and F-18-FDG PETs will be obtained post-2 administrations and post-4 administrations.
* All participants will be contacted by phone within a week after each Lu-177-DOTATATE and in-person every 4 weeks. After the end of treatment visit at week 32, participant will continue to be followed every 12 weeks until 3 years after the first Lu-177-DOTATATE administration. Follow-up visits may be conducted remotely or via telemedicine. After the 3 years, all participants will be contacted yearly until death to assess survival and disease status.
* Participants who have met the primary endpoint of having achieved a PFS of at least 6 months after the initial treatment course, may be eligible to receive further cycles of Lu-177-DOTATATE at the time of progression.",RECRUITING,,2017-10-10,2027-01-01,2026-01-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,130,ESTIMATED

After the scans taken during the iNO treatment are performed some of the baseline assessments will be repeated whilst the patient is on iNO treatment (vital signs including oxygen saturation measurement, ABG, MetHb, 6MWD (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale will be executed and during the 6MWD the oxygen saturation will be measured), PRO, spirometry). During visit 1 the investigator will discontinue iNO to assess if rebound pulmonary hypertension occurs. In the first 2 patients, iNO therapy will be discontinued while 2D echo is performed to assess sPAP. Furthermore, NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured. In the remaining patients the following additional safety assessments (NIBP, HR, SpO2) will be performed while the patient is discontinued at least 20 minutes of iNO. If the investigator considers it is safe to restart the iNO-therapy, the patient will start chronic iNO treatment. After the results of the safety assessments of the 2 first patients are collected a safety meeting will be held to evaluate the results. Depending on the results, the additional 2D echo may be performed in additional patients. Subjects will be contacted via telephone or e-mail ± 24 hours after visit 1, for assessment of vital status, concomitant medications and the occurrence of new AEs or worsening of previously existing recorded AEs and PRO (= visit 2). After 2 weeks of treatment of iNO with a dosage of 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr during at least 12 hours a day patients will be asked to return to the site for visit 3. During that visit following measurements will be performed: patency of nares will be checked, vital signs including oxygen saturation measurement, MetHb, 6MWD (with Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), PRO and AE assessment. After 4 weeks treatment visit 4 will be conducted. 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler (immediately after the 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured) and HRCT scans with contrast agent under iNO pulse will be taken. Before the scans are taken an urine pregnancy test will be obtained, if applicable. A retest of the eGFR CKD-EPI value should also be performed before administering the contrast agent, if there is a clinical indication according to the investigator. Spirometry assessments will be performed, patency of nares, ECG, ABG, MetHb, 6MWD (with Borg CR10 fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), PRO will be assessed. After all assessments are completed, iNO will be discontinued. Twenty minutes after discontinuation of iNO-therapy, spirometry, PRO, MetHb, 6MWD (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale will be executed and during the 6MWD the oxygen saturation will be measured) and 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler measurements measurement will be repeated. Vital signs with oxygen saturation will be measured immediately after the 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler. After all the assessments the patient is placed back on his/her prescribed dose of LTOT using their usual cannula. The patient will be assessed for any signs of acute withdrawal. Therefore vital signs including oxygen saturation will be measured.

At visit 5, two weeks after discontinuation of iNO treatment repeat vital signs with oxygen saturation measurement, physical examination, patency of nares, spirometry, 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler (immediately after the 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured), ABG, MetHb, 6MWD(with Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), and PRO will be performed. If applicable a last urine pregnancy test will be executed to make sure no pregnancy occurred during the study. If there are no follow-up actions for a patient at this visit, it will be considered as a completion of study participation / end of study for that particular patient.",TERMINATED,This was an exploratory open-label study and has met its initial objectives,2016-10,2017-08-21,2017-08-21,INTERVENTIONAL,EARLY_PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,7,ACTUAL

NCT04094194,Meta-analysis of the Nordic Dietary Pattern on Cardiometabolic Risk and Cardiovascular Outcomes,Relation of the Nordic Dietary Pattern With Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Incident Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Prospective Cohort Studies,"The Nordic Diet is a dietary pattern rich in traditional Nordic foods, including berries, grains, and fatty fish common in northern Europe. Studies have shown a protective effect of the Nordic Diet on cardiometabolic risk factors, however only select clinical practice guidelines for the management of diabetes (i.e. Diabetes Canada) recommend this dietary pattern. To support the update of the EASD clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and clinical trials to investigate the association between the Nordic Diet, cardiometabolic outcomes and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. The findings generated by this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing evidence-based guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.","Background: Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a traditional dietary pattern of the wider region of the Mediterranean sea, has been associated with favourable cardiometabolic outcomes, including the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, limited local food availability, increased cost or unfamiliar culture and tradition render the Mediterranean diet difficult to follow in the northern European environment. The Nordic Diet or those of other traditional diets of the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Faeroe islands) are dietary patterns rich in traditional Nordic foods, including berries, grains, and fatty fish common in northern Europe. The Nordic Diet has been associated with favorable cardiometabolic outcomes including improved lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These benefits have been recognized in the most recent updates of the clinical practice guidelines for diabetes in Canada. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) has not included the Nordic dietary pattern in their guidelines.

Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts represent high-quality evidence to support dietary guidelines and public health policy. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted towards food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing the role of the Nordic diet in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic outcomes and cardiovascular diseases.

Objectives: To support the update of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts using the GRADE approach on the Nordic dietary pattern on cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies will be conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.

Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of references of included studies.

Study selection: Randomized controlled trials conducted in humans with a follow-duration ≥ 3 week investigating the effect of a Nordic diet on cardiometabolic outcomes will be included. Studies that are not conducted in humans, not randomized, have an acute feeding design (\<3 weeks), lack a suitable control (non-isocaloric) and/or do not report viable endpoint data will not be included. Prospective cohort studies with greater than 1-year of follow-up will be included.

Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized clinical trials and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for prospective cohorts. All disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data for the randomized clinical. Risk ratios, odds ratios and hazard ratios for clinical outcomes in the prospective cohort studies will be extracted or derived from clinical event data across exposure to a Nordic diet.

Outcomes: For the randomized clinical trials, the primary outcome will be LDL-cholesterol. Secondary outcomes will include markers of glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin); other blood lipids (non-HDL-C, apo B, HDL-C, triglycerides); adiposity (body weight, BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and inflammation (C-reactive protein \[CRP\]).

For prospective cohorts, the primary outcome will be incident CVD Secondary outcomes include incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and incident stroke.

Data synthesis:

Trials: Data will be pooled by the generic inverse-variance method with DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects models were used as they account for residual heterogeneity and yield more conservative estimates. Fixed-effects models will be used for \<5 trials. Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are ≥10 trials, we will explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by study design (parallel or crossover), follow-up duration (\<12 weeks or ≥12 weeks), comparator diet, baseline measurements, risk of bias, disease duration, and funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, diet quality index, composition of the background diet \[total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein\]). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When ≥10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

Prospective cohort studies: Natural log-transformed relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) of clinical outcomes, comparing extreme quantiles (the highest exposure versus the lowest exposure or reference group), will be pooled separately using the generic inverse variance method with random effects models and expressed as RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If ≥10 cohort comparisons were available, then we will perform an a-priori subgroup analyses by meta-regression for follow-up (\<10 years vs. ≥10 years), sex (males vs. females, males vs. mixed, females vs. mixed), study quality (NOS \<6 vs. ≥6) and funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses. Linear and non-linear dose-response relations will be explored with the use of random-effects generalised least-squares trend estimation (GLST) models and spline curve modeling (MKSPLINE procedure), respectively. When ≥10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

Evidence assessment: The certainty of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future guidelines.

Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation to the role of the Nordic Diet in cardiovascular disease prevention and management, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.",UNKNOWN,,2017-12-01,2019-12-01,2019-12-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1,ESTIMATED

Patients with liver cirrhosis and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who will need to undergo systemic therapy will be enrolled. Patients in the first phase will undergo measurement of liver and spleen stiffness and upper endoscopic evaluation and will subsequently be followed for 12 months","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) frequently coexist, affecting cirrhotic individuals' prognosis. Recently it has been confirmed that in cirrhotic patients with favorable Baveno VI consensus (platelets\>150000/mm3 and liver stiffness measurement (LSM\<20 kPa) or combined model based on spleen stiffness, endoscopic screening for varices could be avoided. The Portal Hypertension (PH)-related complications in all patients should be avoided and well managed, especially if they have advanced HCC (aHCC) at diagnosis. However, unlike patients without HCC, endoscopy is recommended for those who undergo systemic therapy, even if compatible with favorable Baveno VI consensus . The reasons for this indication derive from the consideration that the presence of HCC could influence the measurement of LSM and platelet count.

To date, in cirrhotic patients without HCC, according to Baveno VII consensus and the last EASL guidelines for non-invasive tests (NITs), besides LSM, Spleen Stiffness Measurement (SSM) is now considered the most accurate NITs for assessing portal hypertension and predicting the presence of esophageal varices (EVs) and varices needing treatment (VNT).

To date, no studies have evaluated the accuracy of NITs (LSM/SSM) on patients with advanced HCC (aHCC) who should undergo systemic therapy.

The study aims to assess the performance of SSM to rule out VNT in patients with aHCC who undergo systemic therapy.

Each center will prospectively collect data according to an electronic e-CFR on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system, a web application designed to support data capture for research studies in a secure manner.",ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,,2023-06-20,2025-10,2025-06-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,150,ESTIMATED
NCT00005760,"Health Effects of Liposuction in Overweight Women With Elevated Insulin Levels, Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes","A Pilot Study of the Metabolic Effects of Large Volume Liposuction in Overweight Women With Hyperinsulinemia, Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes","This study is for women who have already decided to undergo liposuction at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. To take part in this study, a woman must first meet with the plastic surgeons there, and be accepted by them to have liposuction. This study will investigate whether large volume liposuction improves risk factors for heart disease in overweight women with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or elevated blood insulin levels. Large volume liposuction is the surgical removal of at least 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of body fat, usually from the abdomen, hips or chest. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure and elevated levels of blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), blood glucose (sugar), and blood insulin. Subjects who participate in all parts of this study will receive a total of $930.00.

Overweight women 18 years or older with high blood insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes, who are planning to have large volume liposuction performed at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., may be eligible for this study. For a subject to be accepted into this study, she must first meet with the plastic surgeons at Georgetown University Medical Center, and they have to agree to perform large volume liposuction. The decision that someone is suitable for liposuction is not under the control of the NIH or of any NIH investigator.

Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures at four separate times - before undergoing liposuction, 4 weeks after surgery, 4 months after surgery and 1 year after surgery:

* Body measurements - taken with calipers to measure several skinfold thicknesses (the width of a fat fold) and with a tape measure to measure the circumference of parts of the body.
* Urine sample and 6-hour urine collection - to test for pregnancy and to evaluate kidney function.
* Glucose tolerance test - measures insulin sensitivity and how the body uses sugar, how well insulin works, and insulin sensitivity. The procedure involves placement of two catheters (thin, flexible tubes) through a needle into a vein in each arm. Sugar water is infused into one catheter and 20 minutes into the test a small amount of insulin is injected. Blood samples are drawn from the other catheter at frequent intervals for a total of 5 hours.
* Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography - measure the heart's electrical activity and function.
* Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan - produces images for measuring body fat in the abdomen. (not done at the 4-week visit). Takes about half an hour to complete.
* DXA X-ray - measures body fat, muscle and bone mineral content. Takes about half an hour to complete.
* Bod Pod - capsule-like device used to determine the proportion of body weight composed of fat and non-fat tissue. Takes less than 10 minutes
* Bioelectric impedance analysis device - measures the proportions of body fat based on electrical conduction of a small electric current. Takes 2-3 minutes.
* 24-hour blood pressure monitoring - a device attached to a blood pressure cuff strapped to the arm measures blood pressure every 15 to 30 minutes continuously for 24 hours.
* Vascular reactivity tests - a blood pressure cuff is inflated for about 4 minutes before deflating, providing information on the function of the small blood vessels in the skin, as well as an idea of the function level of small blood vessels elsewhere in the body. Takes half an hour.
* Blood samples - collected to evaluate kidney and liver function and to measure body lipids, such as cholesterol, minerals, and other substances.","Obesity is a major predisposing factor for future Type 2 diabetes because it is often associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has been suggested as the common link for other aspects of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome that includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and macrovascular arterial disease. There are racial disparities in the prevalence of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes: Compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians, African American women have almost twice the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.

Because data from predominantly Caucasian populations suggest that the quantity of truncal (sometimes called upper body) adipose tissue, which includes the adipose tissue surrounding the abdominal viscera, is far more important for risk stratification than that found in the limbs or buttocks, which contain subcutaneous adipose tissue, it has been presumed that attempts at treatment of obesity should concentrate on reducing visceral fat. However, despite their greater risks for the complications of obesity, African Americans have less visceral abdominal adipose tissue than Caucasians matched for body weight. Further, recent metabolic studies suggest that upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play a significant role, particularly for African Americans, in the comorbid metabolic conditions associated with obesity.

With the advent of the large volume liposuction technique, selective removal of substantial quantities of subcutaneous adipose tissue has become possible. It is unknown whether the complications of obesity can be ameliorated by removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but one preliminary study suggests that fasting hyperinsulinism can be improved by this approach.

We propose to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients (five Caucasians and five African-Americans) who plan to undergo liposuction. We will investigate how large volume liposuction affects the metabolic complications of obesity in overweight patients who have hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. We will investigate the effects of liposuction on various indices of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome by performing studies of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism at four time points: before large volume liposuction, 1 month after liposuction, 4 months after liposuction, and 1 year after liposuction. At each visit we will study body composition, blood pressure, cardiac function, dietary habits, insulin insensitivity, free fatty acids, and lipid profiles.",COMPLETED,,2000-05,2002-01,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,10,

NCT06543394,Engaging Patients in Adherence Interventions Using Behavioral Science,Optimizing Recruitment Methodology for Medication Adherence Interventions: The ENGaging Patients in Adherence Interventions UsinG Behavioral SciencE (ENGAGE) Randomized Factorial Trial,"The overarching goal of the proposed research is to prepare an evidence-based clinical pharmacist-delivered medication adherence intervention for sustainable implementation and dissemination. Because the effectiveness of the intervention has already been demonstrated in a NIH Stage Model Stage 4 trial called STIC2IT, this study will include an NIH Stage Model Stage 5 Effectiveness-Implementation Type 3 Hybrid design, in which the primary focus is on testing different implementation methods, while secondarily observing clinical effects. The overarching hypothesis is that investigators can identify the most impactful elements of a behavioral theory-informed recruitment approach, which can be replicable across clinical settings.

Accordingly, this study will perform testing of behaviorally-informed recruitment approaches in a primary care setting that serves patients from under-resourced communities. Patients will be English or Spanish speaking adults ≥18 years of age identified through the electronic health record (EHR) as having a primary care clinician at the participating practice as well as uncontrolled hypertension and suboptimal adherence to blood pressure medications based on pharmacy fill data linked to the electronic health record (EHR). The primary care clinicians of eligible patients identified through the EHR will have the opportunity to opt-out any patients they wish not to be included. Patients will then be randomized to each of the following conditions, such that there will be 8 total arms: (1) inclusion of a mailer primer (yes/no), (2) the most successful recruitment letter from a preliminary study using prospect theory (versus the control letter), and (3) intensity of the intervention outreach (up to 4 calls vs. up to 2 calls).

Patients across all arms who agree to be scheduled will receive an appointment with one of the clinical pharmacists trained in the brief negotiated interviewing approach used in the STIC2IT trial. The primary outcome will be completion of a clinical pharmacist appointment within 12 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes will include scheduled visit rates, no-show rates for scheduled appointments, pharmacy fill adherence to statins and blood pressure medications over the 3-month follow-up, and clinical outcomes, including blood pressure as per EHR data in the 3 months after randomization.","Participants will be recruited from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)-affiliated primary care clinics that are part of the New York Presbyterian (NYP) Ambulatory Care Network (ACN). These clinics provide care to patients in the catchment area of CUIMC which is notable for substantial racial, ethnic, and economic diversity. The study team will identify participants with uncontrolled hypertension (last office BP \<140/90 mmHg) who also are nonadherent (PDC\<80%) to at least one antihypertensive medication class and meet other study eligibility criteria.

Participants will then be randomized using a 2\^3 factorial approach to each of the following conditions, such that there will be 8 total arms: (1) inclusion of a mailer primer (yes vs no), (2) a behavioral theory-informed letter script (vs usual scripted letter), and (3) intensity of the recruitment outreach (up to 4 calls vs up to 2 calls). Recruitment outreach will be conducted by members of the study team, who will be trained to deliver different interventions based on a patient's assigned arm. Enrollment will be staggered over an approximately 4-month period so as not to overwhelm the scheduling staff and mimic how quality improvement programs are conducted in typical practice.

Participants who agree to participate in the adherence counseling session after receiving any of the 8 combinations of recruitment strategies will be scheduled to receive a brief evidence-based medication adherence counseling session known as brief negotiated interviewing. Patients who schedule a counseling session with a clinical pharmacist will receive a reminder call before their appointment. This will involve a 30-minute or less telephone or video visit with a nurse or clinical pharmacist who will use a semi-structured guide to confirm the patient's treatment regimen, engage them in sharing potential barriers to adherence or other factors that may be contributing to poor disease control, discuss their readiness to modify behaviors, and work with the patient to develop a shared plan.

The study will concurrently test whether 1) inclusion of a mailed primer is better than no inclusion, 2) whether use of a behavioral theory-informed message-framing strategy in the recruitment letter is better than the usual approach that does not include theory-informed message framing in a recruitment letter, and 3) whether increasing the intensity of recruitment outreach after the letter through up to 4 phone calls is better than up to 2 phone calls. The primary outcome for the study will be whether or not patients completed the adherence counseling session within 12 weeks of randomization.

The only known way to reduce the rate of disease progression is by reducing the pressure in the eye (the intraocular pressure, IOP). Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is an ophthalmic laser intervention with the purpose of reducing the IOP.

SLT can be performed in different ways, with four of the treatment protocols being evaluated in the Optimal SLT (OSLT) trial.

SLT is a repeatable procedure, but scientific evidence is scarce regarding more than one repetition. In this trial, patients included in the OSLT trial will be invited to the extended trial (OSLT-R), for further follow-up and re-treatment with SLT, if needed.","Subjects already included in the OSLT trial (NCT03798223) will be invited to the extended trial (OSLT-R) at the time of SLT re-treatment or when OSLT follow up is scheduled to terminate. Patients are re-treated as needed, according to the randomized group assignment performed in the OSLT inclusion process.

The OSLT-R trial is aiming to elucidate:

* If the SLT efficacy, in terms of relative IOP reduction (percent of baseline IOP), changes with additional SLT iterations.
* If the longevity of IOP reduction after SLT changes with additional SLT iterations.
* If repeated SLT is associated with a change in postoperative discomfort or adverse events.

All of the above will be analyzed within each of the four treatment groups (SLT protocols) in the trial. Further, analysis will also be conducted regarding differences between the treatment groups regarding the above.

NCT01451060,Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes of the Use of Vasopressors to Treat Hypotension During Spinal Anesthesia for Cesarean,Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes After the Use of Vasopressors to Correct Hypotension During Cesarean Section Under Spinal Anesthesia in Pregnant Women With Severe Preeclampsia: Randomized Clinical Trial,"Anesthesia for cesarean section has been a great challenge for the anesthesiologist, for mother and fetus are closely related. So the challenge is to anesthetize the mother without interfering with the physiology of the fetus. The spinal block, although safe, are not free of complications if not treated properly, may be responsible for increased fetal morbidity. Among the major side effects, there is hypotension, with potentially serious consequences for the maternal-fetal dyad. Hypotension in pregnant women at low risk may not lead to major damage, but a pregnant woman with low reserves, as is the case of pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, any drop in blood pressure of the mother can bring harm to the welfare of mother and fetus. Based on the above, the purpose of this study is to compare the effects of maternal and perinatal treatment of hypotension with ephedrine or metaraminol in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. There will be a randomized, double-blind, which will be included pregnant women with severe preeclampsia with indication of cesarean section, gestational age above 34 weeks gestation and only.Will be Excluded women with hemorrhagic syndromes of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, eclampsia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, fetal distress and absolute contraindications to spinal anesthesia.

All patients are fully informed of the research objectives and will only be included in the study if they agree to participate and sign the Instrument of Consent. The project was designed following the recommendations of Resolution 196/96 of the National Health and the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects (2000). In addition, the project was submitted to the Ethics Committee in Research of the Institute of Integrative Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira, is approved. The study will be conducted from June 2011 to July 2012. The study variables are: consumption of metaraminol and ephedrine before and after birth, the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, incidence of maternal hypotension, the occurrence of reactive hypertension, occurrence of bradycardia, pH of umbilical cord, Apgar score 5 minutes, need for face mask ventilation and ICU admission.","Ephedrine, a long time was considered the safest drug for both mother and fetus during the treatment of hypotension in Caesarean section. However, recent evidence shows that contrary to what was thought, ephedrine appears to increase fetal metabolism, decreasing the pH and excess base.

Recently, phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of hypotension during cesarean delivery with better results in relation to acid-base parameters in umbilical cord blood. However, few data are available on the use of phenylephrine in high-risk pregnancy, the majority of studies in healthy pregnant women for elective caesarean section.

Although little scientific evidence regarding the use of metaraminol for treatment of hypotension in Caesarean section, recent study demonstrated superiority of this drug compared to ephedrine, checking a lower incidence of neonatal acidosis and better control of blood pressure. The researchers also found differences in blood gases from the umbilical cord between the ephedrine and metaraminol groups larger than those already found in previous studies comparing ephedrine and phenylephrine.

The pathophysiological changes in patients with pre-eclampsia can lead to intrauterine growth restriction with chronic fetal distress, due to the limited uteroplacental flow, which, in certain situations, may be reduced by 50% to 70%. Added to this, spinal anesthesia may cause sudden hypotension and fetal acidosis more often, even in elective operations, compared to epidural or general anesthesia, and that these changes may not have clinical significance in healthy fetuses at term, but may be critical in situations where arterial insufficiency uteroplacental and fetal distress already to present. It is believed, therefore, important that treat or prevent hypotension in patients with severe preeclampsia under spinal anesthesia.

Prevention of hypotension in patients with severe preeclampsia does not require large amounts of intravenous fluids, but careful prophylaxis of postural hypotensive syndrome. Despite the care, if hypotension occurs, aggressive treatment is mandatory in these patients and fast in order to avoid worsening fetal distress and neonatal depression. Such patients are more sensitive to vasopressors, therefore, small doses should be administered.

However, the biggest challenge of the anesthesiologist is to determine the ideal vasopressor in pregnant women at high risk, able to adequately restore blood pressure levels without determining deterioration of fetal status.

30 Reynolds and Seed in 2005 showed that ephedrine, administered in large doses, has contributed to the adverse effects of spinal anesthesia (greater degree of fetal metabolic acidosis), supporting the idea that ephedrine is not the vasopressor of choice for treatment of maternal hypotension during cesarean section.

As a result, this study is to fill this knowledge gap, taking on great importance to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia to receive ephedrine or metaraminol for treatment of maternal hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Considering the importance of creating a protocol, since the metaraminol, unlike phenylephrine, is widely available at our facility.",WITHDRAWN,We didn't have enough financial support,2011-06,2014-07,2014-06,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,0,ACTUAL

NCT04607876,Family at Risk Study,Family at Risk Study,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors include hypertension as a key risk factor, as well as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, diet, inactivity, family history and age. These are highly prevalent in the US population with risk factor control far from optimal.1-3 Hypertension affects approximately 30% of adults and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) supports population screening.4 Many individuals have multiple risk factors, with declining rates of control with an increasing numbers of risk factors,5 but greater benefit through the control of multiple risk factors.6 Prior approaches to primary and primordial ASCVD risk mitigation generally fail to target motivated populations for identification and modification of risk factors. Data from the ongoing project C3FIT has shown first-degree relatives of a stroke patient are such a highly motivated population, having seen the end result of failed ASCVD risk control in their relative. Also, family history of stroke or heart disease is an independent risk factor for ASCVD including stroke and heart attack7-11 and there is a family risk-factor clustering putting this group at higher risk.12-14 However, current clinical practice does not seize the opportunity to assess and intervene on the family members of individuals with stroke or CAD despite their being enriched with individuals at elevated risk and high motivation to reduce that risk.

The Family at Risk (FAR) Trial targets this high-risk/high-motivation population of the biological offspring and siblings of an index stroke patient. FAR will evaluate two strategies for risk factor control: 1) FAR-Education/Coaching Arm (FAR-EC Arm): providing education from the American Heart/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) and coaching on risk factor control, versus 2) FAR-Enhanced Intervention Arm (FAR-EI Arm): the education and coaching strategy described above plus a combined virtual and in-person m-health management strategy to modify ASCVD risk factors using HealthStream/Harmonize technology. This supplemental management includes a home-based and family-focused participant-centric strategy for identification of ASCVD risk factors, education tailored to participant needs, and implementation of a technology-enabled m-health management strategy. This management strategy, known as ""Harmonize"" was shown to efficiently manage risk factors in Project Trident (Remote Patient Monitoring Pilot for High Risk Patients, IRB#: 2018-0063-HCP; Nov 2018 - Nov 2020) that aimed to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors in an eldery (mean age = 79 years), racially mixed, primary prevention population (Pulicharam, publication in process).

Adoption of research into a clinical environment depends not only on the efficacy of the therapy, but the quality of the evidence supporting its utilization, and the acceptance of the therapy to patients and caregivers. Major national groups have low level evidence supporting real world approaches to management of these risk factors (USPSTF recommendations ""Insufficient"" or ""B"" or ""C""). While specifically not developing a guideline, FAR seeks to fill that gap with high quality research data that will inform guidelines and health system approaches to primary prevention, and assess the acceptability of approaches to the affected participant population; leading to dissemination of study results to a real-world setting. By incorporating input from patients, physicians (internal medicine, primary care, and neurology), nurses, and the AHA in the design, implementation, and dissemination of study results, study investigators anticipate good acceptance of study results. FAR will inform key stakeholders (stroke patients, their first-degree relatives, and the healthcare system) regarding the prevalence and impact of family history as an ASCVD risk factor, and how best to mitigate that risk. This effort will be conducted in two phases. During the feasibility phase, the relatives of stroke patients will be assessed regarding their current level of recognition of risk, their willingness to engage in risk measurement, the feasibility of remote monitoring, educational and behavioral factors that would lead to behavior change. Simultaneously, primary care physicians (PCPs) will be assessed regarding perceptions of care gaps, feasibility of use of the chronic disease management technology,20 and design features that might present issues; with development and testing of educational and motivational materials and content.

Inflammation is one mechanism by which diabetes and elevated cholesterol damage blood vessels. Inflammation can be increased by oxidative stress. This study will see if Alpha Lipoic acid, a potent antioxidant and over the counter product, reduces blood levels of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation when compared with placebo. Placebo is a substance that looks like the real product, but contains no active product.","This is a randomized study. A randomized study means you will be assigned by chance (like the toss of a coin) to one of four groups and receive either alpha lipoic acid (ALA or placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the real drug). In this study, there is a 1 out of 4 chance you will receive placebo. Three of the groups will receive different doses of ALA and one group will receive placebo only. The groups are: placebo only, 600 mg ALA, 1200 mg ALA, and 1800 mg ALA a day. At some point all study participants will receive placebo; sometimes the pills will be ALA and sometimes they will be placebo. You will not know which you are taking on any given day.

This study is also double-blinded, which means that you, the study doctor, and the Sponsor will not know until the end of the study whether you are receiving ALA or placebo only. Your study doctor can find out if you are receiving ALA or placebo if needed in an emergency.

If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to come in for up to 6 visits in 12 weeks. You should be fasting before some of these visits. Fasting means that you should have nothing to eat or drink, except water with your usual morning medications, for 10 hours before your scheduled study visit. The study staff will go over this with you each time.

Visit 1-Screening: (about 3 hours)

• Please fast before this visit

In order to find out if you qualify to take part in the study, you will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:

* Your health history will be taken
* Your height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured
* You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* You will give fasting blood samples of about 3-5 tablespoons and urine samples
* If you are female and can have children, you will be given a urine pregnancy test
* You will take a glucose tolerance test (GTT) A dietitian will briefly discuss your diet and exercise. An ECG will be done to measure your heart function. ECG measures the electrical activity of your heart. You will be asked to lie down and small sticky pads will be placed on your arms, legs, and across your chest.

The GTT test involves collecting 1 blood sample before, and 4 samples up to 2 hours after, you drink a measured amount of glucose (a sugar) in a pleasant tasting liquid. You will have 2 tablespoons of blood drawn. An indwelling intravenous (IV) needle will be inserted into your vein for the 2-hour period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.

Depending on the results of your blood and urine tests, you may be asked to come in for a second visit in about 1 week. The screening blood tests may provide you with information on your health that could be important to you, for example diagnosing diabetes.

VISIT 2: (about 1 hour)

• You do not have to fast for this visit and may take your morning medications as usual

You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:

- You will meet with a dietician for an assessment of your eating habits. The dietitian will advise you on how to maintain a stable diet during the study.

* If your blood tests indicate that you have diabetes, you will receive instructions on diet and exercise to improve your blood sugar levels.
* If your HbA1c level is high, you will be given a home glucose monitoring device (glucometer) with instructions on its use for daily testing. HbA1c is a measure of average glucose levels over the prior few weeks.
* You will be given a 2-week supply of study drug and asked to stop any over- the-counter vitamins that you are taking until you have completed this study. We will provide 3 bottles of study medicine at a time. Each bottle will be uniquely identified for use in the morning, midday or evening. You will be asked to take 2 tablets from the morning bottle, then 2 from the midday bottle and 2 from the evening bottle. You will also be given a daily multivitamin to take. This will be a total of 7 tablets a day for 10 weeks.

All unused study drug should be returned when you come in for the next visit in 2 weeks. It is important that you are able to take all the study drug. If we find that you are unable to take most of the study drug, you will be removed from the study.

VISIT 3: (about 6-8 hours)

•

* Please be fasting and do not have alcohol or exercise for 48 hours prior to the visit. You may be asked to withhold some of your usual medicines on this day but bring the doses to the visit with you to be taken at a later time. You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:
* Brachial artery ultrasound: This is a way to see how the walls of your arteries respond to change in blood flow. For this test, you will lie on a bed and we will take sound wave pictures of the artery in your elbow area. After the initial pictures, we will then inflate a blood pressure cuff on your upper arm for 5 minutes. As soon as the cuff is deflated more pictures of the same artery are taken. We will give then give you a pill called nitroglycerine to dissolve under your tongue. When the pill dissolves in a few minutes, final pictures of the same artery will be taken.
* The brachial test will be repeated 2 hours after a high fat meal is eaten. We will give the meal to you It will contain known amounts of fat,carbohydrates, and protein.
* Augmentation index: This is a test to see how stiff the walls of your artery may be. A small microphone will record the signal from the artery in your wrist for about 5 minutes.
* Several samples of blood (2 tablespoons) will be taken before you eat the high fat meal and when the second brachial test is completed. An indwelling IV needle may be inserted into your vein during this period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.
* DEXA scan. DEXA is a 4-5 minute x-ray body scan that provides accurate body fat mass measurements.If you are a woman who can have children, you will have a urine pregnancy test. If you are pregnant you will NOT be able to have the DEXA scan.
* A dietician will assist you with food questionnaire about your usual diet.
* A 4-week supply of study drug will be given to you with instructions on how to take it. Please bring any remaining study drug bottles with you to your next visit.

Visit 4: telephone call. You will also be asked about your ability and willingness to continue to take the study medicine until the end of the study.

Thirty minutes after ingesting 2g of green tea or placebo, they performed treadmill walking (60 minutes), 60 to 85% of maximum heart rate intensity in procedures with exercises. BP was measured at rest and at every 10 minutes after exercise (60 minutes). Blood samples were taken before the ingestion of green tea or placebo and immediately after exercise to determine Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Nitrite (NO) dosages. Reduction of systolic BP compared with the rest, during PL+Ex recovery procedure.","Subjects of study: Double- blind study, randomized and placebo, conduced with fifteen both sexes hypertensive individuals, physically active and practitioners of exercises for at least 3 months prior to trials. All patients were users of anti- hypertensive medication except beta- blockers and maintained medication throughout study period. They were demanded not to be diabetic and women not menopaused. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research with Human Beings of the Health Sciences Centre at the Federal University of Paraiba- CEP/ CCS, under the protocol 0120/13. Individuals were required to sign The Free and Clarified Consent Term (FCCT), according to resolution 196/96 of National Health Council.

Study Designs: subjects performed three experimental procedures, two practicing aerobic exercises and one without physical exercises. The sessions with exercises were conducted under previous administration of a green tea dosage or placebo (GT+Ex or PL+Ex), ingested 30 minutes before the start of exercises protocol. In the session without exercises (GT) they ingested green tea and remained sit during the same period destined to the exercises. Heart Rate Measurement were registered at rest (RHR) and in every ten minutes during physical exercise protocol. BP measurements were taken before (at rest), immediately after exercise and in every ten minutes during a recovery period of 60 minutes after the end of exercise protocol, or in the period they remained sit. Blood samples were collected prior and immediately after exercise or period without exercise for analysis of plasmatic concentration of anti and pro- oxidant agents (nitrite- NO and Malondialdehyde- MDA).

Instruments and Procedures:Physical Exercises: After the purposes of the research were clarified to the individuals, they were invited to proceed to the laboratory in order for exercise sessions performance. The groups were submitted to three sessions, two of those on treadmill aerobic exercise during 60 minutes. Furthermore, it was established that the individuals should practice exercises scoring between 11 and 14 in Borg and Noble's Subjective Perceived Exertion Scale. They were requested to hold the intensity of physical exercises from 60% to 85% of HRmax (maximum Heart Rate), monitored during sessions with a Polar frequency meter model RS800CX (Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland).

Supplementation of Green Tea or Placebo: Green tea and placebo capsules were produced in a compounding laboratory. The investigators used 2g of green tea dried leaves and discovered an improvement in oxidative stress. The group with green tea consumption ingested capsules with 2g of concentrated powder, approximately 1960mg in polyphenols (636mg of epigallocatechin gallate) and 20mg of caffeine; placebo group consumed capsules containing 2g of cornstarch powder, all swallowed with water. Capsules were administered to patients after a skilled professional collected blood samples. Researchers conducted supplementation of substances after pre- exercise blood collection and sessions initiated only 30 minutes after the ingestion of capsules, which is the time required by the body to absorb nutrients.

Blood Pressure Measurement: Individuals had their BPs checked previously, immediately after the end of the exercise and during 60 minutes post- exercise. BP at rest was verified after the subjects remained sit for 10 minutes. By the end of the walking session, BP was checked with sitting subjects. During recovery, BP was verified in every 10 minutes during all 60 minutes of walking session. The protocol adopted was the one proposed by the Brazilian Society of Cardiology and the Brazilian Society of Hypertension.

Blood Collection Protocol: Performed prior and immediately after exercise. Ten milliliters (ml) of blood were collected from the antecubital vein, of which five ml were placed in test tubes containing EDTA and carefully homogenized by inversion. The other five ml were placed in tubes without any anticoagulant. Then they were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 minutes. Plasma was isolated, placed in ependorf tubes and refrigerated in 20 ºC until analysis.

Evaluation of oxidative stress (MDA): Oxidizing activity was quantified through thiobarbituric acid reaction with the products from hydroperoxides decomposition. Therefore, 250 µl of sample was added to KCl and incubated in water bath maintained at 37° C for 60 minutes. Then mixture was precipitated with 35% AA perchloric and centrifuged at 14000 rpm and 4°C for 10 minutes. Supernatant was transferred to new ependorfs, adding 400 µl of 0.6% thiobarbituric acid and incubated at 95-100° C for 30 min. After cooling, material was read by spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 532nm.

Nitrite Dosage The method was based on the Griess reagent usage. Reagent was prepared utilizing equal parts of 5% phosphoric acid, 0.1% N-1-naphthalenediamine (NEED), 1% sulphanilamide, 5% in phosphoric acid and distilled water. To accomplish the test, 100 µl of 10% homogenate supernatant made with potassium phosphate buffer was added to 100µl Griess reagent. Regarding the white one, 100 µl reagent was added to 100 µl of buffer and series of dilutions were conducted to obtain standard curve (100, 50, 25 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56 µm) of nitrite. The entire test was executed in a 96 well- plate template with reader at an absorbance range of 560 nm.

NCT03890627,Thoracic Bio-reactance Measurement of Cardiac Output in Pulmonary Hypertension,Interest of Cardiac Output Measurement by Thoracic Bio-reactance for Monitoring of Patients Treated for a Pulmonary Hypertension,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a rare disease characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to a progressive decline in cardiac output (CO).Since cardiac output is correlated with the prognosis of the disease, the conduct of a right heart catheterization (thermodilution measurement, reference technique) during the annual follow-up visit of patients in competences centres is recommended. In practice, it is not systematically performed because of it is invasive, with potential risk for the patient, and there is limited logistical capacity for its implementation. The estimation of cardiac output is thus often based on cardiac ultrasound but its measurement is potentially biased.

Starling ™ SV is a non-invasive cardiac output monitor based on thoracic bio-reactance measurement. Several clinical studies have shown that cardiac output measured by bio-reactance is strongly correlated with the measurement obtained by catheterization in different indications. Rich et al. (2013) assessed bio-reactance specifically in 50 patients with Pulmonary Hypertension compared with thermodilution. The results showed that the measurement of cardiac output by bio-reactance was feasible in these patients, had a better accuracy than by catheterization, and was reliable for detecting changes in cardiac output after a vasodilatation test.

The Starling ™ SV monitor could thus have a place in the follow-up of patients who are being treated for Pulmonary Hypertension. Since it is a rapid, non-invasive examination, it could be performed on an outpatient basis, especially as a first-line test to check the stability of the CO, thus avoiding the systematic use of right heart catheterization, which would then be reserved only to patients for whom the measurement by bio-reactance would show a decrease of cardiac output compared to the previous value. Before being able to propose this use in current practice, it is necessary to carry out a pilot study which will make it possible to explore the interest of bio-reactance in this situation.",,COMPLETED,,2019-05-21,2022-05-31,2022-05-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,60,ACTUAL
NCT04554160,Arrhythmias in Pulmonary Hypertension Assessed by Continuous Long-term Cardiac Monitoring,ArrhythmiaS in Pulmonary arterIal hypeRtEnsion and Right Heart Failure Assessed by Continuous Long-term Cardiac Monitoring,"Arrhythmias are considered a prominent phenomenon in pulmonary hypertension (PH) as the disease progresses. According primarily to retrospective studies with up to 24 hours of monitoring, supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) can be found in 8-35% of patients, with significant impact on survival.

Furthermore, a few prospective studies to date deploying short-term monitoring (10 minutes-24 hours) have revealed lower heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

In ASPIRE arrhythmias and heart rate variability is being assessed via long term monitoring.

Currently the the loop-recorder is considered the gold standard for long-term continuous cardiac montoring. A non-invasive continuous monitoring could be of a great benefit for the patients, and could potentially contribute to treatment optimization.

The study will assess apple watches as a non-invasive tool compared to to the loop recorder, which is considered as the current gold standard.

Additionally, the study seeks to assess apple watches for monitoring as an independent wearable for risk assessment in PH.","In general there is a lack of evidence of the arrhythmic burden in PH. The present study is the first to apply continuous long-term cardiac monitoring in patients with PH to describe the prevalence of arrhythmias in PH by continuous long-term cardiac monitoring. Furthermore, the correlation between heart rate variability and risk assessment parameters including WHO functional class (FC), NT-proBNP, 6MWT, cardiac parameters and cardiac function will be studies.

A few prospective studies have demonstrated lower HRV in PH than in healthy individuals, however only based on short-term monitoring (20 minutes to 24 hour) and only in a few patients. In retrospective studies, a higher mortality in children with PAH and low HRV has been shown with 24 hour Holter monitoring. Consequently, there is a lack of evidence regarding right heart failure and the prognostic value of HRV.

Risk assessment in PH is essential in the selection of treatment in PH and for prognosis in the study ASPIRE the investigators will assess the use of heart rate variability in pulmonary hypertension.

In conclusion the ASPIRE study will:

1. Assess the incidence and prevalence of arrhythmias using long term cardiac monitoring via a reveal LINQ loop recorder (Medtronic). Furthermore, the investigators will assess; Change in cardiac index, right atrial size, RV size, fibrosis and stroke volume.
2. The investigators will assess the arrhythmic burden in relation to:

   * Change in 6 MWT
   * Hemodynamic changes with RHC
   * Hemodynamic changes in echocardiography
   * The number of patients progressing one FC (Modified NYHA class)
   * Changes in NT-proBNP.
   * Hospital admission for any reason
   * Death or transplantation
3. Monitor heart rate variability and address a comparison to known risk markers and CMR and echocardiography.

   The study specifically seeks to investigate following:
   * The incidence and type of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in PH by continuous long-term monitoring

In 2017, the prevalence of HHD worldwide was 217.9 per 100,000 people, an increase of 7.4% over 1990, which has brought huge financial burden and social and economic losses to the world. Therefore, HHD is a major public health challenge worldwide. In our previous studies, we found that miR-455-5p, a microRNA, could functioned as an inducer to promote cardiac hypertrophy. Because cardiac hypertrophy was a common phenomenon in patients with HHD, so it is interesting to clarify whether miR-455-5p could be employed as a marker to indicate the function and/or structure of heart in the development of HHD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to collect blood samples of hypertensive patients, as well as analysis the correlation between serum miR-455-5p level and cardiac function. The research could help doctors better predict the course of hypertensive heart disease and provide more effective treatments for different patients.","The purpose of this study was to collect blood samples of hypertensive patients, in order to clarify the correlation between serum miR-455-5p level and cardiac function.

EAT thickness is also associated with MetS and hypertension, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and insulin resistance.Studies have shown that moderate-intensity and high-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance exercise training reduce EAT. However, aerobic and resistance exercises may be found challenging and demanding by individuals and in most cases, high or moderate intensity exercise may be considered difficult. In a study conducted in physically inactive individuals, it was concluded that there was a significant increase in heart rate and BP following spinal stabilisation exercises performed 4 days a week for a total of 8 sessions for 2 weeks, but the increase in these cardiac parameters would tend to decrease following regular exercise. In the current literature, there is no study evaluating the effect of spinal stabilisation exercise on EAT thickness, exercise capacity and cardiovascular parameters in individuals with HT.

Barriers to access to healthcare services such as distance, time and cost can be overcome with technology. COVID-19 has accelerated the transition of many physiotherapy services to telerehabilitation.

Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder of the second half of pregnancy , which is characterized by increased vascular reactivity and peripheral resistance with pathological changes that are consistent with impaired blood flow to the affected vascular beds. Investigators will evaluate fetal and maternal vascular changes in normotensive and pre-eclamptic patients by Ultrasound and Doppler and their impact on prediction of pregnancy outcome.","Pre-eclampsia affects 2-8% of all pregnancies, although treatment is generally effective. However, 10-15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia(WHO, 2011). There is a considerable evidence that generalized endothelial dysfunction underlies the clinical manifestations of the disease (Oladipupo et al., 2014).

It has been demonstrated that peripheral nutritive blood flow is impaired in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and precedes onset of the disorder (Kenny et al., 2014).

The pathophysiological mechanism is characterized by a failure of the trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries which may be associated with an increased vascular resistance of the uterine artery and a decreased perfusion of placenta. (Al-Jameil et al ; 2014 ) Ultrasound of the brachial artery, and Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery and uterine artery are propaedeutic , non-invasive methods that contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of PE and Eclampsia (Takata et al., 2002 ).

Doppler assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for impaired placentation and its complications of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and perinatal death. Assessment of the fetal circulation is essential in the better understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide range of pathological pregnancies and their clinical management(Ghidini \& Vergani, 2012).",UNKNOWN,,2017-05-31,2021-12,2021-12,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,100,ESTIMATED

Potato, a potassium-rich food with high glycemic responses after consumption, exhibits unclear effects on hypertension. In this study, the investigators aimed to examine the association between potato consumption and hypertension risk among Chinese people.","Potato is considered as a superior crop due to its significant nutritive value and great production yield. China is the largest potato producer with a quarter of world production, followed by India, Russia, and USA. The potato production as well as consumption has enhanced in developing countries while continuously declined in developed countries during the last decade. The investigators therefore explored the prospective associations of consumption of total potatoes, sweet potatoes, stir-fried potatoes, and non stir-fried potatoes with the risk of hypertension in general people of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) cohort study from 1989 to 2011. A total of 11,763 participants (≥20 years old) who were free of hypertension at baseline were enrolled from CHNS Cohort study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the associations after adjusting for potential confounders. This study provides new evidence on the association of various potato consumption with the incidence of hypertension in China. As urbanization accelerates across the whole domain of China, the tendency of transition to Western-style diets and lifestyles appears continuously and steeply growing. More and more potatoes will be consumed as processed potato products including potatoes chips and French fries, which may be a potential risk factor of hypertension occurrence.",COMPLETED,,1989-01-01,2018-02-01,2011-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,11763,ACTUAL

NCT01899027,Rosuvastatin for Preventing Complications in Renal Ablation,Adjunctive Rosuvastatin Treatment for prEventing coMplIcationS In Renal Ablation,The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that twice overnight high-dose rosuvastatin loading before RNA followed by 3-month treatment with regular doses of rosuvastatin can reduce both the acute and late renal artery damage.,"Despite the availability and use of different classes of antihypertensive drugs, 5-30% of patients still show elevated blood pressure (EUROASPIRE III survey, 2011).

Recently, a novel catheter-based radiofrequency ablation technique has been developed allowing for renal nerve ablation (RNA). Currently, two different catheter-based systems are primarily used (Simplicityw catheter by Medtronic-Adrian and the EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter from St Jude Medical).

The RNA technique has been associated with a very low complication rate, but the development of a renal artery stenosis after RNA has been reported (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:2694-2695).

Although little is known about the vascular injury induced by the RNA procedure at the site of ablation, a recent study has reported for the first time the evidence at optical coherence tomography (OCT) of local vascular injury induced by the radiofrequency energy. Such local tissue damage, which is not apparent with angiography, is characterized by local and diffuse vasospasm, oedema formation, and endothelial injury with thrombus generation (Templin et al. Eur Heart J, 25 April 2012).

Experimental research have suggested that these abnormalities are only present in the acute phase immediately after RNA and seem to be the consequence of a transient phenomenon of inflammation (Clin Res Cardiol 2011;100:1095-1101), similarly to what occurs in the coronary arteries after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

In the last decade, multiple studies have convincingly shown that the pre-procedural administration of statins can significantly reduce the extent of cardiac damage at time of PCI (Patti et al, JACC 2011). No previous investigation, however, has assessed whether pre-procedural statin load play any protective role on renal arteries at time of RNA.

Study Population Patients with resistant arterial hypertension scheduled to undergo renal artery ablation

Randomization Patients will be randomized to receive two overnight high doses of Rosuvastatin (40 mg 12 h before RNA and another 10 mg dose 2 h before the procedure, N=50) or placebo (N=50).

Study design Patients will be randomized to receive two overnight high doses of Rosuvastatin (40 mg 12 h before RNA and another 10 mg 2 hours prior to the procedure, N=56) or placebo (N=56).

RNA will be performed with two different catheter-based systems (Simplicityw catheter by Medtronic-Adrian and the EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter from St Jude Medical).

All patients will have OCT utilizing the C7-XR imaging system (Light-Lab Imaging, Inc., Westford, USA) before and after renal denervation of both renal arteries.

After the procedure, patients included in the Rosuvastatin-group will be given rosuvastatin 10 mg/day for 3 months and patients included in the Placebo-group will receive placebo 1 pill/day for 3 months.

At end of the 3-month follow-up period, patients will undergo repeat OCT of both renal arteries.

Sample size If we expect an incidence of 50% for each of the three primary endpoints (vasospasm, oedema or thrombus) in the control arm and hypothesize a 50% risk reduction of such incidence in the rosuvastatin arm, a total sample size of 112 patients would provide 80% power to detect this difference with an alpha level of 0.05.

Duration of the trial: 1 year

Primary End-point

Optical coherence tomography evidence of vascular injury induced by the radiofrequency energy, as detected by the evidence of at least one of the following 3 abnormalities:

* Presence (vs. absence) of local and diffuse vasospasm (i.e. as defined by immediate loss of lumen area or lumen diameter in any part of renal artery)
* Presence (vs.r absence) of oedema formation (i.e. as defined as any significant endothelial-intimal notch detected on the luminal wall surface)
* Presence (vs. absence) of endothelial injury (i.e. disruptions of the superficial intimal lining defined as endothelial detachments or vessel dissections) with thrombus generation (i.e. as a protruding mass attached to the luminal surface with a diameter of 0.5 mm in at least three following cross-sections)

Secondary End-points

* Comparison of the extent of vascular injury between the two catheter-based systems used for the study (EnligHTNTM vs. Simplicityw)
* Comparison vs. baseline of 24-hour and 48-hour post-procedural changes in CRP, creatinine. eGFR (as expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2), urine albumin:creatinine ratio, and absolute values of NGAL (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin).

Expected findings According to a previous preliminary experience with optical coherence tomography (Templin et al. Eur Heart J, 25 April 2012), the expected frequency of vascular injury in statin-naïve patients is 42% for vasospasm, 96% for oedema, and 67% for thrombus.

We expect a reduction of at least 25% in the frequency of abnormalities with pre-treatment with rosuvastatin.",UNKNOWN,,2014-01,2017-12,2016-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,112,ESTIMATED

The complication of myocardial fibrosis should be avoided in hypertensive heart disease, because increasing ventricular stiffness caused by myocardial fibrosis leads to the development of diastolic dysfunction of the heart. Diastolic dysfunction in patients with prolonged hypertension is often associated with myocardial fibrosis in addition to muscular hypertrophy as a final feature of hypertensive heart disease. The high risk of developing maladaptive cardiac remodeling during hypertension, and failure of pharmacological treatments to limit or even reverse this progressive stiffening of the myocardium, has led to the study of effects of Pycnogenol, a bioflavonoid-rich pine bark extract, with pleiotropic actions on cardiovascular system. Pycnogenol prevents adverse hypertension-induced myocardial remodeling in mice, through modulation of gene expression and activity of enzyme matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, affecting myocardial collagen degradation rate. Despite the mounting evidence suggesting the anti-remodeling effect of Pycnogenol in animal models, the clinical efficacy of Pycnogenol in hypertension-induced diastolic dysfunction is unreported. This leads to our central hypothesis that Pycnogenol reverses the hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients. Therefore in this clinical investigation, we will investigate the effects of Pycnogenol in modifying hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis (by measuring the serum markers of myocardial fibrosis and collagen turnover) and diastolic dysfunction (by transthoracic echocardiogram). We expect to improve diastolic function and ameliorate myocardial fibrosis with the nutritional supplement Pycnogenol, by modulation of MMPs and TIMPs enzyme activities.",TERMINATED,Not able to recruit qualified patents,2009-07,2011-07,2011-07,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,9,ACTUAL

NCT05091827,Cardiovascular Risk in Infants Exposed to Pre-eclampsia in Utero,Assessment of the Cardiovascular Risk Profile of Infants Exposed to Pre-eclampsia in Utero,"An increasing number of scientific publications show that high blood pressure is being described in younger and younger children of African ancestry. It therefore makes sense to seek for the causes of this raised blood pressure in the in utero events. Recent studies have attributed and increased risk to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to the gestational environment. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the mother which may influence how the developing foetus interacts with the external environment later on in life. Indeed scientific literature suggests that the foeto-placental vascular endothelial dysfunction may cause epigenetic alteration in the intrauterine environment of the foetus which may be at the origin of chronic diseases in children, thus predisposing them to risk factors of CVD. However, very few studies in women of African ancestry have been carried out to investigate whether or not children born of pre-eclamptic mothers of African ancestry are at risk of developing CVDs. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular risk in children born to pre-eclampsic mothers in a rural South African population. A prospective case-control control design recruiting pre-eclamptic and normotensive pregnant women and their offspring subsequently will be used. CVD risk will be accessed in the pregnant women at 30 weeks of gestation and in the offspring at birth and then six weeks later. The difference in CVD risk between children born to these two groups of women will be assessed and the correlation between maternal and offspring risks for CVDs determined. It is expected that results obtained from this project will provide information on the cardiovascular effect of in utero exposure to PE in a population of African ancestry. This knowledge will advise policy on the management of women with pre-eclampsia with a view of preventing cardiovascular diseases in the offspring. Furthermore, the project will afford the opportunity for scientific research capacity building in students in Walter Sisulu University and foster collaboration between clinical and fundamental researchers.","Study design This will be a prospective case-control study involving babies born to pre-eclamptic (cases) pregnant women as the case and babies born to normotensive mothers (control). The mothers will be recruited at the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This is a tertiary hospital to which all specialist cases are referred from the peripheral hospitals. Even though the prevalence of PE in South Africa is just over 5% nationally, 18% of all obstetric cases consulted in the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha are PE cases (unpublished data). It will therefore not be a great challenge to recruit the desired number of PE patients over the study period.

Sample size calculation The study done by Amini et al, (2010) showed blood pressure (BP) differences between neonates from normotensive and pre-eclamptic mothers5. The difference in blood systolic BP (SBP) was very high (normotensive: 49.85±5.49 versus pre-eclamptic: 68.2±149). Because the SBP variance and standard deviation were very high in the pre-eclamptic group, we decided to rather use the diastolic blood pressure values (normotensive: 30.17±11.89 versus pre-eclamptic: 42.11±11.49) for sample size calculation. The software - R was used: alpha = 0.01, mean difference = 11.94 and standard = 0.05 respectively were used. The results showed that total sample size is 97 (48 cases and 49 controls). We make the assumption that not all participants would return for the follow-up. Thus we adjusted our sample size by 20% to compensate for possible loses to follow-up. Therefore the total sample will be 97 + (97x20/100) = 117 neonates. However the study will start with the recruitment of 117 pregnant women (58 pre-eclamptic women and 59 normotensive pregnant women who meet the selection criteria).

NCT04451876,"Social Media Use ,Online Health Information Seeking and Knowledge on Hypertension","Social Media Use ,Online Health Information Seeking and Knowledge on Hypertension Among Undergraduate Students of Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)","The percentage of hypertension among adults aged 18 is relatively high which is about 30% in Malaysia. Uncontrolled hypertension will increase the risk of diseases especially cardiovascular disease. However, adults still lack awareness about the importance of knowledge of hypertension. In between, online health information seeking and the use of social media to gather health information have been quite a norm among students. The wide use of this platform has been proven in various researches and studies.

This study will be conducted among the undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM to look at the various socio-demographic factors associated with their level of knowledge on hypertension. Therefore, this may lead to a need to plan awareness programs on hypertension and to increase the knowledge of hypertension among health science students in the future. A cross-sectional study design will be done for this study. All undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM will be selected through simple random sampling. Online questionnaires will be given via the selected student email platform.

However, there are limitations for this study where we only focus on the students of FMHS, UPM. Hence, the results of this study may be limited to them only. The causal relationship cannot be determined by this study design as well. The purpose of this study is to determine the social media use, online health information seeking practices with knowledge on hypertension among undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM, and its associated factors","BACKGROUND Hypertension is a medical condition that acts as an important public health problem worldwide. It contributes to the disease which is mostly seen in primary health care settings such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death if it is not diagnosed as soon as possible. The World Health Organization (WHO) significantly mentions that an estimation of 1.13 billion people worldwide from poor countries where the healthcare system is weak have been detected with hypertension. Hypertension also puts an enormous financial pressure towards individuals and medical services via utilizing limited resources . Hypertension is predisposed to multiple factors. Such factors vary from country to country and there is also a disparity between urban and rural areas of the same location.

In Malaysia, 30% of adults above 18 have hypertension. Based on another study, it was proven that adults with uncontrolled hypertensive portrayed a higher risk of CVD mortality when compared to normotensive adults. It was reported that there were 3550 of them all caused hypertensive death and based on that 1027 are caused by cardiovascular disease; 771 are caused by heart-specific diseases and 256 by a cerebrovascular specific disease. However, untreated hypertension was stated to be the high risk of all caused death.

Based on a study by Grad I. et al, global knowledge on hypertension among adults is relatively low which is almost 49.2%. Whereas for medium knowledge on hypertension has 38% and only reported that 13% has higher knowledge on hypertension

. Besides, adults also have insufficient knowledge on epidemiology, method of treatment, and avoidance of hypertension(6).In addition, a good understanding of hypertension has also been linked with enhanced compliance with medications and good control of blood pressure.

According to Loiselle (1995), health information behavior is basically defined as a self-regulatory technique used by patients to coordinate transactions between self-related and health-related settings with the goal of balancing instrumental benefits and informative subjective costs. The students use electronic health knowledge to take some essential health-related decisions and actions. Students reported using the health details gathered more as a guide for lifestyle changes (72.4%) and the rest is dealing with healthcare practitioners online about the change in medication and guide of lifestyle changes.

WHO states that many people, primarily in the developing world, have access to online medical information, engage in online groups, buy well-being goods and services.

From the other side, hospital reports are often linked up by health agencies. The search for online health information has been on the increase and the knowledge gained has diverse influences on the healthcare outcomes of human beings. Based on a study conducted on 4504 respondents about mobile health use and perception among Malaysians in Selangor, only 1 in 5 respondents reported using some health-related application or mobile health device. The analysis of the health details that Malaysia is pursuing is still limited. From the point of view of scientific research, not much study has been done on different problems that occurred in the sense of finding health knowledge.

One of the interventional strategies to the elimination of health inequalities is by utilizing social media as a popular way to get health information. Depending on the concepts of loyalty and mutuality, social media promotes the sharing of life-enhancing services, such as health-related knowledge and social ties. In fact, social media sites are activating feedback systems that result in an enhanced degree of self-efficacy, which is vital in sustaining healthier behaviors and adhering to treatment. It becomes a mixture of direct contact and mainstream media which is personalized and responsive. Social networking media, including Facebook, one of the social media networking platforms, has such connectivity features in their architecture. As of 2004, it has been extremely popular with more than 350 million users around the world.

Non-communicable diseases constitute a worldwide crisis that contributes to more than 36 million (63 %) of all mortality globally. Almost 29 million (80%) of such deaths arise in low-and middle-income nations. Increasing use of social media implies a strategy to achieve scalability or even overcome barriers that often impede public health measures. For example, a smartphone-based home glucose monitoring service has been implemented through which community health professionals have given clinical advice for diabetic patients through smartphones.

The social media use, health information seeking, and knowledge on hypertension in Malaysia are not well studied. It is beneficial to have an overview of the social media use, health information seeking and knowledge on hypertension among the students of Faculty of Medicine and Health Science (FMHS), UPM because they are individuals who will work in a healthcare setting in the near future.

In conclusion, knowledge of hypertension is relatively very important to reduce the prevalence of hypertension and to create more awareness among the public. Ways of getting knowledge and online health information like social media are important as it is becoming a popular form of information. This study will be conducted among the students in FMHS, UPM because of the variety of sociodemographic factors present that will be a platform to see the association between the factors and their level of knowledge on hypertension. Moreover, this may be a good start to plan an awareness program on Hypertension and also initiate programs to increase the knowledge of hypertension among the students.

STUDY OBJECTIVE General Objective To determine the social media use, online health information seeking and knowledge on hypertension among students in FMHS, UPM.

Specific Objective I. To determine the socio-demographic factors (age, gender, race, family income status, undergraduate course and year of study) of students of FMHS, UPM. II. To determine the social media use of students among FMHS, UPM. III. To determine the online health information-seeking behavior on hypertension among students of FMHS, UPM. IV. To determine the level of knowledge on hypertension among students of FMHS, UPM. V. To study the association of socio-demographic factors, social media use and online health information seeking on the knowledge of hypertension.

STUDY INSTRUMENTS Study instruments include a questionnaire adapted from a previously published questionnaire. The questionnaire to assess the social media use and health information seeking was adapted from a study about Health Information Seeking and Social Media Use on the Internet among people with Diabetes. The hypertension knowledge questionnaire was adapted from a tool developed to assess hypertension knowledge among urban patients. This questionnaire is prepared in English and is divided into four parts.",COMPLETED,,2020-08-17,2020-10-30,2020-08-24,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,286,ACTUAL
NCT03401476,Effect of Morphine on Dyspnea and 6-Minute Walk Distance in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,Effect of Morphine on Dyspnea and 6-Minute Walk Distance in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Despite advances in treatment and corresponding improvements in survival, patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain highly symptomatic. In one survey of 315 patients with PAH, sixty-eight percent had moderate or severe dyspnea on exertion and 40% had a profound and clinically significant deficit in quality of life. Palliative care is being increasingly investigated in life-limiting cardiovascular diseases to alleviate symptoms. In PAH, its implementation is frequently delayed until end-of-life. Opioids are a common palliative care intervention, however the efficacy and safety of opioids for symptom relief in PAH has not been evaluated.","There is biologic plausibility for opioids in the treatment of dyspnea in PAH. Opioids have widespread effects including venodilation, vasodilation, reducing sympathetic outflow, blunting hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses, and altering the central perception of dyspnea. Although the origins of dyspnea in PAH are incompletely understood and multifactorial, right ventricular dysfunction reduces exercise capacity and likely also plays a role in the development of dyspnea. Mechanoreceptors situated in the right atrium and right ventricle sense elevated pressures and via sympathetic afferents may lead to an augmentation of ventilatory response and hence dyspnea. Morphine may specifically antagonize this feedback loop by causing venodilation and blunting sympathetics. Morphine also reduces central chemosensitivity and perceptions of dyspnea. Therefore, the drug may antagonize both peripheral and central drivers of dyspnea in PAH.

Investigators will conduct a single-center feasibility study of morphine for treatment of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in PAH. Participants will complete two 6-minute walk tests (6MWT) within one week. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive morphine prior to either the first or second 6MWT. Symptoms and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) will be compared between the two tests.",UNKNOWN,,2017-05-08,2019-12-31,2018-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,TREATMENT,15,ESTIMATED

NCT04861727,Use of Technology to Optimize Hypertension Treatment in Elderly People in Primary Care,Use of Technology to Optimize Hypertension Treatment in Elderly People in Primary Care,"The control of blood pressure (BP) in the elderly is influenced by several factors, among them, the measurement methodology. The measurement of BP in the office is prone to failures, so the use of technology associated with blood pressure measurements at home is an alternative to minimize failures and contribute to the optimization of treatment. The objective of this study will be to evaluate the adequacy of the treatment of Systemic Arterial Hypertension (SAH) in primary care using Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (MRPA). Method: Randomized clinical trial with hypertensive patients, aged 60 years or over, attended at the Family Pharmacy service inserted in the primary care of the municipal health network. The subjects who accept to participate in the study will be randomized to the intervention / control groups. submitted to MRPA, will undergo analysis of the pharmacotherapy prescribed for the treatment of SAH, collection of clinical data, which together will support the assessment of the adequacy of the treatment of hypertension. When inadequacies in pharmacotherapy are identified, suggestions for changes will be forwarded to the prescriber / professional or assistant health team, weighted by the pharmacist in agreement with the patient and according to the guidelines of the Brazilian Guideline on Hypertension. The outcomes: changes in treatment and blood pressure control in the intervention and control groups will be evaluated.","The study will be carried out at a municipal public pharmacy. The subjects will be users of the Family Pharmacy, aged 60 years or over, who seek the service to remove the drugs prescribed for the treatment of Systemic Arterial Hypertension. In order to calculate the sample for this study, the incidence of patients with Hypertension System who need treatment adjustments (under- or over-treatment) will be considered. It is expected that in the intervention group, MRPA indicates that 30% of patients will need to change their pharmacotherapy and, in the control group, using the office measure, 10%. For a two-tailed test with 80% power, 5% sampling error and 95% confidence level, the sample will be 160 users in the intervention group and 160 in the control group. Considering the pandemic of COVID-19 and the risk of infection during care in health services, whether from patients or health professionals from the health care network, the Family Pharmacy already adopts the screening for respiratory symptoms that identify suspected infection by Sars-Cov-2.To minimize the impact of selection and information bias, the following procedure will be used to select individuals: during attendance at the windows, each trained attendant will invite patients with eligibility criteria, when they accept, they will be inserted in the service schedule. The selection for control group and intervention group will take place by drawing from the list of scheduled people, with 3 participants being drawn for the Intervention Group, totaling 160 participants in each group. Data collection will only occur after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF). The Control Group will be attended by Pharmacists and will have the data collected according to the standard collection instrument, will receive general guidance on blood pressure control and pharmacotherapy assessment. The Intervention Group, in addition to the control group procedures, will also perform the MRPA, the result of which will guide the pharmaceutical suggestions, when necessary, they also received a Letter of Referral to the Prescriber containing pharmaceutical suggestions for optimization of pharmacotherapy, considering the current clinical protocols. In the service, patients and companions will be instructed on preventive measures against Sars-coV-2 infection, in addition to performing hand hygiene with water and liquid soap or 70% alcohol gel. The office will undergo cleaning before and after use, as well as the material, in addition to adopting the time of 15 minutes between appointments, maintaining the ventilation of the room, following all the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Pharmaceutical evaluation is already a routine of the service. For the purposes of this research, the procedures will be added to standardized instruments and routines to guarantee methodological quality and answer the questions of this research. The Data Collection Form (Appendix I) will be used, which includes the collection of data related to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. In order to assess adherence, the Portuguese version of the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) will be used in two stages: during the initial evaluation, when the patient was included in the research and 45 days after the intervention.

The pharmaceutical suggestion procedure, for this research, is defined as forwarding a letter of suggestion to the prescriber, previously agreed with the patient, based on clinical evaluation, review of pharmacotherapy, adherence to treatment and result of the MRPA procedure. The definition of the conducts to be adopted will be based on the 8th Brazilian Guideline on Systemic Arterial Hypertension, and in a complementary way - as it is an elderly patient (60 years old or more) - by the Brazilian Consensus on Potential Medicines Inappropriate for the Elderly.

The data will be tabulated and analyzed using the SPPS® Statistic 25 software. The Kolmogorov-Sminorv test will be used to assess the data distribution. The paired T test will be used to assess the differences between BP measurements in the office and the MRPA mean. Continuous variables with normal distribution will be presented as means, standard deviations and Odds Ratio. Categorical variables will be presented as a proportion, using the Chi-square test. Values of p \<0.05 will be considered significant.

To compare the proportion of patients with controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure, before and after application of the intervention, the chi-square test (χ2) will be used.

PPAR-γ is a nuclear hormone receptor and functions as a regulator of lipid- and glucose metabolism. PPAR-γ ligands improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.

Angiotensin II receptor 1-blocking and PPAR-γ-activating properties of losartan metabolites in patients would markedly improve the pharmacological profile of losartan by combining anti-hypertensive and highly beneficial metabolic actions. We developed the following hypothesis:

NCT06214676,OCTA in Patients With Primary Open-angle Glaucoma,Detection of Microvascular Changes in Patients With Primary Open Angle Glaucoma by Using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography,Is to investigate retinal microvascular changes in primary open angle glaucoma patients using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive imaging technique developed to visualize vascular networks in the retina and choroid. It utilizes low-coherence interferometry to measure changes in backscattered signal to differentiate areas of blood flow from areas of static tissue.

OCTA provides both structural and functional (i.e. blood flow) information in tandem. The ""corresponding"" OCT b-scans can be co-registered with the simultaneous OCT angiograms so the operator is able to scroll through the OCT angiogram like a cube scan. As a result, the precise location of pathology can be viewed on the corresponding OCT b-scans. This makes OCTA a better tool when detecting the exact location of a retinal pathology.

Glaucoma is the first cause of irreversible blindness and represents approximately 15% of all causes of blindness . This makes it a real public health problem. In 2020, glaucoma affected about 80 million people worldwide, with nearly 75% of open-angle glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive, blinding, irreversible optic neuropathy characterized by damage to the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibers with subsequent visual field defects ,elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a crucial glaucoma risk factor that causes direct damage to RGCs and the optic nerve . Moreover, glaucomatous retinsl ganglion cells loss occurs as well in people with normal IOP, implying mechanisms behind pressure-mediated damage. RGCs death may be due to the reduced blood supply and microvasculature dysfunction may be essential in glaucoma pathogenesis .

One hypothesis is that POAG is categorized by impaired chemical endothelial signaling between both: a) the inner wall Schlemm's canal endothelial cells as well as endothelial cells located in the ciliary body and the posterior longitudinal muscle that helps to set outflow resistance and b) the ocular vascular endothelial cell and underlying luminal smooth muscle for vessels supplying the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This hypothesis could explain why POAG occurs across a spectrum of IOP but it does not consider the role systemic endothelial cell dysfunction may play in the disease.

The non-invasive technique of OCT angiography (OCTA) can image and quantify both large vessels and the microvasculature of the optic nerve head (ONH), retina and choroid layers . Using the OCTA technique, reduced vessel density (VD) was observed in the ONH, peripapillary area and macula, predominantly in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-04,2025-02,2025-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,30,ESTIMATED

NCT01526876,The Effect of Clevidipine on Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CCP) in Brain Injured Patients,"Effect of Clevidipine on Intracranial Pressure, Cerebral Blood Flow, Brain Tissue Oxygenation and Brain Cellular Metabolism in Severely Hypertensive Patients With Acute Brain Injury","Patients with acute brain injury are at risk for complications such as increased pressure in the brain (intracranial pressure (ICP)), decreased blood flow, bleeding, and brain swelling (cerebral edema). Several studies have suggested that high blood pressure is associated with a worsening outcome possibly due to an increased rate of continued bleeding or rebleeding, as well as increased brain swelling (cerebral edema). High systemic (body) blood pressure (SBP) may also increase the risk of ongoing bleeding. Therefore lowering the blood pressure (BP) is critical, as continued bleeding occurs most frequently in patients with high BP.

Clevidipine Butyrate (Cleviprex) is a new medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute high blood pressure (hypertension). Cleviprex is given through an intravenous line (IV) and has the benefit of being faster acting and easier to control adjustments than other drugs used to treat high BP. Patients who have an acute brain injury and who have severe high BP may benefit from this faster acting medication.

For this study, eligible patients, 18 yrs of age or older, will have been admitted to the Neurocritical care unit within 24 hours after their brain injury, who have high systemic (body) SBP. The treating physicians will have already had multimodality brain monitoring placed for clinical management of the patient (standard care).

The investigators will use Cleviprex to lower their SBP and record brain pressure and brain blood flow measurements from the multimodality monitoring. Due to the severity of their brain injury most of the patients eligible for the study will be unable to provide consent. Informed consent will be sought from a surrogate (family member, spouse or close friend) according to Columbia University Medical Center guidelines.

Cleviprex is fast acting and effects are seen in about 90 seconds. The medication will be started at a low rate, and if the SBP still needs lowering, the dose increased every 90 seconds until the maximum FDA approved dose is reached. If the SBP is still high, another medication used to treat high blood pressure will be added (Cardene or labetolol).

Once the SBP is lowered and is stable, the Cleviprex will be continued for 6 hours. As part of standard care, patients have their blood pressure monitored continuously. After 6 hours the treating physician will make a determination to continue clinical management with cleviprex or another antihypertensive medication.","This is an open-label, single arm, single center study in patients with hypertension in the setting of an acute brain injury. Approximately 15 patients admitted to the Columbia University Neurocritical Care Unit with intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury who are hypertensive and have neuromonitoring probes placed in the course of standard clinical management will be enrolled over a 10-12 month period. Patients must be hypertensive (SBP \> 180mmHg), or have an elevated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 100 mm Hg and the decision has been made by the ICU team to initiate an infusion of clevidipine to maintain CPP within a target range of 70-90 mm Hg and SBP between 120-180mmHg.

Due to the decreased level of consciousness from their injury, the majority of patients will be unable to provide consent. Informed consent will be sought from a surrogate according to Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) guidelines (See section 8-Informed Consent Process).

Clevidipine infusion will be used to treat hypertension within the first 24 hours after injury. Multi-modality brain monitoring will have been placed as standard care.

Clevidipine will be infused at an initial rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 90 seconds and titrated to effect (CPP target range of 70-90 mm Hg) by either doubling or reducing the dose by 50% every 90 seconds (with dose ranging 0-32mg/h of continuous IV infusion).

At the end of 6 hours clevidipine treatment, the treating physician will make a determination to continue clinical management with clevidipine or change to another antihypertensive medication.

This increase is connected in part to a growing number of people who are overweight and do not eat right or exercise enough. In younger children though, high blood pressure is a common consequence of underlying diseases, such as renal diseases.

This study looked at a blood pressure medicine called TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) to see how it works in children who have hypertension. Azilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that converts into TAK-536 (azilsartan), a blood pressure lowering medicine that had not been tested in children.

To be eligible to take part in this study, children with a diagnosis of hypertension (primary or secondary) must have been between the ages of 1 year and 16 years old (up to their 17th birthday). Each child was given one dose of azilsartan medoxomil, followed by a number of blood tests and assessments within 24 hours after taking azilsartan medoxomil to see how the medication is working. Adults who do not have hypertension also took part in this study to provide comparison.

This study took place in 9 sites in the UK and USA. A total of 20 children with hypertension and 9 adults without hypertension participated in this study.

This study lasted about 43 days. This included a 28 day screening period, a 2 day treatment phase and a follow up period. Each participant taking part in this study may have been requested to remain in a hospital for one overnight stay during the course of the study.

Treatment time is from the start of surgery up to 24 hours.,"Endothelin-1 levels are increased during and after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and are associated with many deleterious consequences, including increased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), reduced myocardial contractility, and ultimately right ventricular failure. Right ventricular failure during weaning from CPB increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, especially in patients with elevated PAP prior to cardiac surgery. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been shown to decrease PVR and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and improve right ventricular function in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In animal models, ERAs have been shown to decrease the incidence of post-bypass pulmonary hypertensive crises.

NCT01008176,Restoring Sleep Homeostasis to Lower Blood Pressure,Restoring Sleep Homeostasis to Lower Blood Pressure: A Behavioral Prevention and Treatment Approach,"Cutting back on sleep duration has developed into a common, highly prevalent habit in the adult population, and may lead to a major health problem. Large epidemiological studies have demonstrated that short sleep duration is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The investigators' preliminary data on the effects of experimental sleep reduction have shown elevation of blood pressure (BP) and inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C reactive protein (CRP), suggesting that both may play an important role in linking sleep loss and CVD risk. With this background, the investigators hypothesize that restoring sleep homeostasis, i. e. getting adequate amounts of sleep, is an effective behavioral intervention in the treatment of elevated BP.

The investigators will test this hypothesis in subjects with BP above normal and with short habitual sleep duration, as verified by sleep logs and actigraphic recordings. Subjects will either undergo 6 weeks of mild sleep extension, in which 60 min of bedtime will be added to the habitual sleep duration, or subjects will maintain their habitual sleep duration for the following 6 weeks.

Regarding their first specific aim, the investigators expect that sleep extension across 6 weeks will lower BP, inflammatory (IL-6, CRP, cell adhesion molecules) and autonomic markers (catecholamines). In particular, the investigators expect that in subjects with mild BP elevation, i. e. with pre-hypertension, sleep extension leads to normalization of BP.

This study presents a very first approach in using sleep behavior components for the treatment of elevated BP. Therefore, the investigators' second specific aim will characterize the strength of associations between changes in sleep duration, BP, and inflammation, and they will explore factors that are predictive for these changes. In particular, adiposity, as measured by percent body fat, has frequently been shown to be related to short sleep duration and inflammatory processes, but the role of adiposity in modulating the physiological consequences of changes in sleep duration has never been addressed.

If the investigators' hypothesis is correct, sleep extension may be considered as an additional component in current lifestyle intervention programs in combating and preventing hypertension.",,COMPLETED,,2005-09,2012-06,2012-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,23,ACTUAL

Pulmonary hypertension associated with CDH is frequently resistant to conventional pulmonary vasodilator therapy including inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can lead to right ventricular overload and dysfunction. In patients with CDH, left ventricular dysfunction, either caused by right ventricular overload or a relative underdevelopment of the left ventricle, is associated with poor prognosis.

NCT04143620,Triple Procedure for Dense Cataractus Neovascular Glaucoma Patients,Triple Procedure for Dense Cataractus Neovascular Glaucoma Patients,"Background: One of the most difficult refractory glaucomas in treatment is the neovascular type and its association with dense cataract add to this difficulty. This study aimed to provide results of triple surgical treatment of such conditions.

Methods: A total of 12 eyes of 12 patients with dense cataractus NVG patients were included in this study. The patients mean age was 57.25 ± 5.9 years. The mean pre-operative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 47.25 ± 4.04 mmHg with maximum antiglaucoma therapy. The mean best corrected distant visual acuities (BCDVA) in log MAR was 2.13 ± 0.38. All the patients received intra-vitreal injection of 1.25 mg (0.05 ml) bevacizumab followed by phacoemulsification, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) including pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP), and assisted trabeculectomy with Mitomycin c (MMC). Mean IOP and BCDVA changes were the main outcome results of this study.","Introduction Ocular ischemia due to diabetic retinopathy (DR) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) are the most common causes that contribute to the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG). Ischemic retina derived factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that can affect the anterior segment and initiates neovascularization in the iris (NVI), neovascularization in the angle (NVA). Aqueous outflow is obstructed when neovascular fibrous tissues block the trabecular meshwork and leads to synechial angle closure, thus NVG develops. Intraocular pressure (IOP) rise due to NVG lowers the ocular perfusion leading to further retinal ischemia, and this in turn induces more neovascularization. The management of NVG is very difficult thus; the conventional treatments such as antiglaucoma drugs, trabeculectomy, cyclophotocoagulation and cyclocryotherapy have poor success rates. It is very important to reduce the ischemic drive promptly for the treatment of NVG. Pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) is a mandatory and effective in resolving the ischemic condition and decreasing the vasoproliferative factors production.\[ This management is particularly difficult in eyes with dense cataract. However, it is possible to overcome this difficulty by doing phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) + PRP. Moreover, phacoemulsification combined with PPV enables us to apply PRP from the posterior pole to the ora serrata peripherally. It has been known that Mitomycin C (MMC) increase the success rate of trabeculectomy in patients with NVG. Therefore, in the current study, we performed Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection, phacoemulsification, PPV + PRP and trabeculectomy augmented with subconjunctival injection of MMC.

The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of this combined surgical procedure to alleviate retinal ischemia, reduce IOP, and improve visual acuity in dense cataractus NVG patients.

Subjects and Methods

Twelve eyes of 12 patients with NVG associated with dense cataract enough to obscure fundus visualization (7 males, 5 females) were included in the study in the period from July 2016 to August 2019 at Ophthalmology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University. The patient's age ranged from 47 to 66 years with a mean age of 57.25 ± 5.9 years. The underlying cause for NVG was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 8 eyes (75%) and CRVO in 4 eyes (33.33%). Vitreous hemorrhage was present in half (50%) of the patients. The study was approved by the Local Ethical Review Committee and adhered to the tents of Declaration of Helsinki as well as all patients singed a written consent after discussion of the potential benefits and risks of this triple surgical procedures.

Preoperative examinations: Routine ophthalmological examinations were done after history taking including, age, sex, laterality, etiology of NVG and number of used anti-glaucoma drugs. The ocular examination includes estimation of visual acuity, IOP measurement with Goldman applanation tonometer, slit lamp examination of anterior segment, gonioscopy examination of angle of anterior chamber, biometry and ultrasonography. The demographic data were registered as in (Table 1).

Surgical procedures . In brief: - All procedures were done under peribulbar anesthesia with mild systemic sedation. IVB injection of 1.25 mg (0.05 ml) was given 2-6 days before surgery using a 27-gauge needle at the inferotemporal quadrant at 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus. Preoperative IV mannitol was given to all cases to lower IOP before surgery beside the full anti-glaucoma drugs including: topical Dorzolamide-Timolol combination, Brimonidine tartrate and oral Acetazolamide (250 mg) three times a day. Subconjunctival injection of MMC in a dose of 0.04mg/ml was done, and a period of 4 minutes was left before Conjunctival opening.

Fornix based Conjunctival incision was performed and a rectangular scleral flap of 3x4 mm was dissected. Separate temporal clear corneal incision phacoemulsification was done with intrabagal one-piece hydrophobic IOL implantation. Then, incision was closed with 10/0 nylon suture. This was followed by three ports 25-G PPV including core vitrectomy, injection of triamcinolone acetonide, induction of PVD, shaving of vitreous base, and dealing with any epiretinal membranes. PRP using diode endo-laser was done up to the far periphery (2000-3000 shots, duration 200 ms; power 400 mw). Fluid-air exchange was then performed and 20% SF6 was injected leaving 10 cc of gas to adjust pressure at the end of surgery. Then, the upper sclerotomies were sutured by vicryl 7/0 and the infusion cannula was left in place connected to the syringe of 20% SF6. Then, Healon was injected into the anterior chamber to maintain depth of anterior chamber and trabeculectomy by Kelly punch and peripheral iridectomy were done. Scleral flap was sutured by two 10/0 nylon sutures at the corners followed by watertight Conjunctival wound closure. More SF6 was injected to adjust IOP and the infusion cannula was removed, and its site was sutured with vicryl 7/0 suture. At the end of surgery, fluid was injected into the AC to test for filtration of bleb and to make sure that the conjunctiva was closed watertight. At last, triamcinolone acetonide subtenon injection was given to all eyes.

Post-operative management: The patients were prescribed prednisolone 1% (predfort, Alcon Co.) eye drops QID and tapered through 8 weeks, cyclopentolate 0.5 % TID, moxifloxacin 0.3 mg (Vigamox, Alcon Co.) eye drops QID for 2 weeks and ointment of tobramycin and dexamethasone at night for 4 weeks. Scheduled follow up visits were advised next postoperative day, one week, two weeks, monthly for three months, and then each three months for 2 years.

All patients underwent full ophthalmologic examination including BCDVA, IOP, gonioscopy, slit lamp examination, and dilated fundus examination. Antiglaucoma medications were prescribed if IOP was more than 21 mmHg. Baseline results and that of 1, 3 and 6 months, 1 and 2 years were included in the statistical analysis. This study main outcome measures were the mean BCDVA (log MAR), the mean IOP and the incidence of complications. Successful surgery was considered when the target IOP =21 mmHg was achieved without serious complications such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage, choroidal effusion, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, phthisis bulbi, or persistent hypotony (IOP \<5 mmHg). Complete success was considered when IOP of 6 -21 mmHg was achieved without any anti-glaucoma drugs, and qualified success when this target IOP was achieved with and without the use of anti-glaucoma drugs. Failure was defined as IOP \>21 mmHg despite the use of maximum tolerated medications, hypotony, or the need for another glaucoma surgery.

Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Changes in the mean BCDVA and the mean IOP were compared for each follow up visit with baseline using paired t test and graphs construction done by using Graph Pad Prism 5 program. P value \< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",COMPLETED,,2016-07-01,2019-08-31,2019-08-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,12,ACTUAL
NCT06436820,ICP & Outflow Study,The Relationship Between Intracranial Pressure and Aqueous Outflow in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,"This study aims to investigate the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and aqueous outflow (the flow of the eye's internal fluid out of the eye), in patients with increased intracranial pressure (idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)).

Through observing changes in aqueous outflow facility in patients scheduled for lumbar Puncture (LP) as part of their routine care the objectives we aim to answer include:

* Investigating the effect of lumbar puncture induced reduction in ICP on patients with known or suspected IIH, compared to control patients, who will be receiving LP for reasons not pertaining to high pressure.
* Comparing pre lumbar puncture aqueous outflow facility between patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and control patients.

Outside of the standard care provided for these patients as part of their scheduled lumbar puncture, they will have measurements of their eye taken before and after their lumbar puncture.","This study aims to investigate the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and aqueous outflow (the flow of the eye's internal fluid out of the eye), in patients with increased intracranial pressure (idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)).

The effect of lowering intracranial pressure on aqueous outflow will be examined by taking additional measurements before and after a procedure called a lumbar puncture (LP). These measurements include a scan to measure the dimensions of the eye, intraocular pressure reading, and a non-invasive technique to measure aqueous outflow (electronic Schiotz tonography) which is used regularly in the eye research unit at St Thomas' Hospital.

Study participants will already be scheduled for a lumbar puncture as they have known or suspected IIH, and LP is routinely used to investigate this. Additionally, control participants having LP for reasons not pertaining to a condition that may elevate intracranial pressure will also be included. Study participants will finish their involvement following the second aqueous outflow reading, after their LP.

A lumbar puncture procedure directly measures the intracranial pressure, but also reduces the pressure in the process. If aqueous outflow is measured before and after lumbar puncture, it will provide more information about whether the change in intracranial pressure affects the intraocular pressure due to a change in the rate of fluid flowing out of the eye. If a relationship between intracranial pressure and aqueous outflow is found to be present, it may offer an alternative non-invasive measurement for intracranial pressure. Additionally, this study would highlight an avenue of investigation into dysregulation of intraocular pressure in conditions such as glaucoma. Similarly, negative findings would help inform ongoing discussions and controversies in the literature regarding relationships between intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-06,2025-11,2025-11,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,66,ESTIMATED

NCT00194974,Treatment Targets for Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy,Treatment Targets for Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy,"This project is a clinical study of women with high blood pressure who become pregnant. Preeclampsia is a syndrome developing at the end of a pregnancy characterized by an abrupt rise in blood pressure (BP), blood clotting and kidney dysfunction, and may result in premature delivery, infant death, and maternal bleeding, kidney failure and stroke. The goal is to determine whether lowering blood pressure to a normal pressure of 120/80 is associated with a lower incidence of preeclampsia. Women who are completely healthy have a 5% chance of developing preeclampsia, however women with preexisting high blood pressure have a 25% chance of this complication. Several studies, including our own suggest that higher blood pressure early in pregnancy (\<20 weeks) is associated with an even higher risk of preeclampsia. Currently we, the researchers at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, do not know how to treat women with high blood pressure and/or kidney disease during pregnancy. Keeping the BP in the normal range may be beneficial to the mother. On the other hand, we are not sure if the blood pressure lowering or the medications may or may not have adverse effects for the baby. Different trials to answer this question have been performed with no clear conclusions. Because of these uncertainties, we propose to compare two different strategies for treating women with high BP who become pregnant. We will treat half the women with BP medications to normalize BP (120-130/80 mm Hg) (experimental group) and the other half with the goal of keeping the BP slightly higher (140-150/90-100 mm Hg)(standard therapy group). We will determine which approach results in healthier pregnancies, and lower incidence of preeclampsia. Reducing the incidence of preeclampsia would be of significant benefit to both mothers and babies.","Methods:

This is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of conducting a larger, multi center randomized control trial. Fifty women with chronic hypertension who are pregnant and are seen in the first trimester of pregnancy will be recruited from the offices of obstetricians at New York Presbyterian Hospital.

Recruitment:

First trimester (up to 13 6/7th weeks)

Stratified by:

* Parity (primiparous vs. multiparous delivering a fetus \>20 weeks gestation)
* Severity of hypertension (\>150/95) as determined on screening antepartum visit

Inclusion Criteria:

1. Pregnant patients will be evaluated for recruitment to 13 6/7 weeks gestation.
2. Age 18-50
3. Patients will be included for consideration to enter this trial if office blood pressure is \>140/90 mm Hg: systolic \>140 mm Hg, diastolic \>90 mm Hg or both. The average of 3 readings taken a minimum of 5 minutes apart will be recorded as the baseline blood pressure.
4. Patients will also be included for consideration to enter this trial if they have known longstanding hypertension diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \>90 within 2 years of index pregnancy and/or are on antihypertensive medication, regardless of in-office blood pressure if seen in their first trimester.

Exclusion Criteria:

Significant target organ damage; at the patient's initial antepartum visit, routine serum creatinine and urine dipstick for protein are performed by the attending obstetrician. If the patient has been hypertensive by history for over 5 years, a screening electrocardiogram will be performed. These will be reviewed for results precluding participation in the trial.

1. Known renal disease creatinine \> 1.2 mg/dl
2. Proteinuria \>500 mg/day at baseline
3. Left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiography (ECG) criteria.
4. History of the following: chronic illness requiring immunosuppression, as well as secondary causes of hypertension: pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, coarctation of aorta, renal artery stenosis not revascularized.

NB: the presence of the above conditions would make it more likely that a clinician would treat blood pressure during pregnancy. Therefore, the patient may be randomized and treatment begun as per protocol prior to complete evaluation of presence of above conditions; if exclusion criteria are subsequently identified the patient would then be excluded and treated according to individual physicians standard of practice.

Enrollment:

Patients will undergo initial baseline evaluation. History and physical will be performed. Weight, height and blood pressure will be recorded.

Eligible patients will sign informed consent. Each patient will have a data sheet for the purpose of recording study results.

Randomization:

Patients will be randomized to one of two blood pressure targets:

120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg

Randomization will occur by blocked randomization in blocks of 6. Randomization is stratified for parity (nulliparous vs. multiparous) and severe vs. non-severe hypertension. There are therefore 4 potential groups:

1. Nulliparous + non-severe hypertension
2. Multiparous + non-severe hypertension
3. Nulliparous + severe hypertension
4. Multiparous + severe hypertension

There are 54 envelopes for each group (allowing for the theoretic possibility that all patients may fall into one group) and envelopes are numbered and will be opened sequentially to allocate patients during the randomization process.

Treatment:

Patients with no prior history of hypertension will be treated as per the protocol described below.

Patients with a known history of hypertension will still be randomized to the appropriate group according to parity and blood pressure in clinic, but will be asked to stop their antihypertensive medication for a wash out period.

The patient will then return to clinic three to seven days later off medication to have a repeat blood pressure measurement. If they own a home blood pressure monitor and this has been calibrated to office equipment, they may take their blood pressure at home.

They will be then be treated as per their randomization group i.e. to a blood pressure of 120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg as per the protocol below.

The patient will be given a diary to record obstetric data and blood pressure data. Duplicate records will be kept by the patient and physician.

Weight, blood pressure, pulse, presence or absence of edema and urinary protein will be recorded at each visit.

Medication Protocol:

Treatment is to commence immediately after randomization unless the patient is undergoing a washout period described above.

Some patients will initially require no medication as BP's may be below the treatment threshold, depending on their treatment group.

Treatment will be with methyldopa, labetolol, long acting nifedipine, hydralazine or clonidine.

Scheduled Visits:

Patients will be followed every two to four weeks until delivery. Medication will be titrated to achieve the desired blood pressure targets. Patients will not be billed for these visits.

The achievement of target blood pressure will be assessed by an average of three blood pressure measurements obtained at every six weeks visits: weeks 20, 26, 32 and 38.

At the 20 week visit, routine blood work will be drawn to evaluate uric acid and plasma renin activity as validation of the prediction algorithm.

Home Blood Pressure Monitoring:

If patients own a home blood pressure monitor, they will be asked to bring it into clinic for calibration. They will be given a blood pressure diary to record home blood pressure monitoring or BP measurements done in another clinic or pharmacy.

Duration of Treatment:

The treatment goals of 120-130/80 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90 mm Hg will be applied from the time of randomization until delivery. Postpartum, clinicians will choose their own blood pressure goals as per JNC-7 guidelines.

Assessment of Outcomes:

For the pilot trial, maternal blood pressure is the primary outcome. This will be measured at weeks 20, 26, 32, 36 using a standardized method: after 15 minutes of rest, blood pressure will be measured with the woman seated, arm supported at heart level, bladder of cuff encircling \>80% of arm circumference and phase V Korotkoff used for diastolic reading. Blood pressure will be recorded three times, five minutes apart, and the mean of these values will allow assessment of BP control in the study.

Secondary outcomes:

1. The incidence of superimposed preeclampsia in chronically hypertensive women. Diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia will be made by the following criteria:

   * Worsening hypertension after 20 weeks
   * AND proteinuria \>.3g/day on 24 hour collection when there was previously none OR doubling of proteinuria, in those positive at baseline
   * AND/OR the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis on blood smear, liver transaminase levels \> 2 x normal, low platelets \<100/mm3).
2. Gestational age
3. Birth weight \< 10th centile for gestational age

Then the optimal noninvasive indicator for identify PH was determined and its critical point was obtained according to the Youden Index. Based on this, we investigate the proportion, risk factors and prognosis of PH in idiopathic bronchiectasis patients in another large-scale population.","Between April 2011 and December 2019, the data of idiopathic bronchiectasis patients were analyzed to determine the optimal noninvasive tool to identify PH. Based on the patients who received RHC examination, Spearman correlation was used to assess the correlation between mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) measured by RHC and other noninvasive indicators (estimated PASP assessed by echocardiography, main pulmonary artery (MPA) diameter and MPA/ ascending aorta (AA) ratio on chest HRCT scan), in order to screening out the optimal indicator to identify PH.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of non-curable blindness globally. Patients with glaucoma will get a gradual narrowing of the visual fields caused by compression at the optic nerve head due to increased intraocular pressure. Thus the main preventive strategy is to reduce intraocular pressure, initially by eye drops and/or laser treatment but in some patients surgery is warranted. The surgical procedure (trabeculectomy) most widely performed worldwide creates a path from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space and thereby lowers the IOP by producing a more efficient drainage of the aqueous humour. Surgical success depends upon controlling post-operative inflammation to ensure a functional drainage. The purpose of this blinded, randomized study is to investigate which anti-inflammatory treatment provides better long-term control of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) following glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy) by comparing topical NSAIDs to topical steroids. Additionally, we want to explore the mechanisms behind the pathophysiology of glaucoma by evaluating retinal and optic nerve head perfusion before and after IOP lowering surgery. The primary outcome is the intraocular pressure 12 months after surgery measured by applanation tonometry.

MAIN HYPOTHESIS:

* NSAIDs and steroids are equally effective in assuring long-term filtering function and controlling IOP after trabeculectomy but may be associated with different risk profiles and bleb morphology
* Patients with lower post-operative IOP demonstrate less progression of visual field loss
* Trabeculectomy lowers IOP and provides better microcirculation in and oxygenation of inner retinal layers (i.e. ganglion cell layer) and the optic nerve head",,UNKNOWN,,2019-08-01,2023-07,2022-06-15,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,PREVENTION,70,ACTUAL

Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1.) standard of care (SOC) treatment or 2.) SOC plus a 6 week CR program.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic auto-immune disease characterized by inflammation and structural damage in synovial joints, but also has extra-articular involvements such as the cardiovascular system. RA patients have higher mortality rates than the general population, and approximately half of premature deaths are due to cardiovascular comorbidities. Traditional risk factors, especially hypertension (HTN), play a key role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

In chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA, autoimmunity is a cause of HTN as well as a result of physical damage to the vascular wall. Mild blood pressure elevation caused by specific HTN triggers such as salt retention, angiotensin-II or genetic susceptibility leads to neoantigen release through tissue damage. These neoantigens are recognized by antigen-presenting cells and lead to the differentiation of CD4+ naïve-T lymphocytes into Th1 and Th17 cells. IL-17 and IFN-γ expression causes local inflammation in the vascular wall, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness. Thus, HTN causes an increase in CVD risk through a common pathogenesis mechanism with RA.

European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations emphasize that rheumatologists should be responsible for CVD risk management in RA. However, both RA and HTN treatment is generally administered pharmacologically without focusing on CVD risk. Patients may be recommended regular exercise and lifestyle changes according to EULAR recommendation guide for CVD risk management. One possible intervention that could be used to decrease CVD risk caused by both diseases is cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program in which regular exercise is one of the main components. But RA patients, especially those with cardiovascular comorbidities, are rarely referred to the CR program.

This study will help to clarify the effects of the CR program added to the pharmacological treatment of these patients on cardiovascular mortality risk (Framingham risk score and QRISK-3 score), blood pressure (24-Hour holter monitoring), disease activity (DAS28-CRP), aerobic capacity (VO2max), quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey) and psychological state (Beck depression inventory).",RECRUITING,,2022-12-15,2024-06-15,2024-04-15,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,40,ESTIMATED

NCT00005748,Stress Reduction and Prevention of Hypertension in Blacks,,To examine the role of Transcendental Meditation in stress reduction and prevention of hypertension in Blacks.,"BACKGROUND:

African Americans suffer from disproportionate rates of hypertension and related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due, at least in part, to excessive socioenvironmental and psychosocial stress. Furthermore, despite the substantial individual and population risk burden associated with high normal blood pressure (BP) in African Americans, there had been no controlled studies to evaluate stress reduction approaches in the primary prevention of hypertension targeted to this high risk group. Therefore, recent (mid 1990s) NIH and NIMH policy committees called for a new research focus on primary prevention of hypertension targeted to high risk populations-notably African Americans with high normal BP. In previous randomized controlled trials by the investigator, hypertension and psychosocial stress were significantly reduced in low SES African Americans who practiced stress reduction with the Transcendental Mediation (TM) program compared to relaxation or health education controls. In the most recent long-term trial, African Americans with borderline hypertension showed BP reductions that would be associated with a 17 percent decrease in prevalence of hypertension, a 15 percent reduction in stroke, and a 6 percent reduction in CHD in the population. These BP reductions compared favorably to decreases shown with sodium restriction and weight loss programs in other prevention trials. Also, pilot data from two clinical trials indicated that TM was associated with significantly lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in African Americans and in Caucasians with high BP over a 5-year and 15-year period, respectively.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A randomized controlled trial of stress reduction for the primary prevention of hypertension was conducted in African Americans with high normal BP. African American males and females (N-352, aged 21-75 years) with high normal BP (SBP 130-139 and/or DBP 85-89 mm Hg) were recruited from the African American Family Heart Health Plan at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, which housed the nation's largest registry of African Americans with known CVD risk factors. After baseline assessment, participants were randomized to either the TM program or to a matched health education control intervention. The primary outcome was change in clinic BP over a 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes in ambulatory BP, hypertensive events, psychosocial stress and health behaviors. Also, a model of the pathways through which components of stressful experience affect high BP in African Americans was tested.

This study is described as a clinical trial. The summary statement states that it is not an NIH Phase III clinical trial.

Vision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. The modern goals of glaucoma management are to avoid glaucomatous damage, nerve damage, preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients with minimal side effects.

Although intraocular pressure is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. Intraocular pressure can be lowered with medication, usually eye drops. There are several different classes of medications to treat glaucoma with several different medications in each class. In order to prevent blindness from glaucoma, it is critical that patients take their glaucoma eye drops accurately and faithfully for the rest of their lives. Poor compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for vision loss in glaucoma patients. In addition, coordination involved in placing an eye drop in the eye is considerably more difficult and unpleasant to patients than many other therapies.

The study also aims to test this training course among non-physician graders in Vietnam,"Background:

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of diabetes will increase by 51% from 463 million in 2019 to 743 million in 2045 among adults between the ages of 20-79 years. This increase is projected to be 15% in Europe, 33% in North America, 74% in South East Asia and 143% in Africa from 2019 to 2045. About 3 in 5 participants who have diabetes in Africa remain undiagnosed. Whereas the total diabetes related health expenditure is 494 billion USD in high income countries, and 264 billion USD in middle income countries, low income countries expend only 1 billion USD. Therefore, diabetes is a huge problem worldwide especially in low income countries.

Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes which leads to blindness if left untreated. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness especially among the working group when vision is very important for daily living. Diabetic retinopathy is identified in a third of diabetic patients.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) however can be treated effectively but early detection and timely referrals are essential for successful outcomes. Early diagnosis, timely referrals and access to treatment through a comprehensive and systematic surveillance of the diabetic population has been shown to be clinically effective and cost effective. The United Kingdom (UK) has a national population based diabetic retinopathy screening programme which has been very successful. These screening programmes are non-existent or inadequately developed in many resource constrained settings. A study was recently concluded in Vietnam in which non-physician graders were trained to screen for diabetic retinopathy among the population of diabetic patients. The study also assessed the accuracy of DR grading among medical graders versus non-physician graders in Vietnam.

The aim of this current study is to develop and test a low cost opportunistic glaucoma screening model during diabetic retinopathy screening using the same non physician graders currently used in the recently concluded diabetic retinopathy (DR) study.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic optic nerve changes and functional visual field defects which in part is related to a raised intraocular pressure (IOP). The disease is characterized by typical pattern of damage to the optic nerve, loss of retinal ganglion cells, and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Glaucoma can be divided into two main types based on the morphology of the anterior chamber angle: there is the open angle and the angle closure glaucoma. These two types of glaucoma have different risk factors, different natural histories and different management. There are other forms of classification which include primary and secondary glaucomas depending on the etiology of the glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. An estimated 60.5 million persons were said to be affected by glaucoma in 2010. Glaucoma is a huge problem worldwide especially in developing countries. The disease however can be managed with medical, laser, and surgical forms of treatment. Reduction of intraocular pressure by 30-50% from baseline usually stops progression of the disease.

It has been reported that the increasing life expectancy especially of Asians and Africans may lead to an increase in the prevalence of glaucoma by 74% from 2013 to 2040. It is projected that the prevalence of glaucoma will increase from 64.3 million to 111.8 million in 2040, and that glaucoma will disproportionately affect people residing in Africa and Asia.

Glaucoma often progresses unnoticed by the patient until central visual acuity is affected, therefore early detection of the disease is important before symptoms develop. The rate of undiagnosed disease however is quite high in developing countries with a large proportion not being aware of the disease. It is estimated that about 95% are not aware of their glaucoma in developing countries while 50% are unaware of the disease in developed countries. Early detection of glaucoma requires some form of screening. Screening of any disease is a form of secondary prevention and the goal is often to prevent undesired outcomes. In the context of glaucoma, screening helps to diagnose it in the asymptomatic stage so that treatment can be started earlier to slow down or prevent progression of the disease to blindness. In a recent study on the burden of undetected untreated glaucoma in the United States, it was reported that the odds of having undiagnosed glaucoma was highest among blacks with a 4.4 times greater odds compared with Caucasians. This disparity was attributed to uneven access to health care by blacks. One way to alleviate this is to conduct population based screening for glaucoma. But this has not been found to be cost effective in developed countries.

In a very recent study published in the Lancet Global Health, however, population screening was reported to be cost effective in China. In a study on the cost effectiveness of community screening for glaucoma in rural India, it was reported that community screening would prevent 2,190 person years blindness over a 10 year period. It was concluded that community population screening may be cost effective if targeted at 40-69 years' age group and if implemented in urban areas. A study in China recently demonstrated using a decision analytic Markov model that population screening for both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) was cost effective in both rural and urban China.

It is possible that screening of two major blinding eye diseases (glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy) using the same facilities is likely to be more cost effective. Opportunistic glaucoma screening can be more cost effective especially when it is piggy bagged into another screening programme. Diabetic retinopathy screening has been ongoing with the use of optic nerve photos. It is possible to train the same non- physician graders who are currently screening for diabetic retinopathy to also screen for glaucoma using the same facilities and images.

The use of non-physician graders to conduct screening in low-resource settings is particularly important as these are the group of health workers who have been trained to screen for diabetes. In addition, it reduces the burden on scarce, highly-trained health care providers in developing countries.

Study Aims:

* To develop a training course for screening glaucoma using fundus images obtained during diabetic retinopathy screening by non-physician graders.
* To test this training course among non-physician graders in Vietnam

Main research question Can trained non-physician graders accurately screen for glaucoma during diabetic retinopathy screening?

Methods

Study design: This is an uncontrolled interventional experimental before and after study in which a minimum of 42 non-physician graders shall be trained to screen for glaucoma using optic nerve photos obtained for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in Vietnam.

The study flow will be as follows:

* Non-physician graders are consented, enrolled and undergo testing on the standard image set at baseline
* The non-physician graders complete the training course. There are questions at the end of each module of the course and participants must pass the revision questions. Those failing to pass any aspects of the revision questions must review those parts of the course.
* Non-physician graders will undergo a post course test on the standard image set.

Their performance will be compared to baseline and also to that of ophthalmologists who are taking part in the DR grading programme, but who have not taken the optic nerve grading course

• Non-physician graders will undergo a post course test on the standard image set.

Their performance will be compared to baseline and also to that of ophthalmologists who are taking part in the DR grading programme, but who have not taken the optic nerve grading course

Standard Image training set and Test Set:

These will each consist of about 50 normal optic nerve images of people without glaucoma and about 50 images of people with glaucoma, obtained from the on-going ORBIS CAFÉ DR screening programme (in which the graders are working), population-based eye studies in the UK (NICOLA) and the standard Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy Evaluation (GONE) set of images. (https://gone-project.com/newgone/)

Training and evaluating competencies:

Training shall be done online, using the Cyber-sight website of Orbis, The course has been created specifically for the study by the investigators, modified from materials used to teach physicians on the World Glaucoma Association and GONE websites and training courses for ophthalmology residents. A minimum threshold of 70% accuracy on a previously-designed test set will be considered as adequate competency. Participants who score less than 70% on the test will have a teacher led training course after which the participants will repeat the test again.

Recruitment:

Vietnam non-physician and ophthalmologist DR image graders: These persons are already trained to screen and grade diabetic retinopathy and will be recruited by asking them about their willingness to take part in the study. Informed consent will be obtained, and participants will be allowed to participate voluntarily .and if they told that if they choose not to participate in the study, their jobs will not be affected in anyway. A minimum of 42 non-physician and 12 ophthalmologist graders shall be included in the study

Planned statistical analysis of results:

Statistical Sample Size \& Methods: The minimum sample size of 42 participants was calculated using the paired sample size formula for quantitative outcome data with confidence level of 95% and statistical power of 80%. Using the statistics from the Glaucoma Optic Neuropathy Evaluation study (GONE), we assumed that the mean baseline score would be the same as the 5th percentile score on the GONE evaluation course which is 29%.

At the end of the course, we assumed that the mean score would be the same as the 45th -50th percentile score on the GONE evaluation course which is 60%. Briefly the GONE online course was designed to evaluate participant's skills in evaluating the optic nerve head for glaucoma. It was started in 2015 and as of October 2021, there had been 45,619 attempts by 11,287 individuals. However, when only first attempts and those who had completed at least 80% of the course were considered, this number reduced to 3666 participants. This course consists of 15 disc images in all.

Sensitivity and specificity (with 95% confidence Intervals (CI's)), positive and negative predictive values, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa statistic comparing non-physician and ophthalmologist graders in Vietnam with the grades on the standard image sets shall be performed. The performance of non-physician graders after training will be compared to that before training, and also to that of ophthalmologists who have not taken the optic nerve course but are working as DR graders in the CAFÉ programme, with the main outcome for comparison being the area under the receiver-operator curve.

Data Protection issues Participants from whom optic nerve images were obtained shall not be formally enrolled into this study. Only their de-identified optic nerve images will be used in this study and analysis of images shall be done in a de-identified fashion. Although optic nerve images are considered personal data, all images are fully anonymized and de-identified. Blanket permission for research use of images was obtained in the NICOLA, HANDAN and the GONE studies. These studies have full ethical approvals and obtained consent from participants to use the images in future studies.

All electronic copies of data shall be stored on password-protected computers with written log books and password protected access to buildings. All paper copies of data will be locked in a specific filing cabinets in QUB. All optic nerve photos will be anonymized, completely de-identified and kept in a safe, password-protected server at QUB. All data produced from this study shall be completely anonymized.",COMPLETED,,2021-11-22,2022-04-30,2022-03-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,SCREENING,42,ACTUAL
NCT06739057,Pediatric Ventricle Function Assessment Study,Pediatric Ventricle Function Assessment Study,"This study aims to develop a deep learning-based framework for right ventricular (RV) segmentation, prediction of RV fractional area change (FAC), and identification of pediatric RV dysfunction. The AI model was designed to distinguish between normal pediatric hearts, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). To improve diagnostic accuracy, the investigators extended the analysis beyond the A4C view by integrating data from both A4C and PSAX views. Additionally, the framework was applied to predict left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF), further showcasing its versatility and clinical utility.","Heart defects are a leading cause of birth defect-associated illness and mortality worldwide, affecting approximately 1% of live births globally. Among these, about one-quarter1 present with critical heart defects requiring early intervention to improve survival and outcomes.Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a prevalent form of heart disease in pediatric patients, often arising from conditions such as prematurity, post-surgical effects of congenital heart disease, functioning as the systemic ventricle, and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. These patients face significant risks, including RV failure, decreased quality of life, potential need for transplantation, and increased mortality. Accurate assessment of RV function is crucial but challenging due to the RV's complex geometry.

Unlike left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, RV dysfunction primarily results from pressure and volume overloads and has unique pathophysiological characteristics. While LV dysfunction mechanisms are well-studied, less is known about RV, and much of its clinical management is adapted from LV-focused research. The RV, with its thinner and more adaptable walls, remodels efficiently but often tolerate changes for extended periods before failure. Furthermore, RV dysfunction frequently leads to LV dysfunction due to strong interventricular interactions. These differences, along with the RV's irregular shape and orientation, complicate imaging and assessment, requiring advanced imaging techniques, often involving multiple modalities.

Precise evaluation of RV size and function is essential for diagnosing, managing, and predicting outcomes in pediatric cardiac conditions. Echocardiography, as a non-invasive and accessible tool, is the first-line imaging technique for monitoring RV function). However, traditional RV functional measures face limitations in pediatric populations due to significant variability in RV morphology. Among systolic parameters, fractional area change (FAC) has demonstrated stronger correlations with disease severity in advanced heart failure patients and a closer relationship with RV ejection fraction as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), suggesting its reliability in assessing pediatric RV function. An FAC \<35% is considered abnormal by the guideline. Accurate FAC assessment can guide timely interventions, improve prognosis, and enhance long-term outcomes by enabling better monitoring of RV function over time.

Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) includes a wide range of structural abnormalities and conditions that affect the heart's development before birth, with examples such as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and Pulmonary hypertension(PH). The RV plays a crucial role in TOF diagnosis because its outflow tract obstruction and hypertrophy are primary features of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension increases the afterload (pressure) on the right ventricle, leading to RV structural and functional changes. These changes are typically not seen in the LV unless there is severe biventricular involvement or secondary effects.

Echocardiography is a non-invasive, widely accessible, and essential first-line tool for routine follow-up of various pediatric cardiac conditions affecting the right ventricle (RV). However, assessing RV function in pediatric heart disease remains challenging due to significant variability in RV morphology and physiology. The apical four-chamber (A4C) view is a cornerstone for right ventricular (RV) function assessment due to its ability to evaluate RV size, shape, and systolic function comprehensively. The parasternal short-axis (PSAX) view is often used as a supplementary echocardiographic view alongside the A4C view for assessing right ventricular (RV) function. Advances in AI-driven echocardiography, particularly deep learning, hold promise for enhancing cardiac function assessment. Recent innovations, like EchoNet-Dynamic, have shown the utility of video-based deep learning algorithms for adult LV segmentation and ejection fraction estimation. Building on this progress, the investigators developed EchoNet-Peds , an AI model for pediatric echocardiography that automates LV segmentation and ejection fraction calculations. Beside left ventricle segmentation methods, other deep learning applications include automated quantification of left ventricular structure and function, as well as novel methods for estimating intraventricular hemodynamic parameters on a beat-to-beat basis . However, most deep learning studies focus on LV assessment, with comparatively fewer models dedicated to the RV, mainly addressing segmentation tasks. While some recent advancements have emerged, such as a model estimating RV ejection fraction from echocardiographic images in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients , significant gaps remain in applying AI to pediatric RV functional assessment.

This study aims to develop a deep learning-based framework for right ventricular (RV) segmentation, prediction of RV fractional area change (FAC), and identification of pediatric RV dysfunction. The AI model was designed to distinguish between normal pediatric hearts, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).

All participants will be provided with a ""smart bottle"" to house their glaucoma medications. The smart bottle records the date and time that the bottle is opened. For participants in the intervention arm only, a reminder function will be activated. The proportion or prescribed doses taken according to the monitor will be compared for the two groups.","The purpose if this study is to improve glaucoma medication adherence in Veterans with medically-treated glaucoma. The study design is a single-site randomized controlled trial. Specific Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of an intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among Veterans at 6-month follow up.

Hypothesis 1: Veterans randomized to the intervention will have a greater proportion of prescribed glaucoma medication doses taken as measured by the electronic medication monitor in the 6 months following the intervention compared to Veterans randomized to the control arm.

The primary outcome for hypothesis 1A is the proportion of prescribed doses taken according to the electronic monitor. Participants in both arms will receive the electronic monitor or ""smart bottle,"" which wirelessly transmits the date and time of opening of the smart bottle to the study team. From these medication events, the proportion of prescribed doses will be derived, defined as the ratio of the number of times the smart bottle was opened to the required number of doses prescribed according to the medical record over the period of time that the bottle is in use. For example, if a participant is advised to take his or her glaucoma drop twice a day for the 180 days that the bottle is in use and the smart bottle reveals 135 openings over the same time period, the proportion of prescribed doses taken is 37.5%.

Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of the intervention on intensification of glaucoma therapy among Veterans at 12-month follow-up.

Hypothesis 2: The proportion of Veterans in the intervention arm that are prescribed more intensive glaucoma therapy, defined as addition of adjuvant glaucoma medication or recommendation for laser or glaucoma surgery will be less than the proportion of Veterans in the control arm who are prescribed more intensive glaucoma therapy in the 12 months following the intervention.

Baseline data collection will include cataloging the current glaucoma medication regimen prescribed to the participant. Chart abstractions will be performed at 12 months following the baseline visit and intensification of glaucoma therapy will be defined as either 1) the addition of another glaucoma medication to the baseline regimen, 2) recommendation for glaucoma laser treatment, or 3) recommendation for glaucoma surgery in the 12 months following the baseline visit . The investigators will collect these data at 12 months because the Metrics study suggested that 55% of participants in the control arm will have intensification of therapy within one year.

Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness and budget and workflow impacts of the intervention compared to usual care.

Hypothesis 3: The intervention will be cost-effectiveness for the following ratios: 1) cost per percentage improvement in medication adherence; 2) cost per blindness averted; and 3) cost per quality-adjusted-life years saved.

A direct measurement approach will be used to estimate per-patient intervention and control arm costs. Glaucoma-related health care utilization costs will be derived from VA administrative datasets. The cost estimates will be combined with observed improvement in medication adherence and reduction in escalation in therapy to estimate the first two incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Simulation using Markov modeling will be used to estimate the incremental cost per blindness averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Cost estimates and labor time data collected will be combined with glaucoma prevalence rates among Veterans to estimate overall budget and workload impacts to the VA healthcare system.",COMPLETED,,2017-08-09,2021-03-01,2019-08-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,200,ACTUAL

This by obtaining a blood sample from the PAH patients undergoing right heart cathetrization as well as obtaining the endothelial cells from the balloon tipped catheters and extracting the EBV virus to detect its presence.

IgG, IgM and PCR for EBV tests will be done.","About Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pathophysiological disorder that may involve multiple clinical conditions combined with a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of more than 20 mmHg at rest (Humbert, M.et al., 2022).

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition characterized by vascular proliferation, leading to increased vascular resistance and right heart dysfunction. PAH may be idiopathic (Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension IPAH; previously known as primary pulmonary hypertension, PPH) or associated with other conditions or exposures, including connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, portal hypertension, and anorexigenic drug ingestion (Humbert, M.et al., 2022).

About Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus Chronic Active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is usually defined as a chronic illness lasting at least 6 months, an increased EBV level in either the tissue or the blood, and lack of evidence of a known underlying immunodeficiency. It may be associated with Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, and extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (Kimura et al., 2017).

CAEBV is characterized by an unusual pattern of anti-EBV antibodies and may be associated with cardiovascular abnormalities (Hashimoto et al., 2011).

Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is based on clinical symptoms and serological markers, including the following: immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA), heterophile antibodies, and IgG antibodies to the EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1)(Klutts JS. Et al., 2009).

Elevated levels of EBV DNA in the blood are more specific for CAEBV than elevated levels of EBV antibodies (Kimura H. et al., 2017).

Role of EBV in PAH The relationships between EBV and autoimmune diseases are complex and involve several mechanisms. A proposed scenario was the interrelation between genetic predisposition and EBV infection, a cross-reaction between self antigens and EBV viral proteins, the development of autoantibodies (anti-Sm or anti-Ro antibodies in SLE, anti-CCP antibodies in RA), an epitope-spreading process that can lead to the development of additional non-cross-reactive autoepitopes, and finally the clinical manifestations (Poole BD et al.,2006).

EBV has multiple impacts on host immunity and can adapt to its environment. For instance, EBV produces an IL-10-like cytokine, it can modulate IL-6 release, it induces the production of TNF-a by infected B cells, and it can inhibit apoptosis of infected B cells by the production of a Bcl-2 homolog. All these biological properties of EBV are relevant to, and can contribute to, the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders (Toussirot É et al.,2008).

The pathophysiology of the development of PAH in CAEBV is unclear. It may be related to lymphocytic infiltration and the resultant damage to the pulmonary vascular endothelium caused by EBV infection or may occur secondary to the vascular damage caused by inflammatory reactions induced by EBV infection (Gotoh K. et al., 2008).

Another is EBV-induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines resulting in inflammatory change (Fujiwara M. et al., 2003).",COMPLETED,,2023-05-01,2024-04-01,2024-03-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,78,ACTUAL
NCT00580957,The Autonomic Nervous System and the Metabolic Syndrome,The Autonomic Nervous System and the Metabolic Syndrome,"The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the role of the autonomic nervous system in the insulin resistant state associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity results from an accumulation of excessive fat deposit due to increase caloric intake or decrease energy expenditure, this condition is usually associated with diseases such as hypertension or diabetes, a cluster known as the metabolic syndrome. The first step in the development of the metabolic syndrome is a resistance to the action of insulin. The mechanism underlying insulin resistance in obesity is still unknown, however some investigators have proposed that the autonomic nervous system, particularly the increase sympathetic activation in obesity may play an important role. We have extensive experience studying the role of the autonomic nervous system in the cardiovascular alterations associated with obesity by producing complete autonomic withdrawal with a drug named trimethaphan. We propose to use the same approach to study the role of the autonomic nervous system in the development of insulin resistance in obesity.","The purpose of this study is to look at the role of the autonomic nervous system, an involuntary nervous system that controls your blood pressure, in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin is a substance that helps your body use the sugar in the food that you eat. Some people's tissues stop reacting in a normal way to insulin, a condition known as insulin resistance. A person with insulin resistance can have other health problems, such as obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. These problems together are called the metabolic syndrome. We think that the autonomic or involuntary nervous system controls the way your body responds to insulin. This system is changed in obese people, and we think that it may cause the insulin resistance. We plan to study this with two drugs -trimethaphan and L-NMMA. Neither of these drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they will be used for research purposes only.

NCT04958057,Social Risks-Focused Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Preeclampsia (SAIL),Social Risks-Focused Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Preeclampsia in AA Women,"Preeclampsia is a disease of pregnancy and first few weeks after birth. It is diagnosed as new onset of high blood pressure and injury to organs such as kidneys, liver, and brain. Preeclampsia is growing at a rapid rate - rate that exceeds diabetes and heart disease. Over half a million lives lost each year to preeclampsia. Women with a history of preeclampsia have 3-4 times the risk of high blood pressure. They also have double the risk for heart disease and stroke. Racial and ethnic disparities are present in preeclampsia. Black women are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia. They are also at much higher risk of dying from preeclampsia than other women. The reasons behind such disparities are unclear. What may explain these differences are social determinants of health. The contribution of social determinants to differences in preeclampsia is well recognized. However, a major gap in research remains strategies that address these factors. Our study will test a lifestyle intervention incorporating social risk factors to reduce the risk of preeclampsia.","Preeclampsia is a significant global health problem affecting over 10 million pregnancies each year. Preeclampsia disproportionately burdens ethnic minority women, especially African American women when compared to non-Hispanic white women. Once diagnosed with preeclampsia, African women are 3 times more likely to die of preeclampsia compared to their white counterparts. Evidence supports contribution of social risk factors towards racial and ethnic disparities seen with preeclampsia. However, currently, there are few trials that examine efficacy of social risks-focused lifestyle interventions on reduction of preeclampsia and its complications. This proposal is designed to address this crucial gap by testing feasibility (Aim 1), acceptability (Aim 1) and efficacy (Aim 2) of a social risks-focused lifestyle intervention to reduce preeclampsia in pregnant inner-city African American women. The intervention will be delivered via a randomized control trial design (N=100), with 6 monthly group sessions conducted in the second and third trimesters. The overall hypothesis is that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable, and that women randomized to the intervention group will have lower blood pressure and lower rates of preeclampsia compared with women receiving routine prenatal care.",RECRUITING,,2022-03-28,2024-12-31,2024-11-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,100,ESTIMATED

NCT06726057,Implementing a Multi-component Hypertension Control Strategy in Rural Pakistan,A Multi-component Intervention for Controlling Hypertension in the Adult Rural Population of Pakistan: a Protocol for a Hybrid Type III Implementation-effectiveness Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"This is a research about cardiovascular disease risk reduction: a comprehensive package for the reduction of risk in Sindh, Pakistan. The research is being conducted by the Aga Khan University and is funded by the National Institute of Health and Care Research UK.

Hypertension is a major public health concern globally. It is a significant risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature death. In Pakistan, the prevalence of hypertension, including those on medication, is high. However, there are also high rates of undertreatment and underdiagnosis of hypertension in Pakistan. Addressing the prevention and control of CVD requires a multi-faceted approach that targets diverse populations across different settings. In some populations, we have interventions that have been proven effective but have not been implemented for example in rural communities. In Pakistan, prior community-based trial regarding multi-component hypertension intervention has proven to be effective in reducing blood pressure. However, the findings of this work have not translated to change in practice on the ground suggesting the need for implementation research to examine the best ways to implement this intervention in the real world. Hence, in this study researchers aim to assess the impact of this evidence-based intervention when implemented at scale in rural communities.

Participants will be asked to participate in a research study designed to improve their blood pressure control. This study enrols participants aged 35 years and above. As part of this study, they will undergo:

* blood pressure measurements at regular intervals by lady health workers
* home health education sessions conducted by lady health workers
* participants may be referred to a nearby health facility/qualified medical practitioners for management of high blood pressure
* baseline survey at the start of the study having questions about participants' medical history, risk factors for cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure and bodily measurements including weight, height and waist circumference
* follow-up surveys every 6 months for 2 years. The survey questions will comprise of medical history, risk factors for cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure; and bodily measurements including weight, height and waist circumference
* blood and urine samples for testing at baseline survey and during endline survey

POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORT

There are no risks involved as a result of participants' participation in this study except for their time. Since they will be followed up for 2 years, any new information developed during the study that may affect their willingness to continue participation will be communicated to them. Participants may feel a little discomfort at the site of the needle prick when drawing a blood sample.

POSSIBLE BENEFITS

Participants will be able to know about their risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. They'll be referred to a qualified medical practitioner for the management of your high blood pressure. Also, the results of their blood and urine tests will be shared with participants that will help them know about their health.

The Blood Pressure Lowering Strategies to Eliminate Hypertension Disparities (BLESSED) cluster randomized trial aims to test the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of a community health worker (CHW)-led multifaceted intervention compared to enhanced usual care for hypertension control in Black communities. In the BLESSED trial, the investigators plan to recruit 1,176 adults with hypertension (approximately 28 per church) from 42 predominantly Black churches in the Greater New Orleans area. The multifaceted intervention will last for 18 months, followed by a post-intervention follow-up visit at 24 months. The BLESSED trial aims to generate evidence regarding the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of this CHW-led church-based multifaceted intervention in eliminating hypertension disparities in the United States (US) general population.","Louisiana residents, especially African Americans, bear a disproportionately high burden of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the Blood Pressure Lowering Strategies to Eliminate Hypertension Disparities (BLESSED) cluster randomized trial, the investigators will compare the impact of two implementation strategies - a CHW-led multifaceted strategy and a group-based education strategy - for delivering interventions recommended by the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension clinical guidelines on implementation and clinical effectiveness outcomes in predominantly Black community members over 18 months. The BLESSED study utilizes an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to: (1). test the effectiveness of a CHW-led church-based multifaceted implementation strategy for reducing estimated CVD risk over 18 months among African American church community members at high risk for CVD, and (2). assess the implementation outcomes (acceptability, adaptation, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetrance, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability) simultaneously. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework has guided the development and evaluation of the multifaceted implementation strategy, which includes CHW-led health coaching on lifestyle changes and medication adherence; healthcare delivery in community; church-based exercise and weight loss programs; self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP); and provider education and engagement. The CHW-led church-based intervention will provide strong social support and tackle multiple social determinants of CVD disparities. The primary clinical effectiveness outcome is the difference in mean change of systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 18 months between intervention and control groups.

NCT02822222,Safety Study of RMJH-111b to Treat Essential Hypertension,"A Phase 1/2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of RMJH-111b in Adult Subjects With Essential Hypertension","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of RMJH-111b, including how well it is tolerated, and the effect of RMJH-111b on blood pressure in subjects with hypertension. The study also measured the amount of magnesium in the blood and urine before and after RMJH-111b administration to evaluate what the body does to RMJH-111b (pharmacokinetics).","This was a phase 1/2, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and tolerability of RMJH-111b in adult subjects with essential hypertension. Assessments of pharmacokinetics and efficacy were secondary objectives.

RMJ Holdings LLC (doing business as RMJH Rx) is developing RMJH-111b (magnesium citrate, tribasic anhydrous) soft gelatin capsules for the treatment of essential hypertension. The rationale for developing RMJH-111b for essential hypertension is based on reported calcium channel blocker and vasodilator effects of magnesium cation (Mg++). Given this hypothesized mechanism of action, RMJH-111b may not be effective for subjects with other causes or forms of hypertension, and thus the diagnosis of essential hypertension was a key inclusion criterion for this trial.

In order to avoid confounding the results of the trial, subjects who were already taking anti-hypertensive medications to manage their hypertension were taken off of those medications and underwent a 7-day washout period. Subjects that met the specified blood pressure criteria after the washout \[systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 150 and ≤ 200 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 95 and ≤ 115 mmHg\] received placebo orally twice a day (bid) for a 3-day run-in period (Days 1-3). Subjects that were recently diagnosed or previously diagnosed and off treatment for \> 1 week before starting the study and who met the blood pressure criteria proceeded directly to the 3-day run-in period (i.e., without the 7-day washout period). During the 3-day run-in period, the subjects remained in the clinical research unit (CRU) on a low salt (2.5 g/24 hours) diet.

Subjects that remained eligible after the run-in period were randomized to receive either 440 mg of RMJH-111b or placebo orally bid (i.e., total daily dose of 880 and 0 mg elemental magnesium, respectively) for a 7-day treatment period (Days 4-10). A total of 21 subjects randomized 15:6 to RMJH-111b or placebo was planned. Subjects were randomized on either June 10th or 23rd of 2016. Based on the screen failure rate of the 1st cohort, the number of subjects needed for the 2nd cohort was projected. The actual number of subjects eligible for randomization at the end of the run-in period in the 2nd cohort exceeded the projection by 1 and all eligible subjects were randomized. Thus, the actual number of subjects randomized was 22, with 16 subjects in the RMJH-111b group and 6 subjects in the placebo group (i.e., 16:6 rather than 15:6). Subjects remained in the CRU on a low salt (2.5 g/24 hours) diet for the entire 7-day treatment period and through the 24-hour post treatment assessments (Day 11).

Subjects returned to the clinic 8 days (±3 days) after the last dose of Study Drug (active or placebo) for their Final Study Visit.

Protocol-specified reasons for discontinuing a subject from the study included, but were not limited to: 1) subject's blood pressure was too elevated for them to safely continue in the study (subjects who experienced SBP \>200 mmHg or DBP \>115 mmHg had to have these measurements repeated approximately 1 hour later, and if the SBP or DBP remained elevated, the subject was to be removed from the study and treated accordingly), 2) subject experienced a sharp drop in blood pressure (SBP \< 110 mmHg or DBP \< 60 mmHg); 3) subject's patellar reflex (knee jerk) disappeared, and 4) subject's total serum magnesium levels increased to ≥ 5 mg/dL (twice the upper limit of normal). As a conservative measure for this first trial of RMJH-111b, the criterion regarding drop in blood pressure did not require any associated clinical symptoms. For the pivotal trial, RMJH Rx will incorporate orthostatic hypotension monitoring and refine the discontinuation criterion regarding drop in blood pressure to allow for continued Study Drug treatment in the absence of clinical symptoms, so as to avoid unnecessarily removing a subject that is experiencing therapeutic benefit.

All measurements used for the safety assessments in this study are widely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. Further, they included standard parameters used in the evaluation of drugs with the potential for anti-hypertensive and magnesium toxicity effects.

Because blood pressure varies at daytime compared to nighttime, mean daytime (8 AM to 4 PM), nighttime (10 PM to 6 AM), and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) parameters were used to assess the efficacy effects of RMJH-111b on blood pressure in this trial. While 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is considered as a more precise method for the evaluation of drug effects on blood pressure than clinic visit (seated) blood pressures, this trial also included efficacy evaluations of seated SBP and DBP parameters for informational purposes and in particular to facilitate the design of the larger pivotal trial where ABPM monitoring will not be practical.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of magnesium is complicated by pre-existing endogenous levels of magnesium, other ingested sources of magnesium (daily diet and supplements; supplements with total daily dose of magnesium ≤ 150 mg were allowed in this study), and the tight regulation of magnesium in the body (magnesium homeostasis) with relatively high levels of magnesium in bones and soft tissues compared to approximately 1% in the blood. Thus, the total serum magnesium exposure was anticipated to be minimally effected with RMJH-111b intake, but evidence of urinary magnesium excretion coupled with maintained total serum magnesium exposure was expected to provide an indication of intake rather than magnesium wasting.",COMPLETED,,2016-06-10,2016-07-07,2016-07-07,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,22,ACTUAL

NCT00001622,Study of the Response of Human Small Blood Vessels,Study of the Relation Between In Vivo and In Vitro Response of Human Small Vessels,"A layer of cells called the endothelium line the walls of blood vessels. These cells produce substances that control the tone of blood vessels and thus control blood flow through the vessel. One of the substances produced involved in the control of blood vessel function is nitric oxide. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the relaxation of blood vessels.

Researchers have been interested in the function of the endothelium in patients with high blood pressure (essential hypertension) and patients with high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia).

After conducting studies on the endothelium and nitric oxide, researchers have found that the endothelium is indeed functioning abnormally in patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In addition, researchers have determined that the dysfunction is a result of abnormalities in the nitric oxide (NO) system.

In this study researchers plan to investigate the relationship between blood vessel responses in real-life settings versus laboratory settings in normal volunteers, patients with high blood pressure, and patients with high cholesterol.","Over the last ten years, we have been interested in the investigation of endothelial function in patients with essential hypertension and patients with hypercholesterolemia. We have performed intra-arterial infusion of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent drugs into the brachial artery with noninvasive measurement of the response of the forearm vasculature by means of strain gauge plethysmography. Those studies have allowed us to: a) demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with hypercholesterolemia; and b) identify an abnormality in the endothelium-derived nitric oxide system that is responsible for endothelial dysfunction in these patients. Further studies to more precisely determine the intracellular processes that mediate this abnormality in endothelial function in these patients are limited by the inherent shortcomings of the in vivo technique. An alternative possibility is the study of human small vessels in vitro; however, the relationship between in vivo and in vitro vascular responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent agonists has not been established. In the present study, we propose to investigate this relationship in normal volunteers, patients with essential hypertension, and patients with hypercholesterolemia.",COMPLETED,,1997-03,2001-03,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,,,,TREATMENT,87,

NCT03258125,miRNA-452 in Patients With Preeclampsia and Its Correlation With MMP-9,Expression of miRNA-452 in Patients With Early Onset Preeclampsia and Its Correlation With MMP-9,Preeclampsia is a pregnancy related disease characterized by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women. PE is one of the most challenging diseases in obstetrics worldwide that affects 2-8 % of pregnancies causing both morbidity and mortality of both mother and fetus.,"The etiology and pathophysiology of preeclampsia are still unclear but the impaired invasive ability of the trophoblast cells of the placenta and vascular endothelial cell damage are the main two factors. The invasiveness of trophoblast cells depends on the production of proteases, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs are a family of 24 zinc dependent endopeptidases capable of degrading extra cellular matrix components. MMP-9 plays an important role in placental invasion and implantation.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small (19-24 nucleotides in length), single-stranded, non-protein-coding RNAs, which suppress translation or promote the degradation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thus play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and even development of cancer.

The role of miRNA in preeclampsia pathogenesis has been investigated in a number of studies. One of the target areas of the miRNAs that forms a link with preeclampsia pathogenesis is the dysregulation of trophoblast differentiation, proliferation, and invasion; this occurs during early pregnancy and leads to the development of preeclampsia; a range of miRNAs have been confirmed to play pivotal roles in these processes by targeting a number of different genes.

MiR-452 is a newly discovered cancer related type of miRNA that was shown to be involved in invasion process where it was upregulated in certain types of cancer such as blad¬der cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma and was found to be significantly decreased in other types of cancer such as non-small cell lung cancer , glioma, prostate cancer and Gastric cell cancer.

Based on these previous studies which demonstrate the effect of miR-452 in invasion process of cancer cells either by stimulation or inhibition and that preeclampsia is a disease of impaired placental invasion in which MMP-9 play an important role, we will investigate the placental tissues expression changes of miR-452 which is not studied yet in early onset preeclampsia patients compared to control and try to find a possible mechanism by which it act on placental invasion by measuring expression level of MMP-9 and making correlation between them. The results of this study will provide experimental and theo¬retical basis for clinical prediction, prevention and treatment of preeclampsia.",COMPLETED,,2019-01-01,2020-06-01,2020-04-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,50,ACTUAL

In this rospective comparative study, we are aimed to evaluate the correlation between EUS-PPG measured in supine position (EUS-suPPG), and EUS-PPG measured in left lateral decubitus position (EUS-lePPG).","The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) remains the gold standard for assessing portal hypertension, yet its clinical application faces several limitations. First, HVPG has restricted diagnostic scope, being unable to accurately evaluate prehepatic or presinusoidal portal hypertension. Second, the measurement process exposes both patients and physicians to radiation and involves complex techniques that preclude routine implementation in many hospitals. Finally, as HVPG indirectly estimates portal pressure through wedged hepatic venous pressure, its accuracy may be compromised by multiple factors including intrahepatic venous shunting, catheter insertion depth, excessive sedation or patient agitation during the procedure, and incomplete balloon occlusion of hepatic venous flow.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided portal pressure gradient (EUS-PPG) measurement effectively addresses these limitations of HVPG. Current clinical studies on EUS-PPG have predominantly been conducted in the supine position. However, this position significantly increases the technical difficulty of endoscopic ultrasonography and complicates the simultaneous performance of endoscopic selective varices devascularization (EUS-ESVD) under single anesthesia. The consistency of EUS-PPG measurements between left lateral decubitus and supine positions requires further investigation.

This prospective comparative study enrolls hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by esophagogastric varices. Prior to endoscopic treatment, we perform EUS-guided puncture of both the portal vein and hepatic vein using a 25G needle. Pressure transducers measure the portal venous pressure (PVP) and hepatic venous pressure (HVP), with their differential defined as EUS-PPG. Measurements obtained in supine position are designated EUS-suPPG, while those in left lateral decubitus position are termed EUS-lePPG. Statistical analysis will evaluate the correlation between EUS-suPPG and EUS-lePPG values, with postoperative monitoring for complications including infection and hemorrhage.",RECRUITING,,2025-05-20,2026-06-30,2026-05-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,40,ESTIMATED

Narrowed arteries in the brain can cause stroke. Animal studies show that nitrite injections improve blood flow and that injections over long periods of time prevent damage to the arteries in the brain; however, there is no information on the effects of prolonged nitrite infusion in humans. This study will establish the safe dose and side effects of nitrite infusion in humans.

Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened for high or low blood pressure, aspirin use, pregnancy, and blood levels of nitrite and methemoglobin (a substance that temporarily and slightly lowers the oxygen carried in the red blood cells). Pregnant women are excluded from the study.

Participants are admitted to the Clinical Center for 16 1/4 days, the first 2 days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Upon admission they provide a medical history, have physical and cardiovascular examinations, and blood tests. For the infusion procedure, a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the wrist or the crease of the elbow to measure blood pressure, and catheters are placed in a vein in each arm for administering the nitrite and withdrawing blood samples.

In the morning of day 1, after initial blood pressure and heart rate measurements are taken and a blood sample is drawn, a saline (salt water) infusion is started. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then every hour for 6 hours, then every 2 hours for 12 hours. Blood samples are collected every 4 hours for 24 hours.

If the pressure continues to remain stable, monitoring continues every 8 hours for the rest of the study. Blood is drawn periodically from the catheter to determine the amount of nitrite and methemoglobin in the body, with decreasing frequency from several times during the first hour of the infusion to every 24 hours.

It also has been shown to open blood-brain barrier facilitating transfer of chemotherapeutic agents, dilate constricted pulmonary arteries, and inhibit apoptosis, as well as modulate angiogenesis. Until recently, all these biological effects were attributed to the regional synthesis of nitric oxide by the endothelium and its local influence of vascular tone. However, ""NO bioactivity"" may be transported in blood and have biological effects at a distance from the site of entry into the circulation. These effects of NO are mediated by intravascular NO-stores. Candidates are protein and heme-bound NO species (RXNO) in plasma or erythrocytes and the oxidative NO-metabolite nitrite. Cumulating evidence suggests that nitrite may serve as a major intravascular storage pool for NO. Recent studies have shown that (1) regional, intra-arterial infusion of nitrite elicits a downstream vasodilator response in humans and (2) intravenous long-lasting administration prevents development of delayed cerebral vasospasm in a primate model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). These studies suggest a potential new therapeutic approach to many diseases. Despite extensive data documenting the pharmacokinetics and safety of the bolus and short intravascular infusions of nitrite, there are no human data evaluating safety and toxicity of prolonged delivery of nitrite, which would be required for treatment of vascular diseases.

OBJECTIVES

This study has the following objectives: (1) to determine the safety and (2) toxicity of a 48-hour and 14-day intravenous infusion of nitrite. The study should also help to elucidate the mechanism(s) through which nitrite ions contribute to vasodilation.

STUDY POPULATION

The study population will include sixteen 48-hour infusion healthy volunteers (out of 40 screened volunteers) of both genders, age 21-60, who will have a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite (the source of the drug will be determined by a CRADA).

DESIGN

This is a Phase I toxicity study of intermediate (48-hour) intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite in healthy volunteers.

OUTCOME MEASURES

Sixteen healthy volunteers of both genders, age 21-60, will have a 48-hour continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite during which the subjects' clinical condition, blood levels of nitrite/methemoglobin, hematology, blood chemistry, and pressure will be meticulously monitored.

The first subject will receive the sodium nitrite infusion at 12 mg/48 hours. This dose, according to our knowledge from the former studies and detailed analysis of pharmacokinetics of sodium nitrite, will result in blood levels of sodium nitrite below 80 nmol/L, levels that are significantly below levels reported as normal (0.5 micromol/L to 1 micromol/L). Thus, we will use the modified accelerated titration design for Phase I Clinical studies. In the accelerated design the initial patient will start with the dose 1 nmol/min/kg/48hr, i.e. 12 mg total over 48 hours for a person weighting 60 kg. Cohorts of one new subject per dose level and double dose steps will be used during the initial accelerated stage. When the first instance of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at any dose level, the next lower dose level cohort will be expanded to three patients and revert to the use of conventional modified Fibonacci escalation/de-escalation. If no DLT is observed at level 10, the cohort will be expanded to a total of three and de-escalated as appropriate. If no more than one subject among three patients experience DLT at this dose, level 10 will be considered to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

The results of this 48-hour infusion phase 1 trial will be submitted to FDA before initiation of a 14-day clinical study.",COMPLETED,,2005-02-04,2011-05-10,2011-05-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,12,ACTUAL
NCT05002322,Expanding Health Systems Research to Optimize Hypertension Care Cascade in HIV-Infected Individuals in Mozambique,Scaling Out and Scaling Up the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach to Optimize the Hypertension Diagnosis and Care Cascade for HIV-infected Individuals,"Undiagnosed and untreated hypertension is a main driver of cardiovascular disease, affecting disproportionately low and middle-income countries, where guidelines to screen and manage hypertension are poorly used. More than 13% of Mozambique adults are infected with HIV, and over 900,000 are on anti-retroviral therapy. HIV clinics are the only services within primary care providing continued care, and can be used to standardize and scale the hypertension care cascade. Hypertension affects 40% of Mozambican adults, and thus HIV and HTN often coexist in the same person.

The investigators propose to use low-cost tools that improve service performance, promote routine hypertension diagnosis and management, and ameliorate flow through the hypertension cascade, thus improving patients outcomes. Building on a current project some districts of two provinces of central Mozambique, the investigators will establish scientific evidence on the effectiveness of a tool that uses cycles of evaluation and improvement of health system, to address the hypertension care cascade in HIV-infected people. The investigators will strengthen the framework currently in use (based on nurses) setting a novel modality delivered by district health supervisors, and will expand the geographic study area by adding 6 districts of one additional province in southern Mozambique (Maputo Province), to create a foundation for national scale-up.

The Project planning phase (two years) will develop a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders, establish national technical working groups with the participation of the provinces, and identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect uptake of the results, integration of high blood pressure and HIV services, scale-up to the entire country, and sustainability of the tested framework. Additionally, the investigators will i) conduct a six-months pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district supervisor-led intervention in one primary care facility; and, ii) redesign tools and standard operating procedures, as necessary. During the implementation phase (last three years) the investigators will deploy the district-based dissemination and implementation randomized trial in 18 health facilities - using an intervention that involves assessment, effectiveness evaluation, promotion of local uptake, implementation and maintenance - and determine the costs of the hypertension care cascade optimization, by estimating the total incremental costs.","In Mozambique HIV prevalence is over 13% and hypertension (HTN) affects 40% of adults. HIV and HTN comorbidity is increasing with the aging of HIV-infected population and expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but guideline application for HTN screening and management remains low and uneven. Around 14% of adults are aware of their HTN status and only 3% of those with HTN have their condition controlled. The HIV treatment platform is the only broadly implemented chronic care service and provides an opportunity to standardize and scale HTN screening and management.

Systems-level implementation strategies may reduce drop-offs along the HTN cascade, improve service quality, and maximize availability of efficacious HTN medicines. Systems engineering tools can identify drivers of inefficiency, support locally informed provider decision-making to prioritize solutions, and improve integration of services to reduce inefficiencies in complex, multi-step health services using simple, low cost, iterative adaptations in service delivery design. The participation of frontline staff and senior management champions in this process improves patient outcomes.

The investigators aim to describe HTN care cascade at the health facility level and use it as the entry point for systems optimization of HIV services, using cascade analysis and associated systems engineering tools. In central Mozambique a Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) identified HTN cascade steps for PLHIV, developed a HTN Cascade Analysis Tool (HCAT), mapped data sources, and developed a registry to populate the HCAT and capture study outcomes from outpatient registries and patient charts (SAIA-HTN). Building on this, our project will 'scale out' through the novel modality of delivery by district health supervisors, and 'scale up' by expanding to six districts in one additional province (SCALE SAIA-HTN). It also aims at developing a dissemination and implementation model to serve as a foundation for national scaling.

Projects Aims:

1. To develop a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders and establish HTN technical working groups at the national level and participating provinces;
2. To identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect the adoption, integration, scale-up and sustainment of the SAIA-HTN implementation strategy;
3. To conduct a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district MOH supervisor-led SAIA-HTN intervention over six months in one primary care facility (to redesign tools and standard operating procedures as necessary);
4. Develop a district-based dissemination and implementation of SAIA-HTN (SCALE SAIA-HTN) using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model to evaluate the program: a. Determine the proportion of health facilities and population in the six districts reached, and identification of sub-groups not reached (target: 33% of facilities and 80% HIV+ adults reached); b.Assess the intervention effect on HTN process measures (BP screening, HTN diagnosis, HTN medication initiation, maintenance on HTN treatment), and HTN treatment effectiveness (HTN control, HIV viral load suppression); c.Determine the proportion of districts and facilities adopting the intervention (target: 95%), and explore the determinants of adoption identified using the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC); d.Determine core elements of the scaled SAIA-HTN implementation process and describe drivers of success/failure using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); e.Calculate the proportion of districts sustaining the intervention 9, 18, 27 months post-introduction (target: \>90% at 9 months, \>80% at 18 months, and \>65% at 27 months).
5. Determine the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization, including total incremental and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care.

Methods: The investigators will use the SAIA strategy to visualize and quantify interconnected service delivery steps, informed by previous SAIA research, epidemiologic research on HTN, and ongoing SAIA-HTN research to optimize HTN screening, care and treatment for PLHIV in central Mozambique (to evaluate SAIA-HTN's effectiveness on systems' and patient-level health outcomes for PLHIV).

Study Plan: The investigators will use multiple novel implementation science methods to understand and explain what influences implementation outcomes, including i) the CFIR to identify barriers and facilitators (determinants) to implementation, ii) the ORIC scale to assesses readiness for change as an organizational-level determinant of adoption, and iii) the RE-AIM evaluative Framework, which measures the active ingredients for public health impact (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance).

Planning phase: The investigators will mobilize a multi-sectoral stakeholder partnership, conduct a needs assessment (to evaluate facilitators and barriers that could affect adoption, integration, scale-up and sustainment of SCALE SAIA-HTN in the two provinces), and pilot the intervention's feasibility and acceptability over six months in one clinics (to refine implementation procedures for follow-on scaling out and scaling up).Implementation phase: 'scale out' SAIA-HTN to test a novel delivery modality (using district supervisors), 'scale up' to cover six districts in Maputo province, and evaluate its impact on cascade performance and patient outcomes. The investigators will randomly allocate health facilities from the six districts in Maputo Province into three implementation waves, staggered by nine months (27 months total).

The SAIA-HTN implementation strategy uses an iterative, five-step process applied at the facility level to give clinic staff and managers a systems view of cascade performance, identify priority areas for improvement, discern modifiable solutions, and test workflow modifications.

SCALE SAIA-HTN will test integration and scale up of SAIA-HTN through routine management systems relying on district Ministry of Health (MOH) supervisors as the disseminating agents (rather than research nurses), in three facilities per district during a nine-month intensive phase (mentored by study assistants), and subsequent sustainment phase (led independently by district MOH supervisors). Based on trial results, the investigators will model out the costs and potential benefits on HTN management for PLHIV given different scale-up scenarios nationwide. The trial will culminate in the development and dissemination of the SCALE SAIA-HTN package, summarizing trial results and providing implementation and cost guidance to inform policy development and support national scale-up through routine management structures.

Study design: phased-in (stepped wedge) with random assignment of two districts to each of the three nine-month intervention waves, to reach six districts in Maputo Province by the end of the trial.

Study Setting: Maputo Province (population of \>1.5 million inhabitants; \>98% of formal health services offered through public sector clinics). Health facilities with highest numbers of active HIV+ patients on ART will be enrolled.

Study Team: This project brings together a diverse and uniquely qualified team of cardiovascular, HIV, community surveys, health systems, and implementation scientists.

Procedures Stakeholders meetings: to create a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders and establish HTN technical working groups (TWG) at the national level and with participating provinces.

Stakeholder field visits to SAIA-HTN trial in central Mozambique: for key personnel and district MOH supervisors from the pilot facility.

Orientation meetings/workshops: for introducing SCALE SAIA-HTN, the implementation approach, and evaluation design to study investigators, provincial MOH managers, and district MOH supervisors in each province, who will review and agree on study procedures, and clinical and organizational skills-building approaches. Throughout the two phases of the project the TWG will inform on mediators and mechanisms of action, scale-up and sustainment efforts, and ensure responsiveness to local needs; at end of the planning phase, the TWG will review findings, discuss necessary adaptations and refine SCALE SAIA-HTN for the implementation phase.

Standardized readiness assessments: in the six first wave health facilities to assess structural and organizational readiness to deliver HTN services (ORIC measures, staffing levels, attributes and training, availability of essential commodities, equipment and supplies, and infrastructure) and repeated for subsequent waves prior to launching intensive implementation phases.

Pilot study: Outpatient staff managing HIV/CVD care and district MOH supervisors will participate in orientation training for the feasibility and acceptability of the SCALE SAIA-HTN intervention, which will be carried out over six months in one primary care facility. Tools and standard operating procedures will be redesigned as necessary for the implementation phase. Facility-based HTN screening will be carried out by nurses at entry into the pilot facility; all hypertensive (new and existing) patients will be recruited, with the support of district supervisors and study teams. Feasibility and acceptability will include i) measurement of intervention fidelity, reach and exposure, and adoption; ii) knowledge and competency questionnaire to health personnel. Follow-up visits to both monitor and support implementation will be carried out twice in the first month, and monthly thereafter. Additional data will be collected by: focus group discussion (FGD) with key staff to assess acceptability of content and delivery of the intervention; questionnaire to participating staff pre and post-intervention; key informant interviews with the district supervisors, facility managers and frontline staff.

Evaluate programs' Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Reach: determine the number, proportion/representativeness of individuals reached by interventions; use study reports to estimate the proportion of facilities in the six districts reached by SCALE SAIA-HTN (target: 30%); determine the number and proportion of HIV-infected adults with HTN reached (target: 80%).

Effectiveness: HTN treatment effectiveness (primary effectiveness outcome: HTN control, Secondary outcomes: HIV viral load suppression, proportion of HIV- infected patients screened for HTN in outpatient services, HTN diagnosis, HTN prescription of eligible patients, \>90% patient adherence to HTN treatment).

Adoption: ORIC assessment scale (target of 95%) used to six frontline staff working across the HIV-HTN cascade and facility leadership in each clinic (n=108), and two supervisors (NCD and HIV) from each district (n=12) to describe determinants of adoption.

Implementation: Tools at CFIR website will be adapted to gather data via interviews and FGDs with facility and district staff (qualitative), intervention meeting minutes (qualitative), and annual quantitative questionnaires to quantify facility structural determinants of implementation of HTN management guidelines.

Maintenance. Proportion of districts sustaining the intervention as designed 9, 18 and 27 months post-introduction (target: \>90% at 9 months, \>80% at 18 months, and \>65% at 27 months). In-depth interviews and FGDs to probe district/facility perspectives on determinants of sustainment

Determination of the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization: total incremental and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care. For cost estimation activity-based cost menus will identify start up and recurrent activities, and measure resource use and costs from design through implementation.

NCT03285230,The French E3N Prospective Cohort Study,The French E3N Prospective Cohort Study (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale),"The French E3N cohort was initiated in 1990 to investigate the risk factors associated with cancer and other major non-communicable diseases in women.

The participants were insured through a national health system that primarily covered teachers, and were enrolled from 1990 after returning baseline self-administered questionnaires and providing informed consent. The cohort comprised nearly 100 000 women with baseline ages ranging from 40 to 65 years.

Follow-up questionnaires were sent approximately every 2-3 years after the baseline and addressed general and lifestyle characteristics together with medical events (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, fractures and asthma, among others). The follow-up questionnaire response rate remained stable at approximately 80%.

A biological material bank was generated and included blood samples collected from 25 000 women and saliva samples from an additional 47 000 women.

Ageing among the E3N cohort provided the opportunity to investigate factors related to agerelated diseases and conditions as well as disease survival.","Who is in the cohort? In June 1990, a questionnaire was sent to 500 000 women who had been born between 1925 and 1950 and were insured by the Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale (MGEN), a national health insurance plan that primarily covers teachers. The questionnaire was sent along with a leaflet explaining that an Inserm research team was launching a study of cancer risk factors and that participation would require filling in questionnaires every 2-3 years as well as the submission of a signed consent form providing permission to obtain information about each participant's vital status, address changes and medical expense reimbursements from the insurance plan. Nearly 100 000 women volunteered.

How often have they been followed-up? Until now, nine follow-up questionnaires have been sent every 2-3 years from the baseline. Approximately half of the answers were obtained after the first mailing. Two reminders were sent thereafter. The questionnaires were accompanied with newsletters that informed participants about the major results obtained to date. The participation rate remained high (77-92% according to the questionnaires) and the lost to follow-up rate was minimal because of the ability to trace non-respondents through their insurance plan files. The questionnaires were accurately filled in, with few missing or unacceptable answers.

What has been measured? To date, 11 self-administered questionnaires have been sent. The collected data are sociodemographic factors, anthropometric measurements, reproductive factors, hormonal treatments, health behaviour and lifestyle. Each follow-up questionnaire also recorded the participant's health status. The questionnaires are available at www.e3n.fr .

The questionnaires are anonymous and identified with an identification number and pin code that can be rapidly scanned to identify the respondents. The questionnaires are optically scanned and all answers are checked on screen. The scanned images are saved to allow data entry at a later time, including information regarding the addresses of medical doctors (18 000 to date) or drug names (pre-listed to avoid errors). The longitudinal data (repeats of identical questions for the purpose of updating information about topics such as menopause or smoking) are routinely homogenized. Several validation studies (e.g. dietary and anthropometrical data studies) have been performed and have revealed very satisfactory results.

Self-reported cases of cancer are validated and coded after reviewing the pathology reports obtained from medical practitioners, and nearly 90% of all cancer cases are histologically confirmed. Other diseases are also validated (e.g. diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, Parkinson disease) by requesting additional information about the participants (e.g. glycosylated haemoglobin levels, fracture-related circumstances, drug names) and sending questionnaires to medical doctors.

Additionally, a biological material bank was generated. Blood samples were initially collected from 1994-99. The participation rate among the invited participants was approximately 40%; this yielded approximately 25 000 blood samples that were each separated into 28 aliquots (e.g. plasma, serum, leukocytes, erythrocytes). Plastic straws were used to store each participant's samples in liquid nitrogen containers. The bio-repositories are located at the IARC (Lyon) and the EFS (Etablissement Français du Sang, Annemasse). Since 2004, approximately 10 case-control studies have been conducted (approximately 1 800 cases and 3 500 controls) with regard to the measurements of various biomarkers (e.g. fatty acids, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B, cholesterol and C-reactive protein). A metabolomics study is currently ongoing.

From 2009-11, saliva samples (Oragene, DNA Genotek, Kanata, ON, Canada) were requested from 68 242 living women and were obtained from 47 000 women (participation rate, 69%). Salivary DNA has been extracted and has been used for genotyping in two case-control studies (approximately 2 500 cases and 850 controls) since December 2010.

The research team is currently planning to set up a tumour tissue bank and will begin with the collection of breast cancer tissues.

What has it found? The E3N cohort has produced a spectrum of results regarding the complex roles played by nutrition, hormonal factors, physical activity, anthropometric characteristics and other major lifestyle-related factors with respect to various diseases.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,1990-06-15,2025-12-15,1991-11-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,100000,ACTUAL

The central hypothesis is that dysregulated glucose metabolism elicits a response in PAH patients that can be modified by exercise and diet, thereby leading to improvements in pulmonary vascular disease.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) leads to premature death as a consequence of increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right heart failure. PAH-targeted therapies developed over the past 20 years target excessive vasoconstriction. However, the pathobiology of PAH is more complicated, and includes dysregulated vascular cell proliferation, cellular metabolic abnormalities, and inflammation. Even with modern PAH therapies, current outcomes remain poor, with an estimated 3-year survival rate of only 55%. Thus, there is a clear need for more effective therapies, based on better understanding of the pathobiology of the disease.

Insulin resistance has emerged as a potential new mechanism in PAH. Animal models of insulin resistance are associated with PAH, which reverses with the administration of insulin sensitizing drugs. Over the past decade there has been an epidemiologic shift in PAH, where the disease is increasingly observed in older, obese, and diabetic subjects. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in PAH, a feature of insulin resistance, have been observed and found to be a strong independent predictor of PAH mortality. Elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) also correlates with PAH diagnosis and severity. As measured by the OGTT, idiopathic PAH patients have not only insulin resistance, but also an inability to mount an appropriate insulin response to a glucose challenge. These data point to dysfunction in the pancreatic beta cells of PAH patients. It is known that an exercise and low glycemic index diet intervention improves insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic subjects.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2017-09-27,2025-06-30,2022-02-18,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,34,ACTUAL

All patients, except those excluded (n=44), were open block randomized to follow two treatment regimens: ""traditional"" or ""current"" and to receive active telephone calls (""phone calls"" group) or not to receive telephone calls (""no phone calls"" group).","To evaluate the importance of providing guidelines to patients via active telephone calls for blood pressure management and the discontinuation of treatment in hypertensive patients, using two treatment regimens with low-dose medications, which were offered for free to avoid the influence of the financial factor. We opted for a regimen called ""traditional"" based on diuretics and beta-blockers, and another one called ""current"" treatment based on the angiotensin II antagonist and calcium channel blocker.

Patients and Methods The patients studied were those with essential hypertension who could receive telephone calls to be reminded of the dates of their medical appointments and to receive guidance about hypertension; patients were of both genders, from any ethnic background, over 18 years old and with body mass index below 40 kg/m2, and were enrolled in the study after signing a free and informed consent term. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors in the General Hospital at the São Paulo University School of Medicine.

Exclusion criteria were patients with blood pressure \< 140/90 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, pregnant women or nursing mothers, patients with secondary hypertension, white-coat hypertension with systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg at the doctor's office and awake mean systolic pressure \< 135 mm Hg or awake mean diastolic pressure \< 85 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, malignant hypertension, presence of liver dysfunction evidenced by the patient's clinical history or by one of the liver function tests with levels twice the normal values (alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase), patients with clinical conditions that might interfere with the total conformity with the study or those who might have increased risk for participating in the study, patients with previous history of hypersensitivity reaction to the study medications, patients with a history of alcoholism, drug abuse or mental disorders that might invalidate the free and informed consent or limit the patient's ability to meet the protocol rules, patients who had participated in any other studies involving investigational drugs or drugs already marketed within the previous month, before enrollment in this study or concomitantly with this study.

Measurement of blood pressure was performed five times by the nursing staff in right upper limb, with patient sitting, using a cuff of appropriate size to the arm and a validated automatic oscillometric device (Dixtal, DX 2710, São Paulo, Brazil) The mean of the last two measurements was calculated and recorded as long as the difference between these measurements was less than 4 mm Hg. If after the 5 measurements the difference between the last two ones was higher than 4 mm Hg, the measurement was repeated until the difference between the two measurements was less than 4 mm Hg.

The diagnosis of hypertension was made when the mean values of the last two measurements were: systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg with or without medication in the initial visit (Visit 0). Patients who were receiving antihypertensive medication at the initial visit and had systolic pressure \< 140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure \< 90 mm Hg were re-evaluated 8 weeks after discontinuation of their medication and introduction of placebo, and they were included in the study when the mean values were systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg.

All the patients underwent Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) performed with a validated oscillometric device (SpaceLabs 90207, SpaceLabs Inc, Richmond, WA, USA) , 5 weeks after start of the placebo to eliminate the cases of patients with white-coat hypertension and in patients who did not receive placebo to identify the white coat effect.

Patients were assigned to two groups: a) ""uncomplicated"" - composed of hypertensive patients without complications and without other concurrent diseases; and b) ""complicated"", including patients with severe hypertension (mean diastolic pressure \> 110 mm Hg with or without medication) or comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus 7, renal failure (serum creatinine \> 1.4mg/dL), coronary insufficiency, congestive heart failure or prior history of cerebrovascular accident.

All patients, from both the complicated and the uncomplicated group, were open block randomized to receive active telephone calls (""phone calls"" group) or not to receive telephone calls (""no phone calls"" group) and to follow two treatment regimens: ""traditional"" and ""current"".

Thus, after the first visit and randomization, patients from the ""phone calls"" group were invited to enroll by telephone in the program called ""Biosintética Assistance"" supported by Biosintética Laboratory. The patients who subscribed started receiving active telephone calls from appropriately trained operators as well as magazines with health-related information, which were sent periodically by mail. There were 6 contacts by telephone during the study. The patient was reminded to attend the next visit; he/she received instructions about hypertension as well as any necessary clarifications. All the patients randomized to the ""phone calls"" group were invited to attend occasional informative lectures with the participation of a multidisciplinary team.

At the initial stage of treatment, the ""uncomplicated"" group received, after 8 weeks of treatment with placebo, one of the following treatment regimens: a) ""traditional"" treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg 2x/day and atenolol 25 mg 2x/day; and b) ""current"" treatment with losartan 25 mg 2x/day and amlodipine 2.5 mg 2x/day. If blood pressure could not be controlled during the visits, the medications had their doses doubled or another antihypertensive was added. The ""complicated"" group did not undergo the treatment period with placebo and was randomized to receive ""traditional"" or ""current"" drug regimens similar to the ones administered to the ""uncomplicated"" group, considering the specificity of each condition. The addition of other antihypertensive agents in the ""uncomplicated"" group, as well as the specificities of regimens of patients in the ""complicated"" group, were performed according to the guidelines from the V Brazilian Guidelines on Arterial Hypertension. 5 All the patients were instructed to take the medication every day at 7:00 am and 7:00 pm, with a variation of up to one hour. All the medication necessary for 12 months of treatment was supplied to the patients by the physician at the end of the visit in sufficient amount at no cost until the next visit, in order to eliminate the financial factor in this analysis. Patients were instructed to bring the remaining pills during their subsequent visit to be counted by the nursing staff, without the patients' knowledge of this procedure.

Doctors' visits, preceded by the nursing staff visit, took place every 8 weeks for 56 weeks with measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and weight. The weight was checked with the patient wearing light clothes and barefoot on a scale (model 2096PP, Toledo do Brasil, São Paulo, SP, Brazil).

Chronotherapy, which describes timing of a treatment with the body's daily rhythms, has recently been used with hypertension medications and has been shown to be effective at lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease events. Specifically, taking medications in the evening was shown to be more effective than morning medication routines. Little information is available about the effectiveness of chronotherapy combined with exercise (i.e., planned physical activity) interventions in older adults with hypertension.

NCT00353925,Genetic Analysis of African-Americans With High Blood Pressure,Genetic Analysis of African-American Hypertensives,"The purpose of this study is to learn if kinase, a protein found in the heart, contributes to thickening of the heart muscle in people with high blood pressure.

A protein called myosin causes the heart to contract and relax. It is thought that kinase changes myosin to make it work better at different heart rates. This study will try to determine if, in some people with high blood pressure, the different forms of this protein cause changes in the heart. If the protein affects the size of the heart, it might be possible to use it to improve heart function after an injury, such as a heart attack.

African-Americans with high blood pressure will be eligible for this study. Current data show that of almost 900 multi-ethnic individuals, the particular form of kinase under study in this project is found exclusively in the African-American population. Study participants will have two tubes of blood drawn for DNA testing to determine what form of kinase is present. An electrocardiogram will also be done if a recent one is not available. Some people may also have an echocardiogram, an ultrasound test to image the heart.","Genetic and in vitro mechanical studies in our laboratory have suggested that the perturbations in the phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) can modulate cardiac function and produce a compensatory hypertrophic response. We have cloned a novel human cardiac kinase (MLCK) that targets the cardiac RLC and identified a common allele unique to the African-American population. The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate a large group of African-American individuals with hypertension and/or cardiac disease, a portion of who will possess this allele. It is well documented that hypertensive African-Americans have an increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We expect that, in this population of hypertensive individuals, we will find an increased left ventricular mass in individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for this kinase allele.

In this study, patients with the allele can be matched to others in the cohort without the allele and evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac MRI to evaluate cardiac function and chamber size. In addition, metabolic stress testing will be performed to assess the implications of this allele on clinical performance. Another group of 75 Afro-Americans with dilated cardiomyopathy will be referred from local heart failure clinics and evaluated in a similar fashion. Allele prevalence and associated cardiac findings will also be compared with hypertensive patients matched for age and gender. In a parallel experiment, mice over-expressing this kinase, are being generated and will provide us with tissue samples with which to pursue the biophysical basis of the mechanical changes in muscle function.",COMPLETED,,1999-10-05,2007-12-10,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1000,

In particular, this study will examine the use of conduction system pacing (CSP) in clinical practice. Information collected in the registry will help researchers better characterize strengths and limitations of current technology and treatments.","During this past decade, there has been a dramatic surge in interest in new physiologic pacing strategies which engage and take advantage of the intrinsic cardiac conduction system. These approaches include His bundle pacing (HBP) as well as approaches which seek to pace the proximal left conduction system (LCS), including left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) or pacing in the region of the left posterior fascicle. Left ventricular septal pacing (LVS) has also been proposed as another means to avoid dyssynchrony with early data suggestive of comparable electrical synchronization as biventricular pacing. These approaches utilize approved pacing systems and leads which are delivered to new targets in the His-Purkinje system or LV endocardial fibers. Despite the growing interest in HBP, LCS, and LVS, the majority of data are from disparate cohort studies and there has been a lack of uniformity in assembling data or analyzing and interpreting outcomes.

The goal of the Conduction System Pacing International Registry (CONSPIRE) is to systematically and prospectively collect data across multiple centers of excellence on the early implementation of permanent conduction system pacing devices in order to characterize strengths and limitations of current technology.

The effects of self-measuring of the blood pressure at home and the use of a pro-active web-based feedback system on the blood pressure, number of antihypertensive drugs used, and surrogate cardiovascular markers during a 12 month period will be investigated.","Patients are assigned to the intervention or control group (1:1 ratio) by the research nurse based on a computer-generated allocation sequence. Stratified randomization will be performed to allocate equal numbers of patients with and without diabetes in both groups. This is an open trial without masking of the participants or investigators. Outcome measures are not blinded.

Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study. After informed consent is given, all patients will be seen by the nurse practitioner and the doctor (coordinator of the study) for an intake. During this intake patients will be informed about the study, medical history will be taken, questionnaires are completed a physical examination is performed and BP measurements and laboratory tests are performed. The patients will also receive information about hypertension and personal lifestyle advises during the intake. After inclusion, patients are randomized into two groups:

1. Control group: After the intake the patients will receive usual care at the outpatient clinic. After one year the coordinator of the study and the nurse practitioner will see the control group patients for a final evaluation. During this evaluation, the questionnaires, measurements and laboratory tests are repeated.
2. Intervention group: After the intake, patients receive a HBP-monitor and a login account to a personal website. Furthermore, instructions about the use of the home blood pressure monitor and the website will be given. The web-based program can be used by the patient to upload the blood pressure readings and to communicate with the nurse practitioner or to the doctor and vice versa. Patients can ask questions daily and will receive personal lifestyle advices on monthly basis. If needed, medication adjustments will be made based on the blood pressure measurements. Online information will be provided to the patients as a reference work with information about hypertension, treatment strategies and technical facts of the blood pressure monitor and the website. Patients in the intervention group will visit their own physician in the OPD after 6 months, instead of every 3 months. If necessary patients can visit their physician earlier. If patients have multiple diseases, regular visits to the internal medicine department are not restricted.

After 12 months, patients in the intervention and control groups are seen for the final evaluation.

Data registered only during intake:

* Medication
* Quality of life: This is assessed by the SF-12 Health Survey
* Physical examination:

  * Height and weight, BMI
  * Waist circumference
  * Blood pressure: This will be measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and an office blood pressure (OBP) measurement.
  * Signs of secondary hypertension
  * Signs of organ damage
* Lifestyle habits:

  * Physical activity: The level of physical activity is measured with the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) \[19\].
  * Diet: Saturated fat intake and Fruit and Vegetable intake are measured with two validated Dutch Questionnaires \[20, 21\]. Salt intake is measured with 24-hour urine analysis.
  * Alcohol consumption: Respondents are asked how much glasses alcohol they drink per week on average.
  * Smoking: Smoking status is assessed by asking respondents if they are current smokers (what they smoke, how much they smoke, intention to quit smoking), an ex-smoker (how many pack years or never-smoked).
  * Quality of life: This is measured by the SF-12-health survey
* Laboratory tests:

  * Thyroid-stimulating hormone
  * Microalbuminuria / proteinuria (24-hour urine collection)

Measurement procedures:

In both groups a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement will be performed at the start of the study and after 12 months. After the start of the study, the intervention group will measure their own blood pressure with the use of the ""Microlife WatchBP"" Home blood pressure monitor with an inflatable cuff for the upper arm. This meter is approved by the Dutch Heart Foundation \[18\]. The measurements are automatically transferred to a secured website (https://www.bpathome.com/main/ageneral.html) when the meter is connected with a computer using an USB-portal. This website can be approached by the caregivers and the patients. Patients are instructed to measure according to the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for blood pressure monitoring at home. During HBP measurement the following recommendations are made:

* The arm must be supported (on a table)
* The arm is positioned at heart level
* All measurements are performed on the same arm (arm with highest blood pressure during intake)
* During intake the size of the inflatable bladder is determined (length of inflatable bladder should cover 80-100% of the arm circumference, the width is half that length)
* The centre of the bladder is placed over the brachial artery.

The intervention group will measure their BP according to the guideline for blood pressure monitoring at home:

- HBP is monitored for 7 days at a stretch every month with two morning and two evening measurements. The average of all values will be used for clinical decision making, with the exception of the first day, which will be discarded.

Diagnostic and therapeutic thresholds:

Cut-off limits for conventional blood pressure measures are not applicable for HBPM, therefore different cut-off limits are used. Hypertension will be diagnosed by HBPM starting at BP levels of 135/85 mmHg for patients without diabetes and 130/75 mmHg for patients with Diabetes. The target HBP for therapy is below these thresholds. For OBP, hypertension will be diagnosed at BP levels of 140/90 mmHg for patients without diabetes and 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes, the target OBP is below this threshold.

Safety limits are set on readings greater than 200/100 mmHg or systolic BP less than 80 mmHg, which will trigger an alert in the system.

Pharmacological therapy:

All patients enrolled in the study will continue their current blood pressure medication.

The medication and dose adjustments in patients randomized to the intervention group will be done monthly by the nurse practitioner or the coordinating physician based on their HBP measurements. Patients in the study group can communicate with the coordinating doctor by the secured website. Medication adjustments are made by a physician and communicated by the web-based system or telephone. Medication adjustments are made based on the European guidelines. When necessary the doctor who coordinates the study can consult a senior physician to discuss about the medication changes. These patients will see there own physicians 6 months after the inclusion, provided these patients only have hypertension. If patients have multiple diseases, regular visits are not restricted. The head of the outpatients clinic will supervise the coordinating doctor during the study.

Patients randomized to the non-intervention group will receive usual care and their own specialist will make the necessary medication adjustments, during their visits to the outpatient clinic or during hospitalization.

Lifestyle interventions:

Patients in the intervention group will receive both general and personal lifestyle-advices every month and when patients have questions about lifestyle.

Multiple aspects will be taken into account:

* Smoking cessation: For counseling and help with smoking cessation, the guidelines of a Dutch expert centre for tobacco control 'STIVORO' will be followed.
* Moderation of alcohol consumption: Advice on alcohol consumption is based on the national guidelines of acceptable alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Women are advised not to drink more than one consumption a day and men are advised not to drink more than 2 consumptions a day. Furthermore the risks associated with binge-drinking are explained.
* Regular physical activity: Patients are advised to put together at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on at least five days a week, according to the guideline of healthy physical activity in the primary care. Moderate to intense exercise includes for example: walking, cycling, gardening, swimming and dancing.
* Reduction of high salt and fat intake: Patients are advised not to consume more than 6 grams of salt during the day. Furthermore the total daily intake of fat is aimed to be less than 30% of total daily energy intake and the saturated fatty acids less than 10% of total daily energy intake. Dietary interventions are based on the national guidelines of healthy diet.",UNKNOWN,,2011-09,2013-03,2013-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,300,ESTIMATED

The approach to this risk factor can be pharmacological and non-pharmacological. The non-pharmacological approach is based on lifestyle modification. Among the measures aimed at modifying lifestyles is the restriction of daily intake of sodium in the diet. Such restriction enhances the hypotensive effect of pharmacological treatment so that its application and intensification would delay the start of pharmacological therapy, as well as avoid the need to increase the dose of antihypertensive drugs or the number of drugs to be used for the control of hypertension.

In relation to salt intake in the Spanish population, the average is above the figures of less than 5 grams per day recommended by the WHO. Sodium intake can be estimated by determining the 24-hour urine sodium concentration. In addition, there is a positive correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure figures and the excretion of sodium in urine.","In the present work, with a prospective cohort observational study design, it intends to assess the effectiveness of the use of an educational program based on the follow up of a hyposodium diet and assessed through the routine use of urine sodium monitoring of the hypertensive patient in the primary care setting, in order to optimize treatment, as well as to review the clinical control in this group of patients. On the other hand, it is intended to establish guidelines in the form of practical guidelines to provide with a standardized clinical approach for primary care centers.",TERMINATED,the principal investigator withdraws from the project for personal reasons,2020-09-01,2022-09-01,2022-09-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,2,ACTUAL
NCT00005325,Identifying Genes Involved in Abnormal Blood Pressure - Hypertension SCOR,,To seek out genes or genetic markers which identify subjects more vulnerable to hypertension under the influence of environmental factors.,"BACKGROUND:

Essential hypertension is a multifactorial disorder with a Gaussian distribution and with a genetic component that appears to be polygenic and heterogeneous. The studies require clinical knowledge of the pathophysiology and therapy of hypertension, availability of a large racially diverse patient population and a General Clinical Research Center for recruitment, characterization and classification of subjects, in combination with knowledge of molecular biology for DNA preparation and expertise in molecular genetics and molecular epidemiology for genetic analysis.

The study is part of a Specialized Centers of Research initiative in the Molecular Genetics of Hypertension. The initiative originated in deliberations of the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. In May 1993, a program evaluation committee convened by the NHLBI was charged with the task of assessing the overall goals of the Hypertension SCOR program and of recommending areas of future need. The committee's recommendations formed the basis of this proposed initiative which was released as a Request for Applications in December, 1993.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study, a subproject within a Hypertension Specialized Center of Research (SCOR), had five substudies between 1996 and 2001. The first classified hypertensives into relatively homogeneous subgroups according to intermediate phenotypes based on heritable biological traits, including anthropometric and neurohumoral data obtained by submitting selected subjects to a 3-day inpatient protocol, from which data were extrapolated and applied to stratify larger subject populations in order to enhance efficacy of subsequent genetic analysis. The second substudy genotyped subjects for chromosomal loci using approximately 350 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers spaced every 5-10 centimorgans (cM) along each chromosome. The strategy was to initially type markers in a select group of hypertensive kindreds that independently demonstrated linkage. The third substudy analyzed the genetic marker data for linkage using both parametric (lod score) and nonparametric (affected-pedigree-member) methods. Suggestive findings were pursued in the sib-pairs. The fourth substudy used the case-control method to confirm positive linkage from substudy 3 and to identify particular allele associations using methods of linkage disequilibrium and DNA pooling. The fifth substudy screened and assessed mutations in candidate genes linked to hypertension in patients and controls. A collaboration was established with the Framingham Heart Study, with linkage analyses conducted for hypertension in this cohort.

The subproject was renewed in February 2001 through 2006 to continue the clinical studies and to expand the collection of hypertensive families, including subjects who have undergone extensive clinical evaluation and who can be subgrouped into intermediate phenotypes, as well as families from genetically isolated populations from Greece, Israel, and South Africa. Various subsets of this population will be submitted to different genetic analyses as appropriate, including linkage and association studies, genome-wide scan for genetic isolates, evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected genes, testing of quantitative trait loci (QTL) by micro satellite markers and mapping of promising marrow regions by DNA sequencing.",COMPLETED,,1996-02,2006-07,2006-07,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,0,

NCT00005222,Decline in Cardiovascular Mortality: Framingham 1950-1984,,To investigate possible mechanisms responsible for the decline in cardiovascular disease mortality among the Framingham Heart Study population and to evaluate the health status of survivors in terms of subsequent illness and functional limitations.,"BACKGROUND:

Cardiovascular disease mortality has declined more than 30 percent in the last thirty years. Almost two-thirds of this decline occurred between 1970 and 1980. Despite this decreased mortality, cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death. It is also the disease category associated with the most rapidly rising health care costs. Secular trends in lifestyle, self-care, improved access to medical care, and improvements in diagnostic and curative medicine have all been implicated. An understanding of the mechanisms contributing to this decline is necessary in order to develop a scientific basis for palliative and preventive care. Also, the dramatic decline in cardiovascular disease mortality has raised the issue of the quality of life among the survivors. The question is raised whether more people are surviving but with worsening health in terms of increased incidence and prevalence of disease as well as increased levels of functional limitation.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Five hypotheses were tested to address the issue of secular trends in lifestyle, self-care and medical care which may have influenced cardiovascular disease mortality. These were: differences in risk factor levels among similarly-aged birth cohorts influenced mortality by lessening the severity of disease or by improving recuperative capacity; mortality among the later birth cohorts declined due to less comorbid disease at the time of the disease event; long-term case fatality declined because the progression of disease was slower as evidenced by a reduction in disease recurrence; medical intervention reduced mortality by eliminating lethal sequelae in the later birth cohorts; decreased mortality resulted from medical innovations in diagnosis and therapy. Three hypotheses were tested to address the issue of worsening health among the survivors in the later birth cohorts. These were: although more individuals in the later birth cohorts survived 13 years of follow-up than did members of similarly-aged birth cohorts in earlier periods, they had higher rates of morbidity and were hospitalized more often; survivors in the later cohorts exhibited more disability in functional limitations; more survivors in the later cohorts were institutionalized in chronic care hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. Data on risk factors, co-morbidity, and recurrent cardiovascular disease in the three birth cohorts were already computerized. Data on medical interventions, improvement in case management, and the use of various technological innovations were abstracted from medical records and linked with the data on disease events. Data on functional limitations were available both by type and extent of disability from the Disability Analysis of Health Data, a study supported by the Social Security Administration. This data file was merged with the file for disease events to determine if general differences in functional health existed among the three birth cohorts at intake, and if between-cohort differences existed among survivors.

The study was renewed as a Shannon Award in Fiscal 1991.

NCT01990625,A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Ultrasound Use to Improve Pregnancy Outcomes in Low Income Country Settings,Global Network First Look: A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Ultrasound Use to Improve Pregnancy Outcomes in Low Income Country Settings,"In many low-income countries, the use of ultrasound by medical officers and non-physician health care staff (e.g., midwives) for antenatal identification of high risk pregnancies is a new intervention requiring authoritative investigation. The primary hypothesis to be assessed in this study is that antenatal ultrasound screenings performed by medical officers and non-physician health care staff will significantly reduce a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and maternal near miss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. Underpinning this hypothesis are two assumptions. The first assumption is that antenatal detection of complicated pregnancies will lead to appropriate referral at the right time for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. The second assumption is that ultrasound's introduction will increase antenatal attendance leading to greater rates of institutional delivery. To assess these underlying assumptions beyond the composite end point, this study will investigate the health system impact of compact ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC facilities, referral rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both planned and emergent) and an assessment of medical officers and non-physician health care provider ultrasound competence and training quality.","The use of ultrasound by physician and non-physician health care staff for antenatal identification of complicated pregnancies is a potentially effective intervention; however, authoritative investigation in many low-resource settings is needed to establish its potential impact. The investigators propose to undertake a multi-country, cluster randomized trial to assess the impact of antenatal ultrasound screening performed by community physician and non-physician health care staff on a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and near miss maternal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. Underpinning this objective are several assumptions. The first assumption is that ultrasound's introduction will increase antenatal attendance and improved outcomes due to the antenatal care alone, and greater rates of institutional delivery. The second assumption is that ultrasound use will lead to antenatal detection of complicated pregnancies and timely and appropriate referral for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. Increases in antenatal care utilization and referral will result in a decrease in a composite outcome including maternal mortality and near miss mortality, stillbirth and neonatal death. Secondary outcomes to be evaluated include antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC facilities, referral rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both planned and emergent), an assessment of community physician and non-physician health care provider ultrasound training and competence and the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound in community health facilities. The investigators will also determine causes for non-compliance with recommendations for referral.

In summary, this trial will evaluate whether training antenatal health care providers to perform basic obstetric ultrasonography, and using these trainees to provide routine ultrasounds in primary care clinics and to refer appropriately will improve pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings.

To assess the impact of ultrasound, the investigators propose to utilize an existing research infrastructure, the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research (Global Network), which currently includes 7 sites in 6 countries, India (2), Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, DRC and Guatemala. The investigators of the Global Network have an ongoing maternal and newborn health registry to document all pregnancies and their outcomes to 6 weeks post-delivery in more than 100 communities. Thus, population-based rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality and morbidity, as well as health care utilization, are being obtained. A sub-set of these clusters will be utilized for the ultrasound trial.

RTI International serves as the data coordinating center for the Global Network to help facilitate the design and conduct of the trial, manage the trial related data, and provide statistical analyses of the trial results. GE Healthcare will provide the ultrasound equipment, and will also fund the University of Washington to provide training and technical support on the implementation of ultrasound in community settings. Together, the Global Network with the support of the University of Washington and GE Healthcare will maximize the resources necessary to conduct a definitive trial on the potential impact of ultrasound to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and maternal morbidity in low-resource settings.",COMPLETED,,2014-04,2016-09,2016-08,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,45038,ACTUAL

NCT05349825,Investigation of MDR1 Gene Polymorphism and Losartan Plasma Concentration in Patients Undergoing Hypertensive Episodes While Under Losartan Treatment,"Investigation of MDR1 (Multi-Drug Resistance) Gene Polymorphism and Losartan Plasma Concentration in Patients Undergoing Hypertensive Episodes While Under Losartan Treatment: A Prospective, Case-Control Study","Losartan is an antihypertensive drug belonging to the ARB family. It is characterized as the substrate of the Multi Drug Resistance-1 (MDR1) drug-efflux protein (a pump that ensures the removal of drugs/foreign substances out of the cell) encoded by the ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1 (ABCB1) gene. A recent line of evidence indicates that potential polymorphisms in this gene tend to alter the absorption, transport, bioavailability of losartan, and, indirectly, its effectiveness in hypertension control. As identified by new research, the C3435T, G2677T, and C1236T polymorphic alleles of the MDR1 gene might alter the bioavailability and thus the effectiveness of losartan","This trial was conducted in the emergency services of Gazi University and Pamukkale University. The patient group was comprised of 50 individuals presenting with a hypertensive episode (patients under 60, \>140/90 mmHg, patients over 60, \>150/90 mmHg, according to the JNC8 guidelines) while under losartan treatment. The control group, by contrast, included 50 patients whose blood pressure was regulated while receiving losartan treatment and who were admitted to the ED for reasons other than hypertensive episode. The eligible patients matching the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study.

Within the scope of this research, we included hypertension patients over 18 who gave their informed consent for the study and received minimum 25 mg losartan daily for at least six weeks. 50 individuals admitted to the ED due to a hypertensive episode while under losartan treatment were assigned to the patient group, while 50 patients whose blood pressure was regulated while receiving losartan treatment and who were admitted to the ED for reasons other than hypertensive episode were included in the control group. Those who did not give their consent to participate and did not match the inclusion criteria were excluded from the scope of the study Prior to the trial, the participants were assessed based on the pre-defined patient selection criteria, and the non-eligible ones were excluded from the trial.

NCT00553722,Does Aldosterone Cause Hypertension by a Non-Renal Mechanism?,Does Aldosterone Cause Hypertension by a Non-Renal Mechanism?,"It is well known that Aldosterone (aldo) can cause hypertension (HBP). Since aldo is known to cause the kidney to retain sodium (Na) and Na retention is known to cause HBP, it has been thought that the mechanism by which aldo causes HBP is by Na retention. Recent studies have suggested that aldo has many effects in addition to its ability to cause the kidney to retain Na. To test the hypothesis that aldo can cause HBP in a manner which does not involve Na retention, we plan, in this protocol, to give Eplerenone, a specific aldo antagonist, to patients on dialysis who have HBP. A positive effect of Eplerenone to lower HBP in these patients would support this hypothesis.","Background Shortly after the structure of aldosterone (aldo) was determined (1) in 1952, its effect on the kidney to cause sodium (Na) retention and potassium (K) and hydrogen ion (H) excretion were characterized (2,3). Although the ability of aldo to effect many transporting epithelia is now well known, it is this effect on the kidney to retain sodium which is felt to play an important role in Na retention to cause edema and, in some settings, hypertension (HBP).

Aldo was shown by Edelman (4) to bind to a specific receptor and then be transported into the nucleus of aldo responsive cells and subsequently lead to the production of aldo-induced proteins. The first aldo receptor antagonist )ARA(, spironolactone, has been used clinically for over 30 years in the management of edema and in the past few years a new agent Eplerenone, which is structurally similar to spironolactone, but without the side effect of gynecomastia, has come into clinical use in the USA and in Israel.

Treatment of HBP is usually directed at the cause of the HBP if it is known, for example, removal of tumors releasing catecholamines and correcting renal artery stenosis. If HBP is due to primary aldosteronism, then surgical removal of the tumor, or use of an ARA is usually effective (5,6). When the cause of the HBP is not known, traditionally called essential hypertension, therapy today frequently involves drugs that interfere with the RAS (7), but until recently the addition of an ARA was not usually included. Recently studies by Epstein and others (8,9) have shown that the addition of an ARA to the drug management of what has been considered essential HPB can further reduce HBP by over 10 mmHg, thus suggesting that the addition of an ARA to the routine tools available to treat HBP is important. Although the mechanism by which this addition of an ARA lowers HBP is not clear, the obvious suggestion is that by blocking the effect of aldo on the kidney to reabsorb Na there is an increased excretion of Na which is responsible for the lowering of HBP.

In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), at the time they start dialysis HBP is common and has been attributed to volume overload or an active RAS (10). Early in the history of hemodialysis the potential for the RAS to be involved in causing HBP was unclear, but studies with saralasin (11,12), a competitive angiotensin II antagonist, clearly showed that in dialysis patients with elevated plasma renin levels the renin was involved in causing HBP by leading to the generation of angiotensin II. Although a number of other mechanisms apart from volume and angiotensin II have been considered, there is little evidence today that any, including aldo, play a regular role in causing HBP in the dialysis setting.

Because of the possibility that aldosterone may contribute to the HBP of patients on dialysis, independent of an effect on sodium excretion (since such patients excrete little urine), this protocol is designed to test this possibility by administering an ARA to patients on chronic dialysis with HBP. A positive result would strongly suggest that there is an effect to lower HBP independent of sodium excretion. Such a result would be indicative of a non-Na mechanism for ARA to lower HBP in dialysis patients, but would also suggest the possibility of ARA acting by a non-Na mechanism in lowering HBP in essential HBP.

Is hyperkalemia a concern in this protocol? Although there is evidence that aldo can facilitate potassium excretion, even in patients with renal failure (13) by increasing GI excretion, there have been several studies recently which demonstrate that spironolactone (14,15) or Eplerenone (16) can be given to renal failure/ dialysis patients without the development of hyperkalemia. Thus, it seems that these ARAs can be given to patients with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis, without hyperkalemia routinely developing. Nevertheless, in this protocol, plasma potassium will be regularly measured to minimize the development of hyperkalemia.

A very small study addressed this question using Spironolactone (14). Since it has been shown that Eplerenone does not cause gynecomastia in men, and many of our dialysis patients are men, we will use this drug, rather than Spironolactone, in this study.

Rational and Aims The role of aldo to cause HBP by a Na retaining mechanism is well described. Since recent studies suggest that aldo may have other mechanisms of action, this protocol will address the possibility that aldo can cause HBP by a non-Na retaining mechanism. This will be done by giving an ARA, Eplerenone, to patients with HBP on dialysis. In these patients the kidney plays no role in Na regulation. Thus, if BP falls with Eplerenone, these observations would strongly support the hypothesis than aldo can cause HBP by a non-Na retaining mechanism.

Methods We will select study participants from adult hemodialysis patients treated thrice weekly at Shaare Zedek Medical Center Dialysis Unit. Men and women will qualify for the study if they were on hemodialysis therapy for more than 3 months, have an average predialysis plasma potassium concentration less than 5.6 mEq/L at the time of enrollment and have nil or minimal urine output (\<500 mL/24 h). All participating women of childbearing age will have a negative pregnancy test result before entering into the study. Additional exclusion criteria will include a known allergy to Spironolactone or Eplerenone; any acute illness; hypotension, defined as a predialysis systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg; severe hypertension (predialysis systolic blood pressure \>180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure \>100 mm Hg); decompensated heart failure; inability to give informed consent; and noncompliance. The Institutional Review Board of Shaare Zedek Medical Center will be asked to give approval to the study protocol. All participants will give written-informed consent.

We plan on enrolling 27 patients in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study. At study start, participants will be administered either Eplerenone, 25 mg, or a placebo tablet orally twice daily for 4 weeks. This 4-week period will be followed by a 3-week washout period. After the washout period, patients will cross over in their treatment arms for 4 more weeks. Patients administered Eplerenone for the first 4 weeks will be given placebo for the last 4 weeks, and vice versa. All patients will serve as their own controls.

Participants will receive outpatient hemodialysis 3 times a week using B. Braun CE0123 machines (B. Braun, D-34212 Meisungen, Germany). All patients will use B. Braun polysulfone membranes. To control for the effects of volume on blood pressure and the RAS, we plan to keep target postdialysis weight (dry weight) constant for each patient during the study. Dialysate sodium concentrations will be held constant at 140 mEq/L for all patients, dialysate potassium concentrations will be maintained at 2 mEq/L thru the study. We do not plan to impose additional dietary potassium restrictions beyond the usual recommendations for patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis. We plan to make no changes to dialysate potassium concentrations or antihypertensive regimens. Because of a mandate not to alter the antihypertensive regimen, target weight, and dialysis potassium bath during the study, we will exclude patients with hypotension, severe hypertension, and hyperkalemia. To evaluate the effect of Eplerenone independent of its diuretic action, we plan to include only oliguric or anuric patients (urine output \<500 mL/24 h).

We plan to determine predialysis and postdialysis weights, interdialytic weight gains (IDWGs), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures for each patient by calculating an average of 3 measurements obtained during 1 week before the administration of any study medication (baseline), during each week of placebo and Eplerenone treatment, and during the last week of the washout period. At the beginning and end of each treatment period, we plan to measure predialysis and postdialysis plasma potassium and aldosterone levels, renin activity (PRA), and, on a nondialysis day, 24-hour urine excretion of sodium, potassium, and creatinine. We plan to monitor predialysis plasma potassium concentrations weekly in all subjects. Predialysis blood samples will be obtained after cannulation of the vascular access before the start of the dialysis session. We plan to obtain postdialysis blood samples from a predialyzer blood sample port at the end of the hemodialysis session after slowing the blood pump to 50 to 100 mL/min. Shaare Zedek Medical Center Laboratory will perform all laboratory tests.

Statistical Methods Results will be presented as mean ± SD. To compare clinical and laboratory parameters, Student t-test will be used for paired samples. Linear regression and correlation will be used to assess the relationship between 2 variables. Stepwise regression will be used to identify predictors of a single variable. P less than 0.05 will be used to define statistical significance.

NCT04254822,HVPG-Guided Therapy vs Carvedilol Plus Endotherapy for the Prevention of Esophageal Variceal Rebleeding in Cirrhotic Patients,Hepatic Vein Pressure Gradient(HVPG)-Guided Therapy vs Carvedilol Plus Endotherapy for the Prevention of Esophageal Variceal Rebleeding in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial,"Variceal bleeding is a major complication of cirrhosis, associated with a hospital mortality rate of 10%-20%. Surviving patients are at high risk for recurrent hemorrhage. For these reasons, management should be directed at its prevention. Endoscopic variceal band ligation (EBL) in combination with non-selective β-blocker (NSBB) therapy is the recommended first line therapy. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) is the most effective method to prevent rebleeding, however, it is burdened with increased hepatic encephalopathy and deterioration of liver function in patients with advanced cirrhosis. So TIPS placement forms an alternative if first line therapy fails.

Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is currently the best available method to evaluate the presence and severity of portal hypertension. Patients who experience a reduction in HVPG of ≥20% or to \<12mmHg in response to drug therapy are defined as 'responders'. The lowest rebleeding rates are observed in patients on secondary prophylaxis who are HVPG responders. A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that combination therapy is only marginally more effective than drug therapy. This suggests that pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of combination therapy. Adding EBL may not be the optimal approach to improve the outcome of HVPG nonresponders and HVPG non-responders are a special high-risk population that may benefit from a more aggressive approach, such as an early decision for TIPS. It recently was shown that TIPS placement within 72 hours after acute bleeding not only prevented recurrent bleeding but also improved survival. These raise the question of whether ligation together with NSBB should remain the first choice for elective secondary prophylaxis.

Therefore, the purpose of the study is to compare whether HVPG-guided therapy is superior to standard combination therapy for the prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.",,UNKNOWN,,2020-06-01,2023-12-31,2023-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,220,ESTIMATED
NCT00005722,Stroke Belt Initiative,,"For State Health Departments located in Stroke Belt states, to assess high risk target audiences' needs and identify opportunities for more effective delivery of medical and/or educational services to reduce the high rate of stroke mortality experienced in the southeastern United States.","BACKGROUND:

High blood pressure has long been established as the key risk factor for stroke, the third leading cause of death in the United States and a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease deaths. Cigarette smoking and obesity have also been found to be risk factors for stroke as well as heart disease.

Death rates from stroke differ by state. In 1980, eleven states had age-adjusted stroke mortality rates that were more than 10 percent higher than the United States average, 40.3 per 100,000. Ten of these eleven states (all except Indiana) were in the South, forming a ""Stroke Belt"". Florida's northern counties experienced higher stroke mortality rates than its southern counties, offering an opportunity for a comparative study.

In 1980, with few exceptions, each race/sex specific stroke death rate in the Stroke Belt states was more than 10 percent above the national average. Nonwhite men and women in the Stroke Belt had substantially higher rates than whites in the Stroke Belt and nonwhites elsewhere in the United States. However, whites in Stroke Belt states also had greater age-adjusted stroke death rates than did whites in other parts of the country.

In 1990, the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) issued a Request for Proposals for the Stroke Belt Initiative. State Health Departments located in states with age-adjusted stroke mortality rates in excess of 10 percent of the national average were encouraged to initiate projects that assessed high risk target audience needs and to identify opportunities for more effective delivery of medical and/or educational services to reduce the high rate of stroke mortality experienced in the southeastern United States. These states were Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. In addition, the State of Florida was of interest because of differences in county age-adjusted stroke mortality rates--northern counties in the state experienced mortality rates as high or higher than rates in the Stroke Belt states, whereas southern counties exhibited rates closer to the national average, representing an excellent opportunity for a comparative study.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Stroke Belt Initiative had two phases. In Phase I, the pilot phase, State Health Departments located in Stroke Belt states assessed high risk target audiences' needs and identified opportunities for more effective delivery of medical and/or educational services to reduce the high rate of stroke mortality experienced in the southeastern United States. This phase lasted for three years, from September 1990 through August 1993.

In the second phase, the State Health Departments used the methods and materials developed in the pilot phase to deliver health education interventions to reduce the overall risk of stroke.",COMPLETED,,1990-09,1996-09,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,0,

The study treatment called BAY3283142 helps to relax blood vessels. It is currently under development for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is a condition in which the kidneys' ability to work gradually decrease over time. During this study, participants will take either different doses of the study drug BAY3283142 as tablets by mouth or a placebo. A placebo looks like the study drug but does not have any medicine in it. At the start of this study, the study doctor will check the medical history and current medications of the participants. They will also perform a complete health check on all the participants. Researchers will collect blood and urine samples from the participants at different time points to assess the safety and effects of BAY3283142. Each treatment scheme will consist of three doses that are given in a consecutive manner. For the first 7 days, participants will receive a lower dose of BAY3283142 in each treatment scheme. The middle and the higher dose of each treatment scheme will be given for 14 days and 7 days respectively. Participants will not know which treatment (placebo or BAY3283142) they will be given, but the study doctor will know which group received which treatment. A participant can be in the study for 10 weeks. This study will be conducted on men or postmenopausal women participants with mild to moderate high blood pressure who may not directly benefit from treatment with BAY3283142. However, information collected in this study will serve as a basis for the development of BAY3283142 for the treatment of people with CKD. Participants may experience pain and discomfort when blood samples are taken.

NCT02157025,A More Engaging Visual Field Test to Increase Use and Reliability in Pediatrics,A More Engaging Visual Field Test to Increase Use and Reliability in Pediatrics,"The majority of young children do not think that visual field (VF) testing of peripheral vision is similar to a game; therefore, it is not surprising that they have difficulty maintaining attention during VF testing and thus the test reliability suffers as a consequence. Poor VF reliability has been a longstanding, major issue since it leads to an increased number of tests and/or longer duration of time needed to determine when there are true vision losses. Providers are less likely to obtain VF tests in children since the results are of doubtful value and challenging to interpret when they are inconsistent. Effectively this means that children with untreated, slowly progressive eye diseases may go undiagnosed and incur greater visual losses. The investigators aim to create a prototype device that the investigators hypothesize will make VF testing more engaging for young children, thus increasing their attention and consistency of their responses to the test stimuli, which in turn should improve VF reliability. The components include a microdisplay video screen (1.5"" diameter) as the fixation target (instead of the standard LED light) displaying video clips of popular cartoon characters, and audio clips of impersonated cartoon character voices presented by the test operator to provide instructional feedback based on the child's performance during testing. Improved VF reliability from the investigators intervention would translate to improved diagnosis and care for young childrens' peripheral vision loss through widespread implementation of the investigators innovative, affordable and readily adoptable system at eye care providers' offices.",,RECRUITING,,2015-02,2026-12,2026-04,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,20,ESTIMATED

NCT06804122,Exercise-based Rehabilitation in Patients with Pulmonary Artery Disease,"Effects of Exercise-based Rehabilitation on Exercise Capacity, Quality of Life and Physical Activity in Patients with Pulmonary Artery Disease","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe disease characterized by elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) due to the narrowing of small pulmonary arteries. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommend supervised exercise-based rehabilitation as part of the treatment of PAH patients alongside optimal medical therapy (Level of evidence A, Class of recommendation I).

Studies on exercise-based rehabilitation for PAH patients are limited, and most interventions have been conducted at least partially in hospital settings. Unlike more common cardiovascular diseases, there are no detailed international exercise guidelines tailored specifically for PAH patients.

This study aims to verify that a group-based outpatient rehabilitation protocol suitable for the Finnish healthcare system improves exercise capacity, quality of life, and physical activity of PAH patients and is safe for appropriately selected patients. Additionally, the study aims to determine whether PAH patients adhere to regular exercise training and whether physical activity increases in the long term.

The goal is to assess whether an outpatient rehabilitation protocol, designed for the Finnish healthcare system, can achieve similar results to those observed in previous international studies. The primary outcome measure is the change in the six-minute walking distance (6MWD) compared to the patient's baseline. Long-term 6MWD data are often available for patients. The 6MWD is the most commonly used primary outcome in randomized and controlled PAH drug trials, and improvements in this test have been the basis for drug approvals. An improvement of 33 meters in the 6MWD is considered clinically significant, and the goal is to achieve this change with group-based outpatient rehabilitation.

Secondary outcomes include changes in quality of life (SF-36), WHO functional class, NT-proBNP levels, echocardiographic parameters, ESC/ERS risk-stratification score (four-strata model), muscle strength, respiratory measures, balance, daily step count, and insomnia severity.","Effects of group form exercise-based outpatient rehabilitation to Exercise Capacity, Quality of Life and Physical Activity in pulmonary artery hypertension (PAHexercise)

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe and life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis, even with current medical treatments. In addition to medication, exercise rehabilitation has been shown to positively impact patients' functional capacity and quality of life. Following the diagnosis, patients often reduce their physical activity, experiencing hesitancy and uncertainty regarding safe exercise practices. However, the 2022 ESC/ERS international treatment guidelines recommend exercise rehabilitation for PAH patients with evidence level 1A. The strongest evidence for the benefits of rehabilitation comes from international multicenter studies, where rehabilitation has primarily occurred in hospital settings. There is no suitable or feasible guideline for outpatient-based exercise rehabilitation. However, studies indicate that exercise rehabilitation is safe for medically stable patients.

The aim of our research is to investigate and describe whether group-based outpatient exercise rehabilitation has an impact on the exercise capacity, quality of life, and physical activity of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additionally, we aim to develop an effective model for outpatient exercise rehabilitation for Finnish PAH patients. The rehabilitation will be supervised by experienced physiotherapists. Only patients in stable condition under effective medication will be included in the study, ensuring the safety of the rehabilitation. Furthermore, international safety standards, such as those related to oxygen saturation, heart rate, and hemoglobin levels, will be adhered to. Overexertion will be avoided. The rehabilitation sessions will take place in the facilities of the Tampere Heart Hospital, and a contingency plan has been developed to manage any adverse events.

Objectives, Primary, and Secondary Outcomes

The study aims to:

* Demonstrate the efficacy of a group-based outpatient rehabilitation program in improving the physical performance, quality of life, and physical activity of PAH patients.
* Assess long-term adherence to regular exercise training.
* Compare results to international standards to establish the program's suitability within the Finnish healthcare system.

Primary Outcome: Change in 6MWT results compared to baseline.

Secondary Outcomes:

* Change in Quality of life (SF-36).
* Change in WHO functional classification.
* Change in NT-proBNP biomarker levels.
* Changes in echocardiographic parameters.
* Change in the ESC risk classification score.
* Changes in muscle strength, respiratory parameters, balance, daily step count, and insomnia severity.

Research Methods

The study is a prospective, observational, non-controlled, quantitative study. It is a non-randomized case study focusing on a small group in a specific context. Quantitative methods will be used to analyze data, using participants' baseline and historical follow-up results as comparators.

Due to the small patient cohort, a formal power analysis is not feasible. However, the goal is to demonstrate that the chosen rehabilitation method achieves a median improvement in 6MWT results comparable to those observed in large, randomized multicenter trials.

Schedule of the Research

Participants (maximum 20, minimum 8) will be recruited between 2025 and 2030. PAH is a rare disease, with international studies including sample sizes ranging from 7 to 183 participants.

The target group comprises PAH patients under follow-up at the cardiology outpatient clinic of Tays Heart Hospital.

NCT02937922,Effect of Exercise on Endothelial Injury in Hypertensive Patients,"Effect of Aerobic Exercise, Resistance or Combined in Endothelial Injury in Hypertensive Patients","Introduction: Endothelial dysfunction precedes atherosclerosis being evidenced in patients with hypertension. Increasing physical activity levels and/or physical exercise are part of the recommendations of antihypertensive therapy. However, the effects of oscillations and/or increase the systemic blood pressure induced by exercise session on endothelial function has not been studied.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined exercise on endothelial injury levels in patients with hypertension.

Methodology: Hypertensive (n = 51) and healthy subjects (n = 30) (30-59 years old) will perform at random 40 minutes of aerobic exercise (50-60% of heart rate reserve) or 40 minutes of resistance exercise (4 x 12 repetitions of exercises for lower limbs, 60-70% of one repetition maximum and 60-90 second interval) or 40 minutes of combined exercise (20 minutes of resistance exercise and 20 minutes of aerobic exercise, in that order). Blood will be collected 10 minutes before, 10 and 60 minutes after intervention for the quantification of endothelial microparticles (MPE) circulating (induced endothelial lesion) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) circulating (endothelial recovery capacity) by flow cytometry. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be held before and after the intervention. Ultrasonography is used to measure the flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery 10 minutes before, 10, 30 and 60 minutes after the intervention.

Statistics: generalized estimating equation (GEE) for repeated measurements and Person correlation, being significant p \< 0.05.

It is expected to show results to ensure cardiovascular protection in patients with hypertension caused by different types of exercise and consequent endothelial injury and release induced regenerative factors. Knowledge of the magnitude of injury and endothelial recovery provided by different types of exercise can contribute scientifically to health professionals aimed at prescribing exercise with a vascular protective vision in patients with hypertension.",,COMPLETED,,2016-01,2020-01,2019-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,FACTORIAL,SINGLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,33,ACTUAL
NCT03217825,Antihypertensive Effect of Different Doses of Rostafuroxin in Comparison With Losartan,"Antihypertensive Effect of Different Doses of ROSTAFUROXIN in Comparison With Losartan, Assessed by Office and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring in a Hypertensive Population Selected According to a Specific Genetic Profile.","The principal aim of the study is to demonstrate that Rostafuroxin is able to induce a more pronounced reduction of arterial blood pressure respect to Losartan, in hypertensive patients carrying at least one of the pre-specified gene mutations. In previous studies has been demonstrated that these mutations are able to induce specific alterations inducing an increase of sodium (Na) reabsorption at renal tubular level and an increase of arterial blood pressure. Pilot studies have demonstrated that Rostafuroxin is able to reduce the impact of these alterations, and so directly reverse the increase in blood pressure.","About 30% of the world adult population is affected by hypertension in industrialised countries. Elevated arterial pressure is the major cause of cardiovascular mortality and international guidelines emphasise the benefits of reducing blood pressure. The current antihypertensive strategies may reduce by 20-30% the cardiovascular risk of hypertensive patients when this efficacy is measured in clinical trials in comparison with placebo. A precise world-wide estimation of this efficacy both in term of patient burden and healthcare costs is not available; however, a recent analysis suggests that the world-wide cost of hypertension associated cardiovascular complications is around 1,000 billions dollars. Therefore, effective improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension can provide the most significant contribution to the decrease of cardiovascular mortality and reduction of the world-wide costs associated to treatment of hypertension complications.

Most of clinical trials, performed with the aim to show a reduction of the systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients, show that reduction of systolic blood pressure is independent from the class of tested drugs as diuretics, β blockers, Ca channel blockers or inhibitors of RAS seem to have roughly the same efficacy. These findings have been used as an argument to support the notion that the antihypertensive therapy efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk depends on the magnitude of the blood pressure fall rather than on the mechanism of action of the drug. This view contrasts with the well established notion that the secondary prevention capacity in other cardiovascular diseases differs among these classes of drugs with minor difference on the prevention of heart failure or stroke between the Ca antagonist and the other classes of drugs.

Furthermore, the recent findings on genetic of hypertension taken together with the previous data on pathophysiology of hypertension and its cardiovascular complications are consistent with the notion that a variety of heterogeneous genetic-molecular mechanisms concur to develop the rather uniform clinical picture of primary hypertension. Drugs are small molecules that produce their effects by interacting with larger molecules (proteins) whose function or reactivity may vary from one patient to another because the variations within the gene encoding them. Therefore, it is logical to postulate that the consequence of this different interaction either in term of blood pressure reduction or cardiovascular risk prevention may vary from a patient to another according to the peculiar function of the proteins involved in a given patient.

Rostafuroxin was selected during a research program aimed to synthesizing and selecting new antihypertensive compounds able to interfere with abnormalities in Na tubular reabsorption due to humoral and/or genetic mechanisms leading to essential (or genetic) hypertension. Many studies performed on the Milan hypertensive strain of rats (MHS), bearing a primary renal alteration in the ability to excrete sodium and increased blood pressure levels, showed a clear capacity of Rostafuroxin to revert these alteration, reducing systemic blood pressure.

Rostafuroxin selectively interferes with the Na-K pump correcting its functional abnormalities without interfering with other receptors involved in blood pressure regulation or hormonal homeostasis. At nanomolar concentration, rostafuroxin reduces the Na-K pump hyperactivation induced in renal cell cultures by either incubation with nanomolar ouabain concentrations or cell transfection with the 'hypertensive' variant of adducin.

Similarly, less than 1 μg/kg os of rostafuroxin is able to completely normalize both blood pressure and the increased renal Na-K pump activity in rats made hypertensive by a chronic infusion of low-dose ouabain. The antihypertensive effect of rostafuroxin is long-lasting since it is still present 24 hours after oral administration. It is not associated with changes in heart rate. Moreover, the long-term antihypertensive activity of rostafuroxin is not associated with alterations of plasma potassium, RAAS, insulin resistance, plasma lipid profile and uricemia. These findings indicate that the normalization of renal sodium handling brought about by this compound is not accompanied by the typical side effects of diuretics, such as: hypokaliemia, increased plasma levels of renin, aldosterone, triglycerides and uric acid, or insulin resistance.

Increased levels of EO and the mutated adducin are both associated with the organ complications related to hypertension, namely cardiac hypertrophy and progression toward renal insufficiency. Cardiac and renal hypertrophy is induced in rats by chronic ouabain infusion. Rostafuroxin prevents the ouabain-induced organ hypertrophy.

Rostafuroxin has shown a high safety ratio in toxicological studies and was well tolerated in previous clinical trials.

Patients with mutated adducin and increased EO plasma levels share many functional, hormonal and biochemical characteristics with MHS rats, therefore Rostafuroxin could become a first choice treatment in such patients bearing specific gene mutations and presenting high arterial blood pressure levels.

Preliminary proof of concept studies have shown ability of Rostafuroxin to reduce arterial blood pressure levels in such a patients.",COMPLETED,,2015-12,2018-02-08,2018-02-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,240,ACTUAL

1. to compare the effects of nifedipine GITS and ramipril on blood pressure variability in subjects with elevated blood pressure variability.
2. to assess whether the degree of treatment-induced changes in blood pressure variability, is related to the degree of regression (or progression) of organ damage in heart, kidneys and carotid arteries.","Elevated blood pressure variability (BPV) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and organ damage in hypertensive subjects. An antihypertensive treatment able to reduce BPV independently of BP lowering effect might thus provide additional protection in terms of cardiovascular risk in subjects with elevated BPV, independently on its effect of BP itself. However, data on the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on BPV are limited and inconsistent. Some studies have suggested a possible usefulness of calcium antagonists in this setting. Based on the above considerations the investigators hypothesize that a calcium channel blocker nifedipine GITS, will provide a greater BPV lowering effect, when compared with ramipril, independently from the reduction in mean BP level. Based on the above considerations, the primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of nifedipine GITS and ramipril on different estimates of BPV (24 h BPV, home BPV, and visit-to-visit BPV) in subjects with elevated BPV.

Moreover, in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), we found that acute correction of this dyssynchrony by temporary pacing (prior to pulmonary endarterectomy, presently the therapy of choice for CTEPH) results in significant improvement in cardiac output. In this study, we aim to establish whether chronic pacing with the use of implanted pacemakers confers long-lasting improvements in cardiac output and functional class.

Objective: To study whether chronic pacing with implanted pacemakers confers long-lasting improvements in cardiac output and functional class in severely symptomatic CTEPH patients who are not eligible for pulmonary endarterectomy, or those in whom pulmonary endarterectomy has failed.

Study design: Chronic intervention study, double-blinded, randomized, cross-over.

Study population: Adult CTEPH patients who are not eligible for pulmonary endarterectomy, or those in whom pulmonary endarterectomy has failed.

Intervention (if applicable): chronic right ventricular resynchronization therapy (RVRT), i.e., chronic right atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular pacing with the use of implanted pacemakers.

In Malaysia, NCDs account for 67% of premature mortality, and over 70% of disease burden in 2014. In 2016, NCDs were responsible for 71% of the 57 million deaths globally. An estimated 78% of all NCD deaths and 85% of premature adult NCD deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. In Malaysia, NCDs contribute to 71% of premature deaths. According to the Malaysian Burden of Disease and Injury Study (2009-2014), cardiovascular and circulatory diseases contributed to 34.8% of deaths. Data from NHMS 2015 showed an increasing trend for diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia but a plateau trend for hypertension. The prevalence of diabetes was from 11.2% (2011) to 13.4% (2015), hypertension from 32.7% (2011) to 30.3% (2015) and hypercholesterolaemia from 35.1% (2011) to 47.7% (2015).

The burden of NCDs has increased substantially over the years. Information from the Global Burden of Disease Study suggests that the biggest contributor amongst the modifiable behavioural risk factors is unhealthy eating. The exposure to an unhealthy diet occurs throughout the lifespan of an individual and accumulates over his/her lifetime. With the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the high prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, it is unlikely that Malaysia will be able to achieve target 3.4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (of reducing premature mortality due to NCDs). At the current trajectory, it is also unlikely for Malaysia to reach the nine voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of NCDs.

There is an urgent need to reduce exposure to NCD risk factors amongst Malaysians. There are evidences that medical nutrition therapy using nutritional supplements are recommended to treat NCDs. Nutritional supplements contain biologically active ingredients associated with physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus . Natural nutraceuticals were a preferable treatment method that has been accepted by consumers and appeared to be generally safe . Among the nutritional supplements used in controlling chronic diseases is the utilisation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Fatty acids (FA) are hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl group at one end and a methyl group at the other. The carboxyl group is reactive and readily forms ester links with alcohol groups, for example, those on glycerol or cholesterol, in turn, forming acylglycerols (e.g.: triacylglycerols, phospholipids) and cholesterol esters. They have a variable-length carbon chain and can be categorised based on the degree of saturation of their carbon chains. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) possess the maximal number of hydrogen atoms, while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have one double bond. Fatty acids with double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain are referred to as unsaturated fatty acids; a fatty acid with 2 or more double bonds is called polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The number of carbon atoms in the chain is denoted by a shorthand nomenclature and the position of the first double bond relative to the methyl (called n) carbon. PUFA can be further subdivided based on the location of the first double bond relative to the methyl terminus of the chain. For example, omega-3 (Ω-3) and omega-6 (Ω-6) FAs are two of the most biologically significant PUFA classes and have their first double bond on either the third or sixth carbon from the chain terminus, respectively . Long-chain Ω-3 and Ω-6 PUFA are synthesised from the essential FAs (EFAs) alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), respectively. EFAs cannot be made by the human body and must be obtained through dietary sources. However, animals and humans have the capacity to metabolise EFAs to long-chain derivatives through multiple elongation and desaturation steps.

A high amount of ALA can be found in many nuts . Some Peruvian species that contain this compound in a high percentage is the Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia Volubilis L.). Sacha Inchi is a plant of the Euphorbiaceous family, which grows in the Amazonian forest. The plant, widely cultivated in Peru, has been a component of various native tribal groups of the region. The seeds of Sacha Inchi are of great interest because they contain approximately, on average, 48% oil and 27% proteins. Sacha Inchi seeds have a unique fatty acid composition containing a large amount of unsaturated fatty acids (about 85% polyunsaturation), comprised of approximately 51% linolenic acid (Ω-3) and 34% linoleic acid (Ω-6) . This Peruvian species has been classified as an edible oil with the highest proportion of unsaturated fatty acids7. The oil from Sacha Inchi also contains a high content of gamma- \& ∂-tocopherols, it is, despite its high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which in turns makes it comparably stable against oxidation. Several in vivo studies have proven that Sacha Inchi can be exquisitely digested. Traditionally, the oil has been used in the preparation of various meals, the seeds are roasted and the leaves are cooked \& consumed. SI seeds are also used as a traditional remedy in the Amazon region to treat rheumatic problems and aching muscles . Sacha Inchi oil (SIO) has also been identified as an important source of the healthy Ω-3 and Ω-6 linoleic acyl groups, which are beneficial in controlling cardiometabolic syndrome namely coronary heart disease and hypertension, showing a hypocholesterolaemic effect when used as food supplements.

Literature suggests that Ω-3 and Ω-6 must co-exist or taken in the ratio of 1:1, which is the closest during evolution of humans in order to be beneficial for human health. Common fish oil and nuts have the Ω-3 to Ω-6 variation of 5-13:1 and 1:4-16 respectively. Ω-6 or linoleic acid are not favourable to be ingested in such a tilted ratio as it increases low-density lipoprotein oxidation and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Clinical studies on high Ω-6/Ω-3 ratio found that when the ratio decreases, the platelet aggregation; the underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis also decreases. A lower Ω-6/Ω-3 ratio also has been found to decrease vascular endothelial growth factor. Too high amount of Ω-6 also inhibits eicosapentaenoic acid incorporation from dietary Ω-3 supplements in human subjects. Throughout a variety of nuts and fishes, Sacha Inchi oil has a 1:1.25 Ω-6 to Ω-3 ratio, approaching the closest of ideal ratio of 1:1. The ideal ratio as demonstrated, could be of relevance to both neurodevelopment and the prevention of neurodegeneration. A target of 1:1 to 2:1 has appeared to be consistent with studies on evolutionary aspects of diet, neurodevelopment, and genetics.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are the most common form of NCDs in Malaysia. Prescription of standard and long term medical regimen has long been implemented in managing the illnesses. There is a need to search for some potential complementary medicine to combat 3Hs. The use of Sacha Inchi oil as part of the dietary regimen, or alternative medicine to alleviate the disease progression is the novel research focus among the scientific communities. With the aforementioned, this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded human clinical trial is aimed to determine the efficacy of 12 weeks supplementation of Sacha Inchi oil, a natural blend of polyunsaturated fatty acids among the 3Hs patients. Secondary outcomes include the assessment of vascular implication biomarkers, inflammatory markers, nutritional status, quality of life, mental health, safety and tolerability.",COMPLETED,,2021-05-01,2022-12-31,2022-10-27,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,54,ACTUAL

This leads to a gradual loss of the visual field, and in the final stage to blindness. High intraocular pressure is considered to be the main risk factor for glaucomatous neuropathy. In the treatment we use pharmacological therapies and surgical treatment. The trabeculectomy has been the golden standard for the treatment of glaucoma for many years. This procedure consisting in the creation of a filtering bleb, which allows drainage of aqueous humor from within the eye to underneath the conjunctiva where it is absorbed. in addition to the surgery, anti-proliferative substances play a significant role in suppressing the physiological healing process. Bleb insufficiency observed in the postoperative period results to a large extent from progressive scarring of the follicle, which is responsible for excessive fibroblast proliferation and subconjunctival fibrosis.

Mitomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic produced by Streptomyces caespitosus. It is one of the bi- or tri-functional alkylating agents causing cross-linking of DNA and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Its properties cause that mitomycin is now a popular medicine used to support trabeculectomy, with proven effectiveness of inhibiting the unwanted healing process of the fistula, and thus extend its period of its proper functioning.

Aflibercept is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Its properties cause inhibition of the pathological process of formation of new vessels and their excessive permeability, as well as reduction of leukocyte infiltration and inflammation.

Valsartan (Diovan), an FDA approved angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (blocker) clinically indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension is known to inhibit platelet activity in both an in vitro and ex vivo setting. Aliskiren (Tekturna) is a recently FDA-approved potent direct renin inhibitor which is also an effective anti-hypertensive agent in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and which, in vitro, modulates antithrombin III in plasma. Therefore, in addition to being clinically approved anti-hypertensive medications, combining these two agents will potentially target both primary hemostasis (platelets) and anticoagulant (antithrombin-III is a cornerstone substrate for heparin) properties to exert their anti-thrombotic efficacy simultaneously. This combination strategy may not only improve hypertension management, but also improve vascular outcomes in high-risk diabetic population via favorable effects on anti-thrombotic activity. Importantly, there have been no significant additional safety concerns of using the combination of aliskiren and valsartan. The investigators hypothesis is that valsartan 160 mg/daily in combination with aliskiren 150-300 mg/daily for 4 weeks will favorably affect blood levels of platelet/coagulation/fibrinolytic biomarkers (ie, diminish platelet activity, and enhance antithrombin III potency) when compared with monotherapy with aliskiren 150mg/daily in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Objectives:

There are 2 objectives in the index study. • The primary objective is to determine how therapy with valsartan (160mg/daily) in combination with aliskiren (150-300mg/daily) over four weeks affects platelet/coagulation/fibrinolytic biomarkers in recently diagnosed hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, this is an exploratory study, our current knowledge is based on in vitro and ex vivo evidence for valsartan, but only on in vitro aliskiren data. There are no data on antithrombotic biomarkers currently available for the combination therapy.

The secondary objective is:

• To define whether combination therapy is superior over monotherapy with aliskiren with regard to the improvement of hemostatic biomarkers (platelet aggregation, expression of GP IIb/IIIa, and plasma levels of antithrombin-III).

Study Design:

This is a randomized 1:1, two arm, single-blind, single-site, parallel group, post-marketing comparison study of the effects on antithrombotic biomarkers of aliskiren 150-300mg/day alone vs combined treatment with aliskiren 150-300mg/day plus valsartan 160mg/day over a four week primary treatment period. An optional four week extension phase may be offered pending assessment of the antithrombotic biomarker assays at week four.

Population:

Two groups (25 patients each), for a total of 50, recently diagnosed hypertensive patients with previously diagnosed mild to moderate type 2 diabetes will constitute the proposed study population. The diagnosis of diabetes will be made based on the American Diabetes Association criteria, such as random plasma glucose \>200 mg/dL with or without symptoms of hyperglycemia (polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia) and weight loss, or fasting plasma glucose \> 126 mg/dL, to be determined at least twice. Patients will qualify if they are insulin-free, treated with an oral antiglycemic agent,(metformin only) and/or managed on diet alone for no less than 30 days and have adequate glucose control at the time of their Screening Visit.",UNKNOWN,,2010-03,2011-03,2010-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,50,ESTIMATED

To prevent and control seizures, there is no doubt that the magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the ideal drug. However, there are still questions regarding its use and dose. The scheme and the optimal time of administration remain to be elucidated. The objective of this trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate in the maintenance phase 1g / h versus 2 g / h to prevent eclampsia in pregnant and postpartum women with severe preeclampsia (pure or superimposed).","Hypertensive disorders are frequent during the course of pregnancy-puerperal cycle and an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, fetal and perinatal. The high frequency of maternal death can be explained by the presence of numerous complications such as eclampsia. Eclampsia is an obstetric emergency capable of prophylaxis. To prevent and control seizures, there is no doubt that the magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the ideal drug. However, there are still questions regarding its use and dose. The scheme and the optimal time of administration remain to be elucidated. Currently, allows the use of either 1 g / h to 2 g / h of magnesium sulphate during the maintenance phase to prevent eclamptic convulsions. However, there is no report in the literature of randomized controlled trials comparing different doses of magnesium sulfate in the maintenance phase to prevent eclampsia.

The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate in the maintenance phase 1g / h versus 2 g / h to prevent eclampsia in pregnant and postpartum women with severe preeclampsia (pure or superimposed).There will be a trial randomized and triple blind in the Integrative Medicine Institute Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP) from March 2015 to April 2017, and will be included 2000 women randomized into two groups: MgSO4 maintenance dose of 1 g / h or 2 g / h. Patients who had eclampsia before loading dose, with use of other medications or illicit drugs that may interfere with maternal hemodynamics or with contraindications to the use of magnesium sulfate will be excluded.

They often develop high blood pressure. We are not sure what drug is best to treat the high blood pressure. This study will give the patients guanfacine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for 6 weeks after 2 weeks of placebo. The blood pressure response will be evaluated by 24 hour monitoring.,"This is a blinded crossover study measuring the antihypertensive efficacy of guanfacine vs HCTZ in up to 34 subjects. Subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \> 10 and hypertension can enter the study. Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) \> 140 or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \> 90 on the average of three seated blood pressure measurements or a history of medical therapy for hypertension. Subjects who have tried and abandoned continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for sleep apnea are eligible for this study. All others will be advised that CPAP is preferred treatment for sleep apnea and are eligible only if they decline CPAP or use it for too short a time at night to be effective.

Then patients will have their antihypertensive drugs tapered off and receive single blind placebo for two weeks. After that, all subjects receive guanfacine or HCTZ for six weeks with a full evaluation at that time. Subjects are crossed over to HCTZ 12.5 mg for 2 weeks followed by HCTZ 25 mg for 4 more weeks Guanfacine 1mg will be taken daily at bedtime for 2 weeks and then as a dose of 2 mg for the remaining 4 weeks. Subjects will receive a telephone call at the time of increased dosage as a reminder. Blood, urine and 24-hour blood pressure measurements, hemodynamic measurements, questionnaires and drug accountability are measured in the same manner toward at the the end of placebo and each drug treatment. The entire study will take 14 weeks, although each study period may be lengthened by one week if necessary for the convenience of the subject's personal schedule.

Patients will provide blood pressure readings from their home monitor or in clinic and will not have the dose increased if they have systolic blood pressure below 105 mm Hg or side effects, such as excessive somnolence, drowsiness, or depression, suggesting that an increased dose might worsen side effects

At the end of each treatment period, subjects will undergo noninvasive hemodynamic testing. Ultrasound will be used to measure aortic diameter and blood velocity in the ascending aorta in order to better estimate cardiac output. Then, finger plethysmography will be used to acquire beat-to-beat finger blood pressure and pulse rate. Beat-to-beat derived hemodynamic variables will be calculated by a model flow algorithm (e.g. brachial artery flow, stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection time, blood pressure rate of change, peripheral resistance). Applanation tonometry will be used to obtain pulse wave velocity and central arterial pressure. ECG will be recorded with standard ECG leads to determine heart rate variability in both time and frequency domains. Spontaneous baroreflex will be determined from beat-to-beat changes in blood pressure and pulse pressure interval. Forearm reactive hyperemia will be used to quantify endothelial dysfunction during 4 minutes of post-ischemic change. Subjects will then complete an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire (ESS) and a Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) to find whether they are drowsy in the daytime and if they feel that they are compromised by not having adequate rest. Any adverse event will be recorded. They are asked about any concurrent medication over the prior period, including prescription medication, over the counter medication, and caffeine intake. Medication compliance is evaluated by pill count. Those who fail to return their pill bottle are requested to bring it in. Finally, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) will be attached to automatically collect blood pressure and heart rate values every 15 minutes during the wake period and every 30 minutes during the sleep period.",COMPLETED,,2015-01,2016-08,2016-06,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,41,ACTUAL

Interestingly, it has been recently revealed that, in addition to the cardiovascular dysfunction associated with high sodium intake-induced hypertension, individuals who have unaltered blood pressure after chronic high sodium intake, termed salt resistant, report similar reductions in cardiovascular function when compared to salt sensitive individuals. While the extent to which this high sodium intake negatively alters cardiovascular structure as well as function is currently being explored, little is known about how high sodium intake impacts vascular function and blood flow regulation during exercise. Therefore, this study will determine if alterations in sodium intake alter peripheral vascular function and exercise tolerance in young individuals. The investigators hypothesize that increases in sodium intake will reduce exercise-induced arterial dilation in response to shear and result in exercise intolerance, via impaired functional sympatholysis, at moderate-to-high exercise workloads. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that these changes in blood flow regulation and exercise tolerance in young individuals will be reversed following antioxidant supplementation, implicating the role of oxidative stress in this dysfunction.",COMPLETED,,2018-05-15,2021-11-05,2021-11-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,34,ACTUAL

NCT00006322,Birth Weight Effect on Blood Pressure in Late Childhood,,To investigate the relationship of birth weight and childhood blood pressure.,"BACKGROUND:

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. On the basis of an interplay of genetic and environmental factors, these diseases appear to be rooted in childhood. Recent reports implicate the intrauterine nutritional environment regulating fetal growth as a determinant of adult cardiovascular disease. According to this concept, impaired fetal growth, with consequent lower birth weight, results in alteration in organ structure and subsequent functional impairment in later life. Higher blood pressure (BP) has been suggested as the possible link between compromised intrauterine growth and the long-term risk for cardiovascular disease. Despite the many reports which appear to support the low birth weight - high BP hypothesis, this concept is in conflict with the body of data on the association of BP with body size in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood which consistently demonstrates a direct relationship between body weight and BP.

The results of this prospective study contributed an objective body of data to this important issue. If birth measures reflecting intrauterine exposure do contribute significantly to BP in later childhood, then studies focused on the mechanisms regulating this risk are justified. Alternatively, if post-natal/childhood parameters are the major determinants of later BP, then efforts should focus on effective preventive strategies in childhood, such as obesity.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

To examine the low birth weight - high blood pressure concept, the investigators conducted a prospective study on a cohort of children who were well characterized at birth. In 1988, data on weight, length, BP, gestation and maternal health were obtained on 1,160 newborn cases representing a range of birth weight and gestational age. They re-examined these children at age 11-13 years to test the overall hypothesis that birth weight, as well as other newborn measures of intrauterine growth, did not correlate with BP at age 11-13 years. The aims of the project were to: 1) determine if birth weight contributed to BP and/or body size in childhood; 2) determine if the duration of intrauterine growth in terms of gestational age contributed to BP and body size; 3) determine if newborn ponderal index, a measure of relative fetal growth, contributed to BP and body size; and 4) determine the relative contribution of newborn measures of birth weight, gestational age, BP, ponderal index, and maternal health to BP and body size in late childhood.

Strategies for the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy have focused on countering vasoconstriction (pre-hydration, fenoldopam, and theophylline), enhancing flow through the nephron (diuretics), or protection against oxygen-free-radical injury (urinary alkalinization and N-acetylcysteine).

Among all prophylactic measures that have been proposed, adequate preprocedural and postprocedural hydration has demonstrated effectiveness in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. Thus, it remains the most frequently applied measure in clinical practice.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repetitive closure of upper airways leading to apnoea (complete airflow cessation) or hypopnoea (airflow limitation \> 50%+ blood oxygen desaturation \> 4%). It is considered to be an important risk factor for arterial hypertension. In these patients is highly prevalent nocturnal hypertension (NH) and also masked hypertension (MH). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered to be a gold standard for the diagnosis of NH and MH. Results of ABPM are compared with office blood pressure measurement which could be falsely elevated in some patients (white coat effect). For this reason, automatic office blood pressure measurement was developed. Nowadays some devices like BpTRU were developed. This was validated on some patient groups but robust data for patients with obstructive sleep apnoea are missing.

NCT00054925,Weight Loss Maintenance (WLM),Weight Loss Maintenance (WLM),To determine the effectiveness of continuous patient contact on weight loss maintenance.,"BACKGROUND:

Overweight/obesity is the second leading cause of death in the US, and is growing in prevalence at an alarming rate. Control of overweight/obesity is increasingly recognized as a high national priority because of its contribution to cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors and ultimately to CVD itself. The short-term success of behavioral interventions for weight loss has been repeatedly documented. Unfortunately, because weight re-gain is extremely common, a disappointingly, small proportion of individuals achieve long-term weight control. Of the factors that are associated with sustained weight loss, one of the most important is continued intervention with frequent contacts.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study is a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial \[Weight Loss Maintenance Trial (MAINTENANCE)\] to determine the effects of two innovative behavioral interventions, each designed to maintain frequent contacts, compared to a usual care control group. Overweight and obese individuals (60% women, 40% African Americans) who are taking medication for hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes will enter a 6-month, weight loss program. Those 800 individuals who lose at least 4 kg (approximately 9 pounds) will then be randomized into one of three groups: a Personal Contact (PC) Intervention that provides monthly personal contacts with a trained interventionist, primarily via telephone; an Interactive Technology (IT) Intervention that provides frequent contacts through a state-of-the-art interactive web-based program supplemented by other communication technologies; or Usual Care (UC). The primary outcome will be weight change from the end of the initial weight loss program to the end of the 30-month weight maintenance intervention period. Other outcomes will include weight change in subgroups, prevalence of CVD risk factors, measures of behavior change, and cost of implementation. For each outcome, the Personal Contact and Interactive Technology interventions will be compared to Usual Care and, if different from Usual Care, to each other. To successfully combat the obesity epidemic, clinicians and health care systems must have options that are effective and feasible and that can be provided to large numbers of individuals.

NCT02376725,Comparing Phaco/IOL Versus Phaco/IOL + Goniosynechialysis in Subjects With PACG,A Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Phacoemulsification and Goniosynechialysis With Phacoemulsification Alone in the Management of Primary Angle Closure,The purpose of this study is to determine if phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implant (phaco/IOL) alone or combined with goniosynechialysis is better at controlling intraocular pressure in subjects with primary angle closure.,"Study Background

Glaucoma is the worlds' leading cause of irreversible blindness with nearly 7 million bilaterally blind due to the disease, by some estimates, and as such, represents a disease with significant associated morbidity. Furthermore, as glaucoma is primarily a disease of old age, as the number of elderly people in the world continues to rise, the number of people with glaucoma blindness is likely to have increasing economic burden and public health costs.

Primary glaucoma is classified into 2 types, Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG). Classification depends on configuration of the anterior chamber drainage angle, specifically if it is open or if it shows evidence of closure. The proportions of people with POAG and PACG are approximately equal, with the latter disease more common in Asians and women. Although the result of both diseases is progressive cupping of the optic disc with corresponding visual fields loss, the mechanism by which this occurs is thought to be quite different in the two diseases. In POAG the mechanism is still to be established but in PACG it is thought that apposition of the peripheral iris to the drainage angle results in damage to the trabecular meshwork (TM) and the formation of peripheral anterior synaechiae (PAS) which act as a mechanical obstruction of aqueous outflow via the trabecular meshwork. This in turn results in raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and subsequent optic nerve damage. Apposition can occur in anatomically predisposed eyes, although a physiological dynamic element is likely to be involved also. Areas of the TM not obstructed by PAS are likely to retain some function, although it is not clear if this is at the same level as in normal subjects. The functioning of the TM posterior to the areas of PAS has also yet to be established and it is hope that this study will help to elucidate this matter.

Conventional initial management of PACG is to perform laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) to allow flow of aqueous from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber through the iatrogenically created iridotomy. This has two benefits - in those subjects where pupillary-block is thought to be the mechanism for angle closure, it can reduce the risks of an acute rise in IOP occurring (acute angle closure). In other subjects with PAC, LPI has been shown to increase the drainage angle and this has led to lowering of the IOP in some subjects. However, in a retrospective review of 65 subjects with PACG who had had LPI, after 5 years follow-up the vast majority required further interventions (medications and/or surgery) to lower the IOP. Furthermore, PAS formation has been show to still occur in the presence of a patent PI. Clearly, the current conventional management strategy for PAC/PACG is inadequate and likely to lead to further ocular morbidity.

The poor results of LPI in the long-term for subjects with PACG in terms of IOP control has led many clinicians to study the effect of cataract surgery on IOP control in these patients. It was thought that removing the lens would increase anterior chamber depth and increase the drainage angle and hence increase outflow. Cataract surgery does indeed seem to open the drainage angle and its effects on IOP control have been promising. However, opening of the drainage angle may be limited in subjects with significant PAS. This could compromise the IOP lowering effect of cataract surgery in this group of patients. In such cases, cataract surgery with mechanical breaking of PAS (i.e. goniosynechialysis) might lower IOP to a greater extent than cataract surgery alone. Phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + Goniosynechialysis (PEI-GSL) has been carried out in several published studies, with all studies reporting a reduction in post-operative IOP compared to pre-operative. The main complications associated with PEI-GSL are excessive post-operative anterior chamber fibrinous reaction and anterior chamber bleeding. Theoretically, excessive pressure to break PAS could also cause iridodialysis or cyclodialysis, with resultant ocular hypotony. In an effort to reduce these complication risks, Varma and Fraser described phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + viscogonioplasty (PEI-VGP) in which a viscoelastic is used to break PAS in a non-iris contact method, rather than using an instrument to push the iris back. The authors proposed that this procedure would reduce the complications of PEI-GSL but still open the angle sufficiently. It is not clear however, if PEI-VGP would provide sufficient force to open areas of PAS and therefore be as efficacious as PEI-GSL in lowering IOP. Furthermore, there is no evidence that either PEI-GSL or PEI-VGP are superior to phacoemulsification + intraocular lens (PEI) alone in reducing IOP. Most surgeons will perform cataract surgery in patients with PAC/PACG and uncontrolled IOP. By adding the relatively simple step of goniosynechialysis during the surgical procedure, it has been proposed that this will result in further IOP lowering and hence less risk of glaucoma development/progression. This has yet to be proven.

An alternative treatment modality in subjects with PAC/PACG, visually significant cataract and high IOP, would be to perform phaco-trabeculectomy. Two recent randomized controlled trials published by Tham and co-workers, compared PEI versus phaco-IOL-trabeculectomy in subjects with medically controlled and medically uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma. For the medically controlled group, there was no clinically significant difference in IOP lowering effect between the two surgical modalities. For the medically uncontrolled group, both modalities reduced IOP but the phaco-IOL-trabeculectomy group had a significantly lower IOP. However, the phaco-IOL-trabeculectomy group in both studies had a significantly higher complication rate than did the PEI group. Furthermore, only 4/27 (14.8%) of eyes in the PEI group (in the medically uncontrolled IOP study) required subsequent trabeculectomy to control IOP over the 2 years follow up period. In all these 4 cases, trabeculectomy was carried out successfully. Extrapolating from these data it would appear that although phaco-trabeculectomy does lower IOP more than PEI in patients with medically uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma, many of these patients would not require 2 combined simultaneous procedures. Furthermore, trabeculectomy surgery has significant complication rates, even many years after the surgery is performed. Performing either PEI, or PEI-GSL (with or without viscoelastic assistance) would likely result in a significant reduction in IOP and still leave open the option of trabeculectomy (or glaucoma drainage device surgery) later on as the conjunctiva and sclera would be untouched. This multicentre study is designed to determine which of these 2 surgical options would superior in terms of efficacy and complications.

There have been no randomized controlled trials comparing PEI versus PEI-GSL (or PEI-VGP). There have been several case series and these will be summarized below.

Effect of phacoemulsification + intraocular lens on intraocular pressure in subjects with primary angle closure In patients with PAC or PACG, there is considerable evidence that PEI lowers IOP. Hayashi and coworkers, in a prospective study of 77 eyes of 77 consecutive patient with PACG found that IOP decreased significantly from baseline by an average of 6.1 ± 3.9 mmHg at 1 year follow up.5 Tham and co-workers showed an even more considerable decrease in IOP from a pre-operative mean of 24.4 mmHg to a mean of 15.4 mmHg at 15 months in a cohort of 27 patients with medically uncontrolled PACG.13 The same group examined the effect of PEI in a cohort of 35 eyes with medically controlled PACG.14 Pooling the results from both studies, PEI significantly reduced IOP from a pre-operative mean of 20.4 ± 5.8 mmHg to a mean of 14.6 ± 2.9 mmHg at 1 year, irrespective of pre-operative IOP control.

Effect of phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + goniosynechialysis on intraocular pressure in subjects with primary angle closure The largest case series on this topic, and the only prospective study performed on PEI-GSL was that performed by Teekhasaenee and coworkers. Fifty-two eyes of 48 patients (from Thailand) with PACG all underwent laser peripheral iridotomy but continued to have raised IOP defined as IOP \>21 mmHg. Subjects underwent PEI-GSL and IOP decreased from a pre-operative mean of 29.7 ± 7.9 mmHg to 13.2 ± 2.9 mmHg at final examination (mean follow up 20.8 ± 15.5 months, range 5-76 months). This is a mean decrease of 16.5 mmHg.

There are 2 studies on the effect of PEI-VGP on IOP control, both retrospective case series. In the first, a consecutive series of 15 eyes of patients with refractory PACG, PEI-VGP reduced IOP significantly from 27.4 mmHg (on medication) to 14.1 mmHg (off all medication in 14/15 eyes), at 6 months.13 This represents a decrease of 13.3 mmHg. A subsequent study of 11 patients (11 eyes) on subjects with PACG (all of whom had refractory control despite patent peripheral iridotomy) showed a decrease in IOP from 39.4 mmHg pre-operatively to a mean of 13.4 mmHg after PEI-VGP at 7.8 months follow up.

Effect of phacoemulsification + intraocular lens alone or phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + goniosynechialysis on angle opening in subjects with primary angle closure

There are several studies which have shown that the drainage angle opens significantly after PEI in subjects with PAC/G.17;18 Only one paper described the effects of PEI on extent of peripheral anterior synaechiae. This showed that in subjects with PACG and PAS, there was a significant reduction in the extent of PAS after PEI, by approximately 25%.8 Most studies of PEI-GSL also describe opening of the drainage angle in subjects with PAC/G. Several studies also describe reduction in extent of PAS, including complete elimination of PAS.

The population to be studied will be all patients attending Singapore national Eye Centre (SNEC), Tan Tock Sen Hospital (TTSH), National University Hospital Singapore (NUHS), Vietnam National Institute of Ophthalmology, Thailand Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University and Hongkong, Queen Mary Hospital

This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Singapore Good Clinical Practice (SGCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).

Study Objectives and Purpose

To evaluate and compare the effect of two different surgical interventions in patients with primary angle-closure (with or without glaucoma), high intraocular pressure, and cataract.

These interventions are:

1. phacoemulsification + intraocular lens (PEI)
2. phacoemulsification + intraocular lens + goniosynechialysis (PEI-GSL).

Study Design

Experimental design This is prospective, longitudinal multicentre randomized control trial. The study sites will be SNEC, TTSH, NUHS, Vietnam National Institute of Ophthalmology, Thailand Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University and Hongkong, Queen Mary Hospital All subjects will undergo baseline and subsequent follow-up and evaluation in a standardized manner. Those who complete the informed consent process will be randomized to undergo either treatment with PEI or PEI-GSL. Subjects will then be followed-up for 12 months.

Study hypothesis We hypothesize that, compared to PEI, PEI-GSL will result in significantly lower IOP reduction both in the short and long term, with a reduction in amount of PAS, a wider drainage angle and a similar complication rate as PEI.

Patient Selection All subjects attending the glaucoma clinic at SNEC, TTSH, NUHS, Vietnam National Institute of Ophthalmology,Thailand Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University and Hongkong, Queen Mary Hospital will be eligible to be included in the study if they fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below).

Once these criteria are fulfilled, subjects will be enrolled and divided into 2 groups using a random number generator. Group 1 will undergo PEI alone and Group 2 will undergo PEI-GSL.

Randomization and masking Block randomization method is used for randomization in this study. A pre-randomized list is generated according to Singapore Eye Research Institute's (SERI) standard operating procedure for randomization process by the clinic director and delegated stand-in. Following consent the study coordinator will contact the study centre (SERI) to obtain the randomization for each enrolled patient. Enrolled patient will be randomized to undergo either treatment with PEI or PEI-GSL. Randomization will be of patients and not eyes i.e. if two eyes of the same patient are eligible they will undergo the same intervention as allocated.

The investigator will be masked to the IOP measurement. Two individuals (an operator and a reader) will perform the IOP measurement. The operator operating the slit lamp and instrument dial will not be aware of the readings while the reader will read and record the results.

Surgical technique Anaesthetic will be general or peribulbar (approximately 3ml volume of 50/50 mix of 2% lignocaine and Marcaine with hyaluronidase). A superior or temporal clear corneal incision will be performed followed by creation of a paracentesis, injection of 3% sodium hyaluronate, 4% chondroitin sulfate (Viscoat, Alcon laboratories) and capsulorhexis. Hydrodissection is then performed using balanced salt solution and the lens is removed using phacoemulsification of the lens nucleus and aspiration (automated or manual) of cortical lens matter. After further injection of Viscoat, an acrylic injectable intraocular lens will be inserted into the capsular bag, its power having been determined pre-operatively based on biometric measurements. The Viscoat will then be removed (automated or manual), in the case of subjects undergoing PEI.

For those subjects PEI-GSL, the goniosynechialysis will be performed after partially filling the anterior segment with Sodium Hyaluronate 14mg/ml (""Healon GV"", Advanced Medical Optics (AMO), California, USA). Using a goniolens (with coupling agent) to visualize those areas of PAS (defined pre-operatively), the viscoelastic will be used to break areas of PAS wherever possible, without touching the TM or iris. In cases where the viscoelastic is unable to break PAS, an iris repositor will be used to gently break the PAS in the areas where it exists. After this is performed, the surgery will continue as above, with removal of any remaining viscoelastic by automated or manual irrigation and aspiration.

Surgeries will be performed by senior ophthalmic surgeons. Any intraoperative complications (such as posterior capsular rupture, hyphaema, iris damage) will be recorded.",COMPLETED,,2011-06,2015-02,2015-02,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,80,ACTUAL

NCT00979225,Clinical Decision Support for Medication Management and Adherence,Improving Quality Through Decision Support for Evidence-Based Pharmacotherapy,"This three-year, grant funded project will be conducted by the Division of Clinical Informatics in the Department of Community and Family Medicine at Duke University Medical Center. The project seeks to improve care quality and safety in an ambulatory care setting through clinical decision support for evidence-based (EB) pharmacotherapy delivered as point-of-care reports to clinic-based practitioners and as population health-based alerts to care managers.

This project will build upon a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE) network created to connect providers serving 37,000 Medicaid beneficiaries from both rural and urban settings in a 5 county region in the Northern Piedmont of North Carolina. This network includes 16 private practices, 3 federally qualified health centers, 5 rural health centers, 3 urgent care facilities, 10 government agencies, 5 hospitals, and 2 cross-disciplinary care management teams.

The proposed information system will be based on an emerging standard for decision support and will utilize routinely available claims and scheduling data in order to serve as a replicable model for broader use of decision support for medication management. Increased availability and use of decision support tools for medication management can be expected to reduce medication errors, improve health care quality at an acceptable cost, and augment disease management for patients and populations.","The study will be conducted in accordance with the following four specific aims:

Aim 1: Expand the functionality of an existing decision support system in use within a regional HIE network to incorporate EB pharmacotherapy guidelines and to promote medication adherence. Primary care clinicians will receive EB pharmacotherapy suggestions and a patient-specific summary of prescription claims data delivered to the point-of-care via fax. Care managers will receive alerts delivered via email to encourage patients to arrange follow-up clinic appointments because of possible medication non-adherence.

Aim 2: Implement and evaluate the impact of the two interventions on adherence to EB pharmacotherapy recommendations among Medicaid patients with high priority conditions as designated by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in ambulatory care settings through a three-arm randomized controlled trial.

Aim 3: Compare resource utilization and assess the economic attractiveness (cost-savings or cost-effectiveness) of the interventions to promote medication adherence and EB pharmacotherapy.

Aim 4: Disseminate information regarding the development and impact of the interventions through Web teleconferences, professional meetings, educational lectures, and peer review journals.",COMPLETED,,2009-09,2012-03,2011-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,5000,ACTUAL
NCT06050525,Incidence of Acute Kidney Injury and Risk Factors in Newborns With Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia,Incidence of Acute Kidney Injury and Risk Factors in Newborns With Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia,The main aim of this project is to elucidate the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia during stay in the Pediatric intensive care unit. (PICU). This patient group often presents with severe circulatory and respiratory dysfunction requiring intensive care treatment. Characterization of risk factors to AKI will also be performed.,"There is an overwhelming number of studies showing that complication with acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients, including children and newborns results in increased morbidity and mortality. The more severe AKI, the higher risk of bad outcome. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the incidence of AKI is approximately 30 %, even higher in full-term babies (36 %).

Newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) often present with severe cardio-respiratory dysfunction, often complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) requiring mechanical ventilation and vasoactive/inotropic drugs, especially during the first week in the intensive care. Some of these patients deteriorates and cannot maintain vital parameters despite conventional treatment and will therefore require extra corporeal membrane oxygenation). During the ICU-stay, the patients are subjected to several risk factors for developing AKI. Among physiological risk factors, PPHN, low oxygenation and blood pressure may result in renal dysfunction. Iatrogenic factors include the need for nephrotoxic drugs, not least antibiotics (Vancomycin, Gentamycin) and antimycotics. In addition, hyperchloremia may contribute to the development of AKI, since impaired renal blood flow is associated with hyperchloremia. The AKI incidence and its risk factors in CDH patients is not well studied.

The objectives of this well characterized retrospective cohort study is to establish AKI incidence in critically ill CDH-patients and investigate possible associations between risk factors and AKI (exposure to nephrotoxic drugs, degree of multiple organ failure, PPHN, vasoactive/inotropic requirement, oxygenation index, fluid overload and hyperchloremia) during PICU stay. The association of the risk factors to different stages of AKI will also be investigated.",COMPLETED,,2023-02-01,2024-11-25,2024-11-25,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,109,ACTUAL

Although there was a large progress in development of medical therapy, the quality of life, the physical efficiency and the prognosis of the patients are still limited. The aim of the study is to examine the influence of physical training to clinical and molecular parameter.","The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study in patients with pulmonary hypertension, who are under stable optimized treatment for at least 2 months, is to examine the effect of an additional exercise and respiratory therapy.

The aim criteria measures the clinical parameters to record the effect of the training plus molecular parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. The molecular parameters are composed of laboratory parameter and inflammatory parameter as well as genetic analyses, measurements of epigenetic changes measured by microRNA Expressions and DNA-methylation.

The study parameters will be assessed in the patient's routine examinations. Clinical parameters comprise of hemodynamic assessment of pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise, pump function of left and right ventricle, and further echocardiographic parameters. Improvement of exercise capacity will be measured by the change of six-minute walking distance, the breathing economics, the world health organization functional class (WHO functional class), peak oxygen consumption and blood gas analysis. The quality of life will be assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire. Data for survival analysis will be gained by structured phone interviews . The safety of the training is warranted by long-term, rest- and stress-ECG, safety laboratory, systemic blood pressure, heart frequency, oxygen saturation and occurrence of adverse events.

Patients will be examined in the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg. Patients of the training group will take part in a specific, 3-week inpatient training program at the rehabilitation center Königstuhl Heidelberg. The training program consists of exercise and respiratory therapy as well as a mental gait training. Respiratory therapy will be performed 5 times/week for 30 minutes. Furthermore, 15-25 minutes low dosed interval training on a bicycle ergometer, dumbbell training of particular muscle groups with low weights and supervised walks on ground-level will be scheduled 5-7 times/week. Three- to five times a week a ""mental gait training"" is conducted to estimate the patient's individual physical abilities and limitations. The heart rate during exerciseand the intensity of the training will be closely monitored and individually adjusted. After three weeks of in-hospital rehabilitation the patients are asked to continue the training for twelve further weeks at home.

However, the causes of preeclampsia are little known and heavy metals merit further investigation. We tested whether late-onset preeclampsia (L-PrE) was associated with exposure to these metals.

Methods: This study was designed to determine maternal plasma cadmium, lead and vanadium concentrations in women with L-PrE (n=46) compared to those of normotensive women (n=46). These three heavy metals concentrations measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry were compared.","This observational case-control study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cengiz Gokcek Public Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey, between March 2018 and June 2019. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of Gaziantep University (reference no: 2019/36). The study strictly adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects included in the study gave oral and written informed consent. Ninety-two women were enrolled in the study in two groups.

Data collection and Study intervention:

The diagnosis of L-PrE, as defined by the Committee on Terminology of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), is established based on the presence of proteinuria (urinary excretion of protein ≥300 mg in a 24-h urine specimen, or proteinüria ≥1+ in dipstick) and a blood pressure level of ≥90/140 mmHg (two blood pressure measurements 6 h apart) that occurs after 34 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. The diastolic and/or systolic blood pressure \<110/160 mm Hg, it was accepted as mild; and in case these values exceeded this level, it was accepted as severe. Every women in the study population underwent obstetric ultrasound examination and fetal-maternal assesment was carried out by one of the authors. The obstetric anamnesis were obtained from all subjects. The dempograhic data like age, gravidity, parity, body mass index (BMI) and gestational age were recorded. The gestational age was determined by calculation from the last menstrual period and supported by the ultrasonography measurements at first trimester of gestation. Maternal venous plasma samples were taken for measurement of cadmium, lead and vanadium levels after the diagnosis of L-PrE in outpatient clinic. These samples quickly centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min, plasma samples were seperated and stored at -80 C until the day of measurement. All patients with L-PrE were also hospitalized and their pregnancies were terminated. The samples of the control groups were obtained during the routine obstetrical care examination in the third trimester of pregnancy. Then, these pregnant women were followed-up until the delivery. Both groups were compared in terms of maternal age, BMI, week of gestation, gravida, parity, live born, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, total protein in spot urine sample, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, white blood cell count, urea, uric acid, albümin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests (AST, ALT), lactic acid dehydrogenase, cadmium, lead and vanadium concentrions and infant weight at delivery. Small for gestational age (SGA) neonate was defined as birth weight \<10th percentile for gestational age with Turkey's national nomogram as the reference for fetal growth. The samples were transferred within boxes in ice molds to Yozgat Bozok University Science and Technology Application and Research Center (Occupational and Environmental Toxicology Laboratory) for measuring heavy metal and trace element levels. The frequency of seafood consumption was divided into four categories: 2-3 per week, 1-2 per week, 1-2 per month, and rare. Smoking was classified into 3 groups (none, formerly smoker, and active smoking). Passive smoking was also categorized into 2 groups (no and yes). The education levels was classified into 4 groups (illiterate, primary education, high school, and university). The residences of women was classified as rural and urban. Furthermore, the residences of women have divided either living near a busy street (around 100 metres) or not.Small for gestational age (SGA) neonate was defined as birth weight \<10th percentile for gestational age with Turkey's national nomogram as the reference for fetal growth.

The method developed by Aliyev et al. was used for preparing the samples for analysis One milliliter of plasma samples was placed into high-temperature-resistant Teflon tubes in a microwave oven, and 5 mL Suprapur® (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) nitric acid (HNO3) and 5 mL ultra-pure water was added. All plasma samples were digested using a microwave digestion system (Start D; Milestone, MD, USA). After digestion, each sample was made to a total volume of 20 mL with 9 mL ultra-pure water in a 50 mL polypropylene tube. Nitric acid (Suprapur®, 65%) was used for digestion of samples and standard reference material. Ultra-pure water (Direct-Q®; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for dilution of the standard (multi-element standard Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium) and sample preparations.

The three metals (cadmium, lead and vanadium) were measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific ICAPQc, USA). The operating parameters were set as follows: radiofrequency power 1550 W, nebulizer gas 0.96 L/min, plasma gas 0.88 L/min, nebulizer pressure 3.01 bar, dwell time 0.01 milliseconds, and spray chamber temperature 3.7°C. The sampler probe was washed between injections by rinsing with ultrapure water for 30 s, followed by washing with 2% HNO3 for 45 s, and finally rinsing with ultrapure water for 45 s. After the washing steps, the instrument automatically ran the next sample. An 11-point calibration curve (0.5-500 µg/L) was used to measure the level of each element. The r2 values of the calibration curves of all metals were calculated, and the minimum value was 0.9994. To ensure the accuracy of the results, each measurement of the samples and standards was repeated three times. The results of these measurements showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD) did not exceed 5%. Certified Reference Material (CRM-Seronorm™ Trace Elements Whole Blood L-2, Sero AS, Billingstad, Norway) was used for the validation method. To check the stability and sensitivity of the instrument, a mixture of internal standards (Hf) was used, and the mean and RSD values of metals were also calculated. The variations of each measurement of the quality controls was \<15%.

NCT02558582,Effect of Exercise Training in Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension,Effect of Exercise Training in Arterial and Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension in Switzerland and Standardization With European Countries,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a serious disease with a dismal prognosis when left untreated. Advances in medical therapy have improved survival according to recent registries and systematic reviews, but are associated with high healthcare costs.

Earlier studies in Heidelberg, Germany showed good evidence for the effect of exercise training on improving exercise performance, quality of life and pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

The main objectives of the present project are:

1. to investigate the quality of the implementation of a standardized 3 week in-hospital exercise training program on markers of outcome and disease severity in PH-patients in Switzerland immediately after training and after 3 and 12 month.
2. to look whether training with hyperoxia vs. standard care might be more effective.

This is a multicentre, randomized parallel-group trial where the intervention rehabilitation is delayed in one group so that they can serve as standard care controls for the others.

In a nested single-centre randomized-controlled trial patent will additionally be randomized to receive either usual rehabilitation (UR) or rehabilitation with standardized supplemental oxygen therapy (SSOT) during nights and ergometer training.

Patients will receive a PH specific rehabilitation program during 3 weeks followed by an instructed home-based training program for 12 weeks. Patients who are not already under long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) due to daytime hypoxemia will additionally be randomized to receive standardized supplemental oxygen therapy (SSOT) during training and nights upon written informed consent.",,UNKNOWN,,2015-09-01,2023-12,2023-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,32,ESTIMATED

The investigators were looking to recruit around 40 Veterans from Buffalo and Syracuse to be in this study. What it entailed is being randomly assigned to one of two conditions. If patients are assigned to the first condition, their upcoming primary care appointment will be extended by about 5 minutes because a Health Educator will join the end of that appointment. If they are assigned to the second condition they would have their typical primary care appointment. Beyond that, both conditions are quite similar. They will have an individual meeting following the primary care appointment with the Health Educator, two phone booster meetings at 2 and 4 weeks, and information about an optional app that they have the choice to use to help them track some health behaviors.","Many Veterans (30.4%) with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to engage in behaviors that increase risk of cardiovascular events and early mortality, such as smoking or hazardous drinking. While the VA has several programs designed to help Veterans quit smoking or quit/reduce drinking, there is a gap in service for Veterans who are not ready for change-based treatments but continue to smoke or drink hazardously. VA Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) screen all patients annually for alcohol and tobacco use, and thus the PACT platform is an ideal way to reach Veterans with CVDs who smoke and/or drink hazardously. Through the Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) initiative, mental and behavioral health providers are embedded to provide effective, evidence-based, Veteran-centered, behavioral health interventions for a variety of co-occurring behavioral health concerns and medical problems. Educational and self-monitoring interventions are evidence-based and increase substance users' intentions to make a behavior change, and additionally improve patient factors including engagement, willingness to accept behavioral health referrals, and self-management strategies. This research proposal focuses on adapting elements of these evidence-based interventions specifically for a PACT-based VA setting to appeal to Veterans not yet ready to change smoking and/or drinking. This intervention aims to increase intention to change and may improve rates of cessation and engagement with change-based programs. The intervention will fill a gap in care and potentially improve the health and longevity of Veterans seen in PACT. The intervention, called CARE, will be piloted in two formats: 1) that includes a conjoint meeting between a PACT medical provider and a behavioral health provider; and 2) only with a behavioral health provider.",COMPLETED,,2022-05-13,2024-04-30,2024-04-26,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,PREVENTION,44,ACTUAL

Hypertension is an increasing global problem and measures are needed against the emerging hypertensive burden. Management of the risk factor hypertension consists of medical treatment in conjunction with lifestyle adjustment, whereby lifestyle adjustment is the preventive cornerstone but has also been proven to contribute to BP reduction among those already receiving medical drug treatments. Non-adherence is a significant barrier to successful hypertension management.

Goal:

To improve management of hypertension in daily life from a person-centred perspective, utilizing information and communication technology, and further to decrease complications of hypertension. To increase the proportion of persons with hypertension obtaining a BP goal =\<140/90 mmHg and to conduct a health economic evaluation of our intervention.

Plan:

The investigators will conduct a multi-centre randomized controlled trial in 36 primary care centres in three counties in Sweden. There will be approximaely 430 patients in each group. BP will be measured in a standardized manner, laboratory tests taken and questionnaires answered at baseline, after eight weeks and after a year in both the intervention and the control group. Register data on health care resource one year before baseline and for the full study period will be retrieved for participants in both study groups.

Singificance:

The intervention is expected to improve adherence to treatment and a significant lowering of the blood pressure. Hospitalization rates are lower among persons with hypertension that adheres to their medication. By improving treatment of hypertension the hope is to decrease complications and morbidity due to hypertension and thereby hospitalization and health care costs. Due to the generic nature of the technology involved, the self-management system can easily be adapted to monitor other chronic conditions.",,COMPLETED,,2018-10-01,2021-04-18,2021-01-20,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,971,ACTUAL

The only known definitive treatment is delivery. Although delivery is always appropriate for the mother, it might not be the best for a very premature neonate.

In cases of non-severe preeclampsia there no benefit delaying delivery beyond 37 weeks. It is also well established that before 34 weeks an expectant management confers perinatal benefit with minimum amount of additional maternal risk. There is then an area of uncertainty between 37 and 37 weeks. This is why in this period it is a clinical need to select high risk patients of complications that will benefit from labor induction, and differentiate them from low risk patients that can be manage expectantly until 37 weeks.

Placental growth factor (PlGF) is an angiogenic factor that is lower in pregnant women with preeclampsia and current evidence shows that it as a predictor of adverse pregnancy outcome and requirement of delivery.

Circulating levels of PIGF at 34 weeks could help to identify those women that may benefit from labor induction and those where delivery can be delayed until 37 weeks with low risk for maternal complications.","BACKGROUND

The current definition of pre-eclampsia is a new onset hypertension (\>140/90mmHg) and proteinuria (\>0'3g per 24 hours) after 20 weeks of gestation. Pre-eclampsia affects 3% to 8% of all pregnancies and it is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

It has been subclassified by clinical severity in severe and non-severe and by gestational age at the diagnosis in early and late onset pre-eclampsia (\>34 weeks of gestation).

Pre-eclampsia is associated with abnormal placentation and uterine angiogenesis. Pregnant women with preeclampsia show lower circulating levels of placental growth factor (PlGF), a proangiogenic factor related to placental angiogenesis, compared with healthy pregnant women. Moreover evidence has been found regarding the role of PlGF as a predictor of adverse pregnancy outcome and requirement of delivery.

The only definitive treatment of the disease is delivery. In patients with non-severe preeclampsia between 34 and 37 weeks there is no consensus regarding the ideal time of delivery.

AIM: The aim of this study is to assess whether circulating levels of PIGF at 34 weeks could help to identify those women that may benefit from labor induction and those where delivery can be delayed until 37 weeks with low risk for maternal complications.",UNKNOWN,,2014-06,2019-12,2018-11,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,300,ESTIMATED

The risk of bleeding from gastric varices is relatively low. However, the bleeding is usually significant and severe.

Current guidelines recommend endoscopic glue injection as the first line of treatment for gastric variceal bleeding.

Although this technique has been shown to be effective, it is associated with many severe adverse events including systemic embolization, fever, chest pain, and even death. The rate of hemostasis has been reported to be as high as 91-100% but the rebleeding rate from gastric varices still present.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided therapy has recently been introduced as a more effective and safer option than endoscopic therapy for gastric varices. EUS-guided therapy includes EUS guided Cyanoacrylate injection alone or in combination with EUS-guided coiling. It offers the advantage of directly visualizing the varices and delivering targeted therapy.

A standard endoscopic examination only allows the evaluation of superficial varices. The use of Endoscopic ultrasound facilitates evaluation of peri-gastric and perforating vessels, which are directly involved in variceal development. EUS also facilitates accurate placement of the coil and preserves the naturally formed splenorenal shunt.

Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration(BRTO) has been reported to achieve satisfactory bleeding control rates for isolated gastric varices with High hemostasis rates and low rebleeding rate.

CIH profiles, including the its length, speed and intensity were widely different in individuals. Until recently, the influence of OSAS-related IH profiles on hypertension development has not been fully explored. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different CIH properties on blood pressure (BP) and short-term blood pressure variability (BPV) in severe OSAS patients.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents the airway collapse, avoids the occurrence of intermittent hypoxemia and arousal, is the preferred treatment for OSAS and has been widely used in clinical. In theory, CPAP maintains upper airway patency and preserves ventilation, thereby inhibits the chain reaction over activation of the sympathetic nervous system and blood pressure regulating mechanism, thus CPAP treatment have adequate scientific basis to cause a substantial reduction arterial blood pressure, but controlled studies showed either no effect or only a minor decrease in arterial blood pressure by 1.4 and 2.5 mmHg respectively.The current, which type of combination of hypertension OSA patients can obtain the best antihypertensive benefit from CPAP therapy is still under debate.","Nocturnal BP was continuously monitored via measurement of pulse transmit time (PTT). The value of apnea-related systolic BP elevation (△BP) was used to reflect short-term BPV. Beat-to-beat RR interval data were incorporated in polysomnography for heart rate variability analysis. LF/HF band ratio was compared between two groups which used to reflect sympatho-vagal balance. The length of the desaturation event was measured to the nearest 0.5 second (△t). The fall in SpO2 during apnea was calculated as the gap from start of the desaturation to the nadir of the desaturation. The rate of fall in SpO2 was counted as the change in the percentage of SpO2 per second (△SpO2 /△t) and expressed as oxygen desaturation rate (ODR), which reflected the speed and efficacy of oxygen desaturation during an apnea event. One hundred and two severe OSAS subjects were divided into two groups according to the their median ODR: faster ODR and slower ODR.

NCT07031739,Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to Reduce Food Insecurity,Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to Reduce Food Insecurity and Improve Adherence in Patients With Hypertension,"Food insecurity affects 20% of the 116 million people in the US with hypertension and is associated with poor adherence to evidence-based treatments and disparities in hypertension outcomes. Interventions are being used to address food insecurity in clinical care settings, but people differ in the support they need to reduce food insecurity and little is known about which food insecurity interventions work best, or for whom. The goal of this study is to develop and test an adaptive food insecurity intervention using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to determine which initial food insecurity intervention is more effective in improving adherence and blood pressure in patients with hypertension and for those who do not respond to the initial intervention, evaluate how to best provide additional support.","In the US, 47% of adults have hypertension (HTN), and HTN is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Uncontrolled HTN increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive impairment. Current guidelines recommend the adoption of a healthy diet as an integral part of ongoing treatment regardless of the underlying antihypertensive drug treatment. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern is a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains with a reduced content of sodium and saturated fat. The DASH is the diet with the strongest evidence to be effective for lowering blood pressure. Despite the evidence base for the effectiveness of DASH as well as pharmacological treatments, economic factors are common barriers to individuals with HTN adhering to treatments. Adherence is multidimensional and involves initiation, implementation, and persistence. Food insecurity (FI), the lack of consistent access to the food needed for a healthy life, is an important factor that leads to HTN disparities. Individuals living in food insecure households are less likely to adhere to prescribed HTN treatments, such as DASH and medications, and more likely to have worse blood pressure control.

Because of the prevalence of FI and associated poor health outcomes, a growing number of health systems and health insurers are investing in integrating interventions to address FI as part of routine clinical care. These interventions include 1) providing information to patients about community resources), 2) utilizing community health workers (CHW), and 3) home delivery of medically tailored meals (MTM). Studies have shown these FI interventions have varying levels of success on improving food security and health. However, people often need varying levels of support to address needs, and, rather than using only one single intervention to address FI, there remains a gap in understanding whether adaptively allocating resources based on need has the potential to more effectively, equitably, and efficiently improve food security and health for a greater proportion of patients.

To advance the science in patient adherence and blood pressure management, this study will conduct a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) among food-insecure patients with uncontrolled HTN. SMART uses experimental design principles to determine whether and how to alter treatments to build optimal adaptive interventions. This study will assess the change in adherence and blood pressure over time (0-9 months). This study will also evaluate if treatment options were more effective for particular patients. Several other measures are included in this study to learn more about how an adaptive intervention designed to address FI affects blood pressure, adherence, food security, health-related quality of life, and other key risk factors for blood pressure control in patients with HTN.

The proposed Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to reduce Food Insecurity and Improve Adherence in Patients with Hypertension (SMART-FI) is a single-site, open-label, longitudinal two-stage SMART. Participants will be randomized to one of two first-stage treatments for 3 months: 1) information about community resources or 2) in-person CHW support. Participants who do not have a 10mmHg improvement in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3 months will be re-randomized to one of two second-stage treatments for an additional 3 months: 1) CHW support or 2) home delivery of MTM. The study will recruit 224 participants for this trial. Participants will engage in the interventions up to 6 months and will be followed for a total of 9 months. In Aim 1, the study will determine which first-stage FI intervention is more effective in improving adherence and blood pressure. In Aim 2, the study will evaluate which FI intervention is the best next step for those who do not respond to the initial intervention. In Aim 3, the study will explore how, why, and under what circumstances participants achieved improvements to the first- and second-stage interventions by conducting semi-structured interviews with participants and evaluating for potential predictors of heterogeneity in response to each intervention.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2025-08,2030-02,2029-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,NONE,TREATMENT,224,ESTIMATED

It (a) uses electronic health record (EHR) technology to deliver patient-specific clinical decision support (CDS) to providers at the point of care, (b) assesses the impact of this intervention on identification and clinical care of hypertension in adolescents, and (c) assesses the impact of the intervention on costs of care.","Hypertension (HT) during adolescence tracks into adulthood, contributing to adult cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents were developed by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP); their Fourth Report was published in 2004. Despite heightened awareness of hypertension in pediatric populations, most adolescents with elevated blood pressure remain clinically unrecognized. Factors that contribute to this gap in care include: the need to translate adolescent blood pressure (BP) measures into blood pressure percentiles on the basis of age, gender, and height, lack of familiarity with National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) clinical guidelines, and competing demands at clinical encounters.

Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) can be used to address these barriers and support better care of elevated blood pressure (BP) and Hypertension (HT) in adolescents. In this project, the investigators integrate EHR-extracted data with sophisticated Web-based CDS algorithms to provide patient-specific point-of-care clinical recommendations, in accordance with NHBPEP guidelines. To evaluate the impact of this innovation on quality and cost of care, the investigators randomize 18 clinics with their 130 pediatric care providers (PCP) and their estimated 17,000 adolescent patients to receive or not receive this EHR-based CDS intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will improve recognition and early management of elevated BP and that short-term increases in outpatient care costs will be offset by longer-term clinical benefits, estimated using established econometric models.

This innovative project (a) addresses the under-recognized high-risk patient population of adolescents, (b) integrates EHR and Web-based CDS technology to provide sophisticated patient-specific point-of-care CDS, (c) develops and implements novel and intuitive visual interfaces to communicate CDS recommendations to PCPs, and (d) provides both clinical and cost outcome data useful to clinicians and policymakers. If the EHR-based CDS intervention improves adherence to NHBPEP recommendations, it will provide a much-needed tool to combat the burgeoning problem of rising cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents. Further, regardless of outcome, the technology that is developed and tested will provide many useful insights to advance the science of EHR-based CDS. This will, in turn, help translate the massive public and private investments in EHR technology into improved adolescent health outcomes.",COMPLETED,,2014-04,2017-04-16,2016-04-16,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,31579,ACTUAL

Participants will be checked whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes (high blood sugar), high blood pressure or risk of developing cardiovascular disease by asking for medical history, measuring blood pressure, weight and height, and blood glucose if necessary. The main question the study aims to answer is:

Does villagers residing in the VHW supported villages have their blood pressure controlled, adherent to therapy and subsequently reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease after 5 months of monthly VHW home visits?","Myanmar is a Southeast Asian country which has been struggling with active conflict situation since 2021 - resulting massive internal displacement especially in ethnic areas. It is widely known that Community- and village-health worker (VHW) led interventions have reduced CVD risk in stable areas of low and middle income countries, but have not been adapted for internally displaced people (IDPs) exposed to active conflict. In addition, CVD is the leading cause of death in Myanmar and according to recent national survey, 75% of adults have at least one CVD risk factor.

This cRCT study is a third phase of the ""Implementation of a community-led strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease risk among conflict-affected populations in eastern Myanmar"" and Phase 1 and 2 have been successfully completed. The VHW care model was developed based on a Causal Loop Analysis (CLA) workshop in Phase 1 (GWU IRB# NCR234977), which included a Qualitative Study, Causal Loop Analysis workshop and Village Health Worker Intervention Design. The VHW care model was then tested in the Phase 2 Feasibility study (GWU IRB # NCR235114) in 3 villages conducted over three months (November 2023-January 2024).

Specific aim of this study includes:

1. to assess the impact of a village health worker (VHW) care model in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in rural Myanmar by conducting a cluster randomized trial in 13 villages surrounding 3 clinics.

   Hypothesis: High proportions of villagers over 40 are screened for elevated CVD risk (\>90%), attend a confirmatory visit (\>85%), initiate a high proportion of evidence-based therapies (\>75%), participate in at least one follow-up visit (\>70%) and are adherent to therapy at three months (\>50%).
2. to evaluate implementation of the VHW CVD program using the REAIM-PRISM framework.

   Hypothesis: The VHW CVD intervention has broad reach, is acceptable, effective, is widely adopted, and perceived to be sustainable by community partners.
3. to establish the time and cost required to carry out VHW care model activities as well as their impact on the care cascade for CVD risk, from screening to linkage to care, initiation of therapy and retention in care.

Hypothesis: The VHW CVD intervention is cost-effective, affordable, and sustainable.

Advantage of the study:

The VHW care model extends basic monitoring and treatment functions for chronic disease management to remote rural villages where physical terrain, high transportation cost and insecurity limit options for transportation to and from centralized clinic locations. Via VHWs, patient medication adherence, blood pressure, and blood glucose (when relevant) will be reported to treating clinicians (medics). Medics will be able to use this information to either schedule an in-person visit or to remotely refill or titrate medications.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2024-10-27,2025-06-30,2025-04-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,213,ESTIMATED
NCT00000522,Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS),,"To compare the effects of nonpharmacologic therapy alone with those of one of five active drug regimens combined with non-pharmacologic therapy, for long- term management of patients with mild hypertension.","BACKGROUND:

Dietary sodium reduction has a mild effect on the reduction of hypertension. Weight loss, while achievable in the short-run with diet alone, may also have only mild effects on hypertension and is very difficult to maintain with diet and/or behavior modification. Alteration of patients' lifestyles to decrease excessive alcohol intake is somewhat controversial. Medications, on the other hand, have clear benefits in terms of blood pressure lowering, and in the case of diuretics and beta-blockers, reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there is concern about their justified use in mild hypertension since each one has side effects, some of which may have long-term implications, such as alteration in serum lipids. Newer classes of drugs--calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers--had not previously been compared long-term with diuretics and beta-blockers.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

TOMHS I enrolled 902 men and women to determine the feasibility of a larger trial. Participants were randomized in a double-blind manner to one of six treatment groups and within two strata. Stratum I was for participants not on antihypertensive drugs and Stratum II for those on antihypertensive drugs at initial screening. There were six treatment arms: placebo, a diuretic (chlorthalidone), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (acebutolol), an alpha blocker (doxazosin mesylate), a calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate), and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). All participants received a lifestyle intervention program that included reduction of sodium chloride and alcohol intake as well as weight reduction and increase in physical activity. All participants were followed for at least 48 months, with an average of 54 months. The primary endpoint was lowering of blood pressure. The treatments were also compared for effects on blood chemistries including lipoproteins, echocardiographic left ventricular mass, ventricular ectopic activity and ST-T changes of ischemia as measured by ambulatory ECG monitoring, side effects, and quality of life. Randomization took place between October 1986 and March 1988. Active follow-up ended in March-April 1992. Data analysis ended in May 1994.",COMPLETED,,1985-08,1994-05,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,,,TREATMENT,0,

NCT01027039,Will Listening to Music Make it Easier to Take a Visual Field Test?,The Effect of Mozart Music on Visual Field Testing in Glaucoma Patients: Will Music Tame the Savage Perimeter?,The purpose of this study is to examine if there is a difference between glaucoma patients having background music and not having background music before visual field testing.,"Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. Over 2.5 million people in the United States have glaucoma. The goal of ophthalmologists is two-fold: 1) to detect glaucoma early, and 2) to stop the progression of disease and subsequent visual loss.

Many parameters are used to detect and follow glaucoma over the patient's lifetime including optic nerve appearance, intraocular pressure by applanation and visual field perimetry testing results. Perimetry testing aims to detect visual field loss that may be associated with glaucoma and institute more aggressive treatment measures when necessary. However, it is suspected that 50% or more of the optic nerve fibers are already irreversibly damaged before a visual field defect can be identified on testing. Furthermore, the patient's ability to take a visual field test is paramount in the doctor's ability to interpret the test. That is, if a visual field test taker performs the test with low reliability (i.e. too many false positive, false negative or fixation losses), the interpretability of the test by the ophthalmologist is difficult or impossible.

Interestingly, a recent study in the British Journal of Ophthalmology suggested the positive effect Mozart music has on visual field test taking ability. This study showed better first time automated perimetry performance in normals immediately following exposure to the first 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major. The music group had 20 times fewer fixation losses, three times fewer false positive responses and 10 times fewer false negative responses.

No study has determined if Mozart music improves the reliability indices of Humphrey visual field testing for glaucoma patients or experienced test takers. In efforts to improve patient's reliability on visual field testing, we propose a randomized controlled trial to determine if listening to music before field testing improves testing reliability.",COMPLETED,,2008-06,2009-09,2009-09,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,160,ACTUAL

NCT05584722,Risk and Resilience in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Genetically Susceptible Individuals,Risk and Resilience in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Genetically Susceptible Individuals,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe disease with a delayed diagnosis and markedly elevated mortality. High-risk populations, such as those with known genetic defects, provide a unique opportunity to determine the features of susceptibility and resilience to PAH. This proposal will fundamentally overturn the prevailing understanding of PAH by creating molecularly-driven signatures of susceptibility and resilience, provide novel insight into disease severity, and potentially identify new therapeutic targets.

Funding Source - FDA OOPD","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an orphan disease with a delayed diagnosis and markedly elevated mortality from right heart failure. Despite nearly a dozen FDA-approved drugs for PAH, median survival is only seven years. All approved therapies target one of three vasodilatory pathways, and none are disease modifying. This study has two objectives: 1) Understand dynamic and static relationships between molecular markers and PAH progression and resilience; 2) Identify molecular features of PAH risk and resilience in individuals harboring a PAH-causing mutation. It is unknown why some at risk individuals develop PAH and others do not. BMPR2 mutations are present in about 30% of patients with PAH but clinical penetrance is only 20%. Unaffected BMPR2 mutation carriers (UMCs) are a unique and understudied population that may also provide clues to disease trajectory in patients with clinical PAH. Longitudinal natural history studies with molecular profiling in PAH are lacking. Most molecular profiling studies in PAH are cross-sectional which limits understanding of how disease progression and disease markers relate over time. The Investigators propose a strategy of dense clinical and molecular phenotyping at multiple timepoints to overcome inferential limitations of cross-sectional studies. This application will leverage the clinical and research infrastructure built at Vanderbilt over the past 35 years in our study of PAH patients. The investigators share an extensive published record of recruiting patients with this rare disease and related UMCs. The Investigators hypothesize that a comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience over time in patients and genetically susceptible individuals will provide insight into disease severity and identify novel therapeutic targets in patients with PAH. Aim 1 will identify static and dynamic molecular features of disease progression and resilience. 1a: Perform serial clinical, proteomic, and gene expression profiling in HPAH, IPAH, and healthy controls 3 times over 4 years. Bioinformatic and network medicine analyses will identify proteins and RNAs associated with changes in clinical outcomes, functional capacity, and RV function in the parent cohort and two external validation cohorts.1b: Test whether adding molecular risk/resilience markers will improve the performance of a widely used PAH risk prediction tool (REVEAL 2.0 Risk Score). Aim 2 will identify the clinical and molecular factors that promote resilience and susceptibility to PAH in a longitudinal cohort of UMCs. UMCs will undergo serial clinical and molecular phenotyping as in Aim 1. Proteins/genes that mirror PAH are ""risk factors"" and those that mirror a healthy population are ""resilience factors"". Explanatory models will be developed and tested in validation cohorts. The Investigators will test UMC risk and resilience features for associations with clinical outcomes in PAH patients and risk prediction performance. These studies will identify signatures of risk and resilience to PAH progression and penetrance, offering an initial step toward personalizing care and surveillance guided by biologic data.",RECRUITING,,2022-11-01,2026-08-31,2026-08-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,150,ESTIMATED

The medical term for this is Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH). LVH makes the heart less efficient and patients with LVH are at a 10 times greater risk of heart complications than those without it.

A goal of treating high blood pressure is to reduce the strain on the heart and to try to decrease this thickening of the heart wall. However, even when blood pressure is treated and is under control, LVH can persist, and as there are no symptoms to LVH it can go undetected.

Currently the only way to reduce LVH would be to lower blood pressure (BP) even further. This can cause side-effects from low BP such as dizziness and nausea.

It has previously been shown that a drug allopurinol, which is usually used to treat gout had the remarkable side effect of being able to reduce this thickening of the heart wall in patients who had kidney disease or diabetes. The aim now is to see if patients with high blood pressure and LVH may also benefit from treatment with allopurinol. If LVH can be reduced using allopurinol, this might be a new way to reduce cardiac risk in these patients without needing to lower BP even further.

In this study the aim is to recruit 66 patients who have treated and well controlled blood pressure but may still have LVH. They will be screened for LVH by doing an ultrasound scan of the heart and then that will be confirmed with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, which is a special scan of the heart using an MRI machine to measure the extent of thickening of the heart muscle before they start on treatment of allopurinol or placebo.

As this is a clinical trial the participants will be randomly allocated to either allopurinol or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment so that the investigators can compare if there is a difference between normal treatment and addition of allopurinol. All the patients currently prescribed medication for their high blood pressure will continue as normal on that. They will have a further MRI scan when their one year treatment with allopurinol or placebo finishes.

Benefits - You will be monitored closely during the study and will be seen by a doctor with a special interest in cardiology at each of your study visits and your medication will be reviewed on a regular basis. The tests will give us information about the function of your heart, kidneys and blood circulation. If any of these investigations, including information from the MRI scan of your heart reveal any new abnormality we will either discuss this with your hospital consultant or refer you to a specialist clinic (whichever seems most appropriate). The study will not immediately benefit you, but if the results of the study are positive it may change the practice of managing patients with treated high blood pressure but may still have LVH, like you and potentially will have a great impact on other such patients in the future. If so, you may gain eventually from our discovering a new treatment for your condition.

Risks - The side effects of the allopurinol are very rare (less than 1 in 10,000 people) and include headache, stomach upset, drowsiness and anaemia. Having blood tests taken can cause some mild bruising. The flow mediated dilatation may cause temporary numbness. MRI scanning is very safe and does not use radiation but some may feel a bit closed in. The scanner is a bit noisy but you will be given ear protection which also plays music. Your kidney function will be assessed before the scan to ensure it is safe to give you the contrast agent described above.",COMPLETED,,2014-09,2017-06,2017-06,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,72,ACTUAL

NCT06778239,Childhood-Onset Essential Hypertension Natural History Study,Natural History Study to Determine Childhood-Onset Essential Hypertension Etiology,"Background:

Childhood-onset essential hypertension (COEH) is high blood pressure that develops in children and teens. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. COEH is more likely to be caused by changes in genes rather than by factors like stress or diet. Researchers want to learn more about how changes in genes relate to COEH. They hope to use that information to develop better treatments for children with high blood pressure.

Objective:

This natural history study will look for genes and gene changes that may lead to COEH.

Eligibility:

People aged 2 years and older with COEH or who had COEH when they were children. Healthy relatives of those with COEH are also needed.

Design:

Participants will have one clinic visit per year for up to 10 years. All participants will have a physical exam. They will provide samples of blood and urine. At their first visit, they will have a swab (like a Q-tip) rubbed between their gums and cheeks. They may agree to having a skin biopsy; a piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser will be removed.

Affected participants aged 2 to 17 years old will have additional tests:

* They will have sensors placed on their skin to look at their blood vessels and see how blood is moving in their bodies.
* They will lie or stand while a machine measures the amount of fat and muscle in their bodies.
* They will have an ultrasound; a wand will be rubbed against their skin to take pictures of their kidneys.

Other things are optional for all participants:

* They may have photographs taken of their bodies.
* They may have tests of their heart function.
* They may have different types of imaging scans.","Study Description:

This study seeks to identify molecular processes and genetics that contribute to the development of childhood-onset essential hypertension (COEH) in a diverse cohort of children. Identification of blood pressure (BP)-regulating pathway(s) involved in COEH will allow for targeted and individualized therapy.

NCT02034422,Understanding the Exercise-Hypertension Paradox,Understanding the Exercise-Hypertension Paradox: Implication for Rehabilitation,"Hypertension affects 37% of the Veteran population, making it the most common medical condition treated by the VA Health Care System. Physical activity is the first line of defense in the treatment and management of hypertension. However, individuals with hypertension have impaired muscle blood flow and exhibit exaggerated increases in blood pressure during exercise (exercise pressor reflex or EPR) leading to exercise intolerance and increased risk of stroke and heart attack. The cause of these impairments is not known, but it is highly likely that free radical production and the subsequent increase in oxidative stress plays a significant role. Two aims are proposed; Aim 1 will identify the physiological consequences of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension, and Aim 2 will utilize an antioxidant treatment to ameliorate the effects of an exaggerated EPR allowing the safe performance of a clinical exercise rehabilitation program which will then, itself, attenuate the EPR and reduce hypertension.","Nearly 37% of all Veterans are clinically hypertensive, making hypertension the most common medical condition in the VA Health Care System. Importantly, of the 67 million Americans diagnosed with hypertension less than half are being effectively treated for their condition. Hypertension constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and when left untreated leads to the development of heart failure, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke, and renal disease. Exercise and regular physical activity are considered the cornerstones of prevention and management of hypertension. However, individuals with hypertension exhibit exercise intolerance characterized by impaired skeletal muscle blood flow and heightened afferent fiber sensitivity leading to an exaggerated or greater than normal physiologic increase in blood pressure during exercise (i.e. exercise pressor reflex or EPR). This imbalance between the beneficial effects of exercise and exercise intolerance creates an interesting paradox, the causes and consequences of which are poorly understood. The etiology of hypertension is undoubtedly complex, however a common denominator in this condition, elevated oxidative stress, may contribute to impaired muscle blood flow and heightened skeletal muscle afferent feedback leading to the exaggerated EPR. Previous work from the investigators' laboratory and others suggests that elevated oxidative stress associated with aging impairs muscle blood flow. Additionally, free radicals, the initiators of oxidative stress, can directly stimulate skeletal muscle afferent fibers leading to the exaggerated EPR. Importantly, the role of oxidative stress in regulating muscle blood flow and afferent fiber function in human hypertension has not been determined. Preliminary studies support a significant role of oxidative stress in impairing muscle blood flow and contributing to the exaggerated EPR in hypertension. With this information as context two aims are proposed that will systematically identify the consequences of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension. Specific Aim 1 will determine the consequences of oxidative stress by examining how elevated free radicals contribute to heightened skeletal muscle afferent feedback and impaired muscle blood flow during exercise in hypertension leading to the exaggerated EPR. Additionally, vascular endothelial cells collected from an antecubital vein will provide novel insight regarding the endothelium as potential source of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension. Specific Aim 2 will determine the effectiveness of combined antioxidant therapy and exercise rehabilitation in the treatment of hypertension. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide novel information regarding the role of oxidative stress as a critical regulator of cardiovascular and hemodynamic responses to exercise in hypertension. By identifying potential causes and consequences of oxidative stress, important insight will be gained facilitating the development of novel approaches and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hypertension. Importantly, the practical applications tested in these studies (i.e. antioxidant treatment and combined exercise rehabilitation) are designed to identify and document effective countermeasures to aid in the treatment and management of hypertension allowing for the safe performance of exercise in a large number of Veterans.",COMPLETED,,2014-02-01,2021-12-31,2021-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,75,ACTUAL

NCT02873039,Correlation Between Estimated Right Atrial Pressure and BNP in Pulmonary HTN (CRAB-PH),Correlation Between Estimated Right Atrial Pressure and BNP in Pulmonary Hypertension (CRAB-PH),"Over the past decade, advancements in therapies available for pulmonary hypertension (PH) have increased life expectancy for those who qualify and receive treatment. Yet, prognostication of these patients has remained a clinical dilemma. The application of the REVEAL registry predictive algorithm provides information about estimated 1-year survival but since invasive measurements from a right heart catheterization cannot easily be repeated, it is not feasible to continually use this longitudinally to assess the disease burden. Simple tests such as BNP has been shown to be very clinically relevant in short -term and long term prognostication and seems to correspond well to the right ventricular failure. Elevated right atrial pressures, and its estimation via IVC measurements predict poor survivorship in a recent retrospective analysis. As clinical measurement of jugular venous pressure is becoming less reliable, we aim to bring point- of-care ultrasound to the outpatient setting. Point of care ultrasound is widely used in the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit settings. By measuring estimated right atrial pressure (eRAP) via Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) measurements at outpatient clinic visits we aim to find a correlation with the existing and widely used B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), that is collected at each visit as a part of regular care. These measurements can be followed longitudinally and may aid in prognostication. Data will be collected over the period of 1 year at clinic visits. A composite endpoint (including death, hospitalizations for PH, addition of new PH specific therapy after a stabilization period of 3 months, lung transplant or atrial septostomy) will separately be collected.

Pulmonary hypertension can result from a multitude of pathologies, including arterial etiologies, venous, chronic hypoxia related, thromboembolic, and other miscellaneous etiologies. In the recent Dana Point Classification, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was classified as Group 1. In Group 1 PAH, the pathologic lesion is localized to the small muscular pulmonary arteries, resulting in luminal narrowing and resistance to blood flow. Group 1 PAH includes idiopathic or sporadic PAH and heritable PAH which includes those with a family history of PAH. Associated PAH includes disease associated with connective tissue disease as well as PAH associated with congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Drug and toxin induced PAH is also in Group 1. Untreated, patients with PAH have an average life expectancy of 3 years, which declines to approximately 1 year if right heart failure is present.

Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a potent acute vasodilator. Its acute administration results in improved hemodynamics in the 10 to 15% of patients with PAH who demonstrate acute vasoreactivity. However, the usefulness of NO for chronic therapy is limited by the need for continuous inhalation. In patients who demonstrate vasoreactivity during an acute challenge with inhaled NO or a prostanoid challenge, therapy with calcium channel blockers has been demonstrated to result in improved symptoms and survival. In patients who do not demonstrate an acute vasodilator response, available therapies for PAH include prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), and phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. However, the route and frequency of administration of the prostanoids, the hepatotoxicity of the ERAs, and concerns about the sustained efficacy of both the ERAs and PDE-5 inhibitors suggests that many patients with PAH could benefit from an effective therapy which offers ease of administration and a favorable toxicity profile.

Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a novel therapeutic, AIR001, for the treatment of PAH. The active ingredient in AIR001 is sodium nitrite, formulated in a buffered, pH-adjusted solution for nebulization. Preclinical data suggest that under the hypoxic, acidotic conditions present in the pulmonary hypertensive lung, inhaled sodium nitrite serves as a sustained release source of NO which will act as an acute pulmonary vasodilator. In addition, because decreased levels of NO have been shown to stimulate vascular remodeling, the increased NO resulting from nitrite inhalation is postulated to attenuate or reverse the pulmonary arterial remodeling process, resulting in both symptomatic improvement and pulmonary hemodynamic improvement in patients with PAH.

Preclinical experiments have shown that AIR001 by oral, IV, and inhalation routes of administration is effective in treating PAH induced by hypoxia or monocrotaline when administered as infrequently as once weekly at doses that generate plasma concentrations of approximately 1 to 10 uM and above. While the precise mechanism by which AIR001 exerts anti-hypertensive actions in PAH models remains to be elucidated, nitrite itself has been demonstrated to be metabolized to NO in animals and humans.

Single doses of AIR001 have been shown to be well tolerated in humans at dose levels that generate peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in the target range established in preclinical models and no safety issues have been identified. AIR001 reduced PH induced by hypoxic gas inhalation in healthy volunteers at doses that are well tolerated. Preclinical and clinical data support further clinical investigation of inhaled AIR001 for the treatment of PAH. Before progressing to studies in patients with PAH, the safety and tolerability of multiple dose administration of AIR001 will be evaluated in Part A of the current study.

The PDE-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, is approved for use in patients with PAH and commonly used in the initial treatment for PAH. AIR001 is converted to NO, which increases cGMP dependent vasodilatation. Because PDE-5 inhibitors prevent the catabolism of cGMP by phosphodiesterase, it is possible that an exaggerated drug effect could be observed when AIR001 is administered to patients being treated with sildenafil. Therefore, combination safety and tolerability (in particular orthostatic effects) of escalating single doses of AIR001 will also be evaluated in combination with steady-state sildenafil in Part B of the study.

A cohort of patients with previously diagnosed PAH on stable background therapy will be assessed for safety and tolerability of multiple doses of AIR001 in Part C of the study.

Part D of the study will assess the PK, safety and tolerability of single dose AIR001 with each of three different nebulizers in a randomized crossover design.",COMPLETED,,2011-07,2012-01,2012-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,42,ACTUAL

Despite CV events are the leading cause of death in these patients, no adequately powered trial so far evaluated the specific cardioprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in this population.

Objectives: This prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point (PROBE) trial is primarily aimed at evaluating whether, at comparable blood pressure (BP) control, ACE inhibitor as compared to non-RAS inhibitor therapy significantly reduces the incidence of a composite end point of CV death (including sudden death) and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke in 266 patients with arterial hypertension (pre-dialysis systolic/diastolic BP \>140/90 mmHg or post-dialysis systolic/diastolic BP \>130/80 mmHg or antihypertensive therapy) and/or echocardiography evidence of LVH (cardiac mass index \>130 g/m2 for men and 100 g/m2 for women) who are on dialysis therapy since at least six months. Secondarily, the study will compare the incidence of single components of the primary outcome, new onset paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation, thrombosis of the artero-venous fistula, new onset, progression or regression of LVH, changes in components of the metabolic syndrome, the safety profile of the two treatment regimens and their cost/effectiveness.

Methods: After 1 month wash-out period from previous RAS inhibitor therapy and a baseline evaluation of main clinical and laboratory parameters, patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to 2-year treatment with an ACE inhibitor or a BP lowering regiment not including RAS inhibitors. A balanced distribution according to centre, number of dialysis sessions per week (2 or 3), presence of diabetes (YES/NO), arterial hypertension (YES/NO), LVH (YES/NO) will be achieved by the minimization method. Treatment will be adjusted to achieve and maintain a target BP \<140/90 mmHg (pre-dialysis) and a target BP \<130/80 mmHg (post-dialysis) in both groups.

Expected results: ACE inhibitor compared to non-RAS inhibitor therapy is expected to reduce more effectively fatal and non-fatal CV events, prevent or limit progression or induce regression of LVH, improve some components of the metabolic syndrome, and reduce treatment costs for cardiovascular complications. These findings might help achieving more effective cardioprotection in people on chronic dialysis at lower costs.","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have the broader effect of any drug in cardiovascular medicine, reducing the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, and renal impairment.A recent meta-analysis of 33,500 patients included in six randomized clinical trials and a pooled analysis of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA, and the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) trials showed that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and cardiovascular events also in subjects with coronary artery disease but preserved left ventricular function. However, all the above studies excluded patients with advanced renal insufficiency or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Thus, whether ACE inhibitors may have a specific cardioprotective effect also in this typology of patients is still matter of investigation. This is an issue of major clinical relevance since CV disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the ESRD population and affects as many as 50-60% of ESRD patients.The burden of CV disease in this population is predicted to dramatically increase over the next few years because of the rapidly increasing number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy and the increasing prevalence of ESRD patients at increased cardiovascular risk because of older age, diabetes and hypertension.

Despite the excess CV risk, a consistent proportion of ESRD patients are not given ACE inhibitor therapy because of concern of hyperkalemia. Others, on the contrary, are treated on the basis of results of available trials. However, whether data in subjects without renal insufficiency can be generalized also to those with ESRD is unknown. This is an itchy point since dialysis patients might respond differently to therapies of proven benefits in non-ESRD patients. For instance, data from the German Diabetes and Dialysis study showed that, unlike in the general population, HmGCoA inhibitor therapy failed to decrease CV mortality in a hemodialysis population. Thus, ad hoc studies in the ESRD population are urgently needed. A recent trial, the Fosinopril in Dialysis (FOSIDIAL) study, tried to address this issue, but was clearly underpowered and results were inconclusive. However, evidence of a non significant trend to less cardiovascular events in the ACE inhibitor arm, suggests that ACE inhibitors might have a specific cardioprotective effect also in this population.

Thus, whether ACE inhibitor therapy more effectively than non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduces CV morbidity in high risk patients on chronic dialysis therapy is worth investigating in an adequately powered trial.

Aims

The broad aim of the study is to evaluate whether ACE inhibitor therapy reduces CV mortality and morbidity in high-risk ESRD patients with arterial hypertension and/or LVH who are on chronic hemodialysis therapy since \>6 months.

Primary:

* To assess whether, at comparable BP control, ACE inhibitor as compared to non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduces the incidence of a combined end-point of CV death (including sudden cardiac death and cardiac arrest resuscitation) and myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke.

Secondary:

* To compare the incidence of the single components of the combined end-point, of myocardial or peripheral revascularizations, new onset of atrial fibrillation in one of its three forms (paroxysmal, persistent and permanent) or recurrence of the arrhythmia in patients who experienced paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation previously, hospitalizations for chronic heart failure and thrombosis of the artero-venous fistula.
* To evaluate whether ACE inhibitors prevent, limit progression or achieve regression of LVH and ameliorate some of the components of the metabolic syndrome and whether these effects correlates with CV outcomes.
* To compare the cost/effectiveness of the two treatments.

Safety:

* Serious (including disturbances of cardiac rhythm and electrical conduction possibly related to hyperkalemia) and non-serious adverse events.
* Any clinical or laboratory abnormality -such as symptomatic hypotension, cough, hyperkalemia (serum potassium \>6 mEq/L), anemia requiring increasing doses of erythropoietin- possibly related to ACE inhibitor therapy.

Design:

This prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point (PROBE) trial will include 266 hypertensive ESRD patients with echocardiography evidence of LVH who are on chronic hemodialysis since \>6 months. After 1 month wash-out period from previous RAS inhibitor therapy and stratification for diabetes YES/NO, they will have a baseline evaluation of main clinical and laboratory parameters and will be randomized to 2-year treatment with an ACE inhibitor or a BP lowering regimen not including RAS inhibitors. Treatment will be adjusted to achieve and maintain a target BP \<140/90 mmHg (pre-dialysis) and a target BP \<130/80 mmHg (post-dialysis) in both groups.",COMPLETED,,2009-05,2016-04,2016-04,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,269,ACTUAL

NCT04391439,Heart Rhythm After Intravenous Methylprednisolone Administration,Increased Heart Rhythm in Response to High-dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone Pulse Therapy of Moderate-to-severe Graves' Orbitopathy,"High doses of intravenous (iv.) glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used as a treatment for many autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. According to the European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) guidelines, intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) is an accepted first-line agent for active, moderate-to-severe and very severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO). This treatment is proven to be more efficient and safer than oral GCs. However, some patients may experience adverse cardiovascular effects during the administration of iv. GCs, which in rare cases may even be fatal. There are limited data, mostly obtained from case reports, reporting the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction or heart failure. Increased heart rhythm (HR) has drawn attention of researchers as a possible adverse effect correlated with IVMP. During this study, investigators performed 72-hours of Holter ECG and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to evaluate the impact of IVMP on patients with moderate-to-severe GO, concerning HR and blood pressure (BP) changes. In order to elucidate possible mechanism of observed changes, researchers investigated the level of potassium in serum and urine and catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) in serum. All patients were treated routinely according to EUGOGO recommendations with standard doses of methylprednisolone with standard recommended schedule. Inclusion criterion for the therapy was according to EUGOGO guidelines active, moderate-to-severe and active GO (12 pulses of IVMP 6x0.5g followed by 6x0.25g every week).","The clinical status of patients was evaluated before each pulse, including blood pressure monitoring, glucose level monitoring and symptoms of infection. HR and BP was measured continuously for 3 consecutive days (the day before, the day of IVMP and the day after IVMP) during 1st, 6th and 12th IVMP pulse, using 24-hour Holter ECG and ABMP. Serum laboratory tests for potassium, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured 3 times the day before and the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the second and sixth day after 1st IVMP. Additionally, urine samples for potassium were collected 5 times the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the second and sixth day after 1st IVMP.",COMPLETED,,2011-01-01,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,40,ACTUAL

The attending physician will explain the nature of the study and all patients will be asked to sign an informed consent.

Routine investigations will be performed to all patients including CBC, liver and renal function and urine analysis in addition to albumin creatinine ratio.

Ultrasound scanning including umbilical doppler indices measurement will be done for all cases before delivery using an HDI ultrasound system (AlbiniouTL Ultrasound, Bothell, WA, USA).

Non stress test is routinely done for all hypertensive patients twice weekly as part of routine work up of such patients in our emergency unit using (CTG machine-NSL BT-350 Bistos) (Korea).

Diagnosis of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia

1. preeclampsia: Women with PE fulfilled the criteria if they had hypertension (\> 140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (\> 0.3 gm/day or ≥ +1 by dipstick urine analysis at ≥ 20 weeks of gestation or protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.30 or more). If no proteinuria, hypertension associated with thrombocytopenia, renal or liver impairment, or pulmonary edema was sufficient to diagnose PE as per ACOG Practice Bulletin No .202\[6\].
2. Gestational hypertension:

   It is usually diagnosed when systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg or more or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or both, on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation, in a woman with a previously normal blood pressure \[7\]. Gestational hypertension is considered severe when the systolic level reaches 160 mm Hg or the diastolic level reaches 110 mm Hg, or both \[6\].
3. Chronic hypertension:

It means systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or both, that is diagnosed or present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation on two occasions at least 4 hours apart. Hypertension that is diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and that does not resolve in the typical postpartum period also is classified as chronic hypertension\[8\].

Patients are finally classified to PE with severe features, PE without severe features, Gestational hypertension (mild and severe), chronic hypertension and chronic hypertension with superimposed PE and termination will be done according to the recent recommendation of ACOG \[6, 8\].

Tissue and samples procurement and processing:

Specimen preparation After delivery of the placenta, two tissue fragments, 1st piece about 1x1 cm from the central zone of the maternal surface of the placenta and 2nd piece about 1 x 1 cm from mid segment of umbilical cord will be cut. Each of both samples will be divided and fixed in either a 10% formalin for light microscopic examination or glutaraldehyde 2.5% for Electron microscopic examination.

NCT00005439,Evaluation of Childhood Blood Pressure and Lipid Screening,,"To help clarify the validity, reliability, and utility of blood pressure (BP) and lipid screening in childhood.","BACKGROUND:

To be useful, a screening program depends on an acceptable, valid, and reliable test, and an efficacious and cost-effective intervention in the population of interest. Screening children to detect those at high risk of adult hypertension or hypercholesterolemia was examined from this viewpoint. Long-term studies starting in childhood have so far revealed less than optimal validity of blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels in childhood as predictors of adult levels. However, information was sparse regarding reliability of measurements, accounting for which could improve validity. The efficacy of interventions that could be widely applied in childhood had not yet been demonstrated. In addition, the costs of an extensive screening program and risks such as misclassification, side effects, and labeling needed to be evaluated. The results of this study helped determine whether screening for risk factors in childhood was a useful method for preventing cardiovascular disease in adults.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study examined the following factors that were key elements in the evaluation of screening: 1) within-person variability of BP and lipid measurements (i.e., the reliability of the test) and its impact on tracking of BP and lipids from childhood to adulthood, 2) calculation of predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity of childhood BP and lipid measurements considered as screening tests for adult values, after correcting for within-person variability (i.e., validity), 3) one potentially effective intervention for BP control in children, that is, calcium supplementation, and 4) evaluating the cost-effectiveness of screening to identify children at high risk of developing adult hypertension or hyperlipidemia.

Each subject will test two separate times. One week, they will be taking a daily dose of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the other week they will be taking a placebo.","This study will involve a screening visit and two testing weeks over an approximate 3 week period (this includes a one week ""washout"" period).

Each testing week will have a 3 day salt-controlled diet prior to testing and an approximate 3-hour testing period on Day 4. The 3-hour testing period will include 10 minutes of a baseline rest, 45 minutes of mild stress (competitive video game), and 45 minutes of a recovery rest. A total of 4 blood and 4 urine samples will be collected during the 3-hour period. Each blood draw will consist of about 7 teaspoons for a total of 28 teaspoons per testing week.

During the screening and testing, I will be asked to take the MoCA (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) test in order to measure cognitive thinking after stress. It is a brief 30-question test which takes around 10 minutes to complete. It measures different types of cognitive abilities, including orientation (the approximate position of something/someone), short-term memory (remember information for a short period of time), executive function (planning and problem solving), language abilities (assign appropriate names to appropriate items), and visuospatial ability (determine distance from one object to another). Each question is awarded a particular number of points depending on the accuracy of the answers given. We will be looking to see if the total number of points earned changes in response before and after stress.

Screening Visit: I will come to the GPI or the CRU for a screening visit that will last about 90 minutes. The study will be described in detail and an informed consent will be obtained. Vital signs will be taken (blood pressure, height, weight and BMI - Body Mass Index. A health history and a limited physical exam will be conducted by Dr. White (or a physician delegate) to insure that it is safe for me to participate in the study. A blood sample will be obtained from me to make sure nothing is wrong with my kidneys or liver or have any other chronic illness. If all lab work returns with no abnormalities, then I will be cleared to participate in one of the crossover studies.

I will also select my food and drink items from a food menu for the 3-day diet prior to testing. The items I select will give me enough to eat and drink for the 3 days. All food and drink items will be packed in coolers that I will be responsible for picking up and dropping off daily. I am not to eat any food or drink item(s) other than those provided, except for water. To make sure that I am following the diet, I will be asked to return all of my food wrappers and drink containers to the GPI or CRU. I will also be asked to collect an overnight urine sample each night so that they can see how much salt I am taking in each day. My testing weeks will also be scheduled at this visit.

The last thing that I will be asked to do for the screening visit, is to take the MoCA test which will take approximately 10 minutes. Someone from the research team will instruct me as to what to do for each question and I will answer each one to the best of my ability.

Testing Week One: The week prior to my scheduled testing week, I will pick up my food coolers for the 3 day study diet along with my 7 ½ day prescription of either the MMF or the placebo. In addition, if I am female, I will have to give a urine sample so that a pregnancy test can be performed to make sure I am not pregnant before I start taking the medication. Should the pregnancy test show positive, I will not be allowed to continue participating in the study. I will take the study medication (either MMF or a placebo) 500 mgs twice a day for the 71/2 days as instructed, taking my last dose the morning of testing at GPI.

The coolers will contain the food and drink items that I selected previously at my screening visit. I will also receive the overnight urine collection bottles. During the diet phase of testing, I will collect a urine sample before I go to bed each night and record the time (write the time on the bottle). I will also collect a urine sample as soon as I wake up each morning and record the time. I will be returning the urine collection bottles and food coolers to GPI or CRU starting on the second day of the diet phase. This means that I will return my Monday cooler and urine collection bottle on Tuesday (Day 2). I will then return my Tuesday cooler and collection bottle on Wednesday (Day 3). On Thursday (testing day), I will bring back my Wednesday cooler and urine collection bottle. During the diet phase of the study, if I am female, a pregnancy test will be performed on each overnight urine sample to ensure that I am not pregnant.

On testing day, I will bring with me my Wednesday cooler and overnight urine sample and will be given breakfast before testing begins. Again, if I am female, a pregnancy test will be performed on my last (Wednesday) overnight urine sample to ensure I am not pregnant. I will be taken to a private room for testing and placed into a comfortable reclining chair. A nurse/phlebotomist will insert a small needle attached to a plastic tube called a catheter into a vein in my hand or arm. This procedure will allow the nurse/phlebotomist to collect the 4 blood samples over the 3-hour testing period. The needle stick may cause some temporary pain and may result in a black and blue mark. A device that automatically takes blood pressure will then be put on the opposite arm. I will also be given water in order to take my last dose of medication before testing begins and to sip on during the duration of testing. During the first 10 minute baseline rest period, I will relax in a reclining chair. I can listen to music, read a book or magazine or watch movies to pass the time. My blood pressure will be taken before and after this 10 minute rest period. Once the baseline rest period is over, a blood and urine sample will be collected.

During the stress period, I will play a video game against another subject for 45 minutes. My blood pressure will continue to be measured every 10 minutes. I will also continue to sip on water during this time. At the end of the game, another blood and urine sample will be collected. I will then be asked to complete the MoCA test a second time. It will be the same questions I was asked during the screening visit. A research team member will instruct me again as to how to answer each question and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

The last 45 minute recovery period of relaxation will be the same as the first (reading, listening to music or watching movies). My blood pressure will continue to be taken every 10 minutes. Once the 45 minutes has ended the last blood and urine sample will be collected and the testing day will then be completed.

Testing Week Two: The procedures for the Testing Week 2 are the same as Week 1. I will be on the controlled salt diet for 3-days, will take the study medication twice a day and will do the 3-hour testing on the 4th day. Like the first week, there will be 10 minute baseline rest period, 45 minutes stress period of the competitive video game and 45 minutes recovery rest period. Blood and urine samples will also be collected and I will be asked to take the MoCA test just like during Week 1 testing. Approximately 56 teaspoons of blood will be collected during the entire study. This blood will be used to examine how biochemical factors (stress hormones) relate to blood pressure and cardiovascular (heart) health. The DNA (genetic material) from the blood will be studied for genes relating to high blood pressure and other genes that may be related to the risk of cardiovascular disease. The blood, urine and DNA samples may be stored and used for other similar studies by Dr. Harshfield, Dr. Harris and Dr. Dong. The genetic results from these studies will not be told to myself and will not be given to any doctor or other individual.",UNKNOWN,,2014-04-22,2019-11-30,2019-11,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,TRIPLE,PREVENTION,50,ESTIMATED

This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid body modulation therapy in hypertensive patients by external ultrasonic micro-bubble and also identify the association between CB volume and CB activity.,"Carotid body (CB) hyperactivity, with excessive afferent discharge signal to the respiratory centre anautonomic sympathetic nuclei, can result in hyperventilation and sympathetic hyperactivity. And previous studies have found that CB hyperactivity was common in several kinds of cardiovascular diseases and the investigators also found that CB was obviously enlargement in hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Hence, CB might play an important role in the development of these cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, Resection of CB or blockade of P2X3 receptors in CB significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in patients with hypertension. Therefore, CB may be a promising therapeutic target for hypertension. However, the following questions about CB are needed to be addressed urgently. First, the CB volume enlargement may be a promising indicator for selection appropriate patients for CB modulation therapy, but its relationship with the CB hyperactivity is still unclear. Second, although CB resection could significantly reduce BP in hypertensive patients, but the invasive therapy and completely resection may result in severe adverse events.

The efficacy of different medication classes is well understood as their IOP lowering effects have been well documented. However, beyond the basic biochemical and pharmacokinetic actions, long-term effects of these drugs on IOP have not been adequately studied. Specifically, does long-term use of anti-glaucoma medications have lasting effects on IOP even with subsequent discontinuation of the medication? In Ontario, prostaglandin analogues are the most frequently prescribed first line anti-glaucoma medication. In our study, we examine the lingering IOP-reducing effects of the prostaglandin analogue anti-glaucoma drug class. Our overall objective is to determine if patients previously treated with prostaglandin analogues remain within acceptable treatment ranges 6 weeks after medication discontinuation, and if this IOP differs from pre-treatment baseline values. Half of participants will discontinue their prostaglandin analogue (PGA) treatment for 6 weeks, while the other half will continue their PGA therapy as prescribed by their ophthalmologist. Both groups will be followed closely throughout the 6 weeks to monitor changes in IOP. This can help us understand the lasting effects of medication use and can help better guide clinical care in optimizing glaucoma management, and help direct study designs of future research that involve any therapy secondary to prostaglandin analogue treatment.","Quality assurance plan: Paper copies of all registry data is securely stored at the site of data collection.

Data Checks and Source Data Verification: Data is monitored closely and re-assessed frequently by multiple members of the research team to ensure the accuracy of the Master data excel sheet. Registry data will be compared to paper registry copies and patient medical records to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Standard Operating Procedures:

All patients currently being seen by Dr. Hutnik (\~6000) will have their charts reviewed. Personal information will be recorded to allow research staff to contact eligible participants. Clinical information recorded includes: diagnosis, intraocular pressure (IOP) at baseline, IOP at subsequent follow up visits with medication use, medication history, surgical and laser intervention history, visual acuity at baseline and follow-up visits, and visual field mean deviation. Patients fulfilling the inclusion and having none of the exclusion criteria are contacted via telephone by the research staff to invite them to participate in the trial. If they are interested, participants are met with in-person and provided with an information package including a form of consent. Research staff provide detailed description of this study's protocol, risks, and benefits for the patient prior to obtaining informed consent. Patients are also provided with the research teams' contact information should they have any questions or concerns. As part of the information package, participants receive notice that should they experience worrisome signs and symptoms, they should contact their ophthalmologist's office immediately. Following enrolment, participants are given an enveloped that randomizes them two either the control group (continues their eye drop medications) or experimental group (temporarily discontinues eye drop medications). In order to eliminate measurement bias, this allocation is concealed to research staff until completion of the trial. Participants' IOP is measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry at day of allocation (Day 0) and subsequently 7, 21, and 42 days after. In addition, should their IOP increase back to baseline levels prior to their final day of pressure measurement, participants are asked to restart their eye drops and are closely followed to ensure their IOPs return back to their pre-study values. Paper copies of participant signed consent and information form are stored in the research database. Once the assessment is complete, all participants will be debriefed on the nature of the study and potential findings. At the end of trial, participants will resume standard therapy according to Canadian Ophthalmology Society (COS) 2009 Glaucoma Guidelines.

Power analysis using a General Linear Multivariate Model for Power and Sample Size (GLIMMPSE) found that a total patient N value of 87 (154 eyes) was sufficient power for our study

Missing Data: All missing data is documented in the Master data record and will be reported. Participants with missing baseline (pre-treatment) IOP values are excluded from the study. Within-study missing IOP values are accounted for in statistical analysis.

Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis is performed on R. Data is analyzed using a linear mixed effects model fit by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) t-tests with Satterthwaite approximations to compare mean intraocular pressure between control and washout groups at day 0, 7, 21, and 42.",COMPLETED,,2014-05-27,2017-06-22,2017-06-22,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,87,ACTUAL

NCT05126082,PedsBP Clinical Decision Support Tool,Improving Recognition and Management of Hypertension in Youth: Comparing Approaches for Extending Effective CDS for Use in a Large Rural Health System,The goal of the PedsBP CDS research project is to adapt a previously tested web-based clinical decision support tool that appropriately identifies high blood pressure in youth for use in a primarily rural health system and compare approaches to CDS implementation in 45 primary care clinics treating children in 3 upper Midwest states. This project will advance implementation science and address a critical need for youth at risk for cardiovascular disease and with limited access to pediatric subspecialty care.,"Hypertension (HT) in youth tracks into adulthood, contributing to adult cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HT in children and adolescents were last updated in 2017, with definitions for HT that vary by age. To date, most children and adolescents with elevated blood pressure (BP) or HT are not diagnosed or inadequately treated. Factors that contribute to these deficits in care include: the need to translate pediatric BP measures into BP percentiles, lack of clinician familiarity with pediatric HT guidelines, and competing demands at clinical encounters.

Electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) can be used to address these barriers and improve the identification and management of elevated BP and HT in children and adolescents. In a previous study, the investigators developed, implemented, and evaluated a sophisticated web-based, EHR-linked CDS to provide patient-specific clinical care recommendations in real time and in accordance with national guidelines for BP management in youth. In a 2-year cluster randomized trial in 20 urban and suburban primary care clinics in an integrated health system in Minnesota, the investigators demonstrated that the CDS increased repeat measurement of elevated BP during a visit and more than doubled clinician recognition of HT, while promoting dietitian referrals and additional next steps in care consistent with national guidelines. The CDS system was well accepted by providers and as such, is now standard of care in 55 primary care and 17 subspecialty clinics serving children across our health system. Implementation of this CDS in a new health system is a logical next step, yet optimal strategies for adaptation and implementation of CDS in clinics serving rural populations have not been well described.

In this study, the investigators will implement PedsBP CDS in a large health system with many clinics located in rural regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. In order to compare approaches to implementation of PedsBP CDS to usual care, the investigators will randomly assign 15 primary care clinics to receive high-intensity implementation (CDS with online and in-person training, and audit-feedback), 15 clinics to receive low-intensity implementation (CDS with online training only), and 15 clinics will continue with usual care (no CDS).",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2022-08-01,2025-07-31,2024-01-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,41263,ACTUAL
NCT04414982,An Intervention to Increase Engagement With Hypertension Care for American Indian Patients,An Intervention to Increase Engagement With Hypertension Care for American Indian Patients,"The objective of this study is to reduce the effects of stereotype threat on the adherence of American Indian/Alaska Native patients with hypertension.

The specific aims of this study, which employs a values affirmation intervention, are to:

1. Compare the effects of the values-affirmation exercise with a control exercise in AI/AN patients with hypertension.
2. Compare the effects of the values-affirmation exercise in AI/AN patients with its effects in white patients.","American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) in the U.S. bear a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease. They have a higher prevalence of conditions that predispose to cardiovascular disease and poorer outcomes after developing cardiovascular disease than white Americans. The causes of these differences are complex and multiple, but there are widespread concerns that racial bias contributes to the problem. As concluded over a decade ago in the 2003 Institute of Medicine report, Unequal Treatment, ""Racial/ethnic disparities in health care occur in the context of broader historic and contemporary social and economic inequality and evidence of persistent racial and ethnic discrimination... Bias, stereotyping and prejudice on the part of healthcare providers may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care."" These concerns persist. Minority group members are well aware of negative stereotypes targeted at them as a group and of the possibility of bias directed at them as individuals. Given the reality of prejudice and their previous experiences with it, it is understandable that minority group members would be apprehensive about the possibility of being judged in light of the stereotype, both outside and inside the healthcare system. Critically, this apprehension may occur in the absence of actual bias. This raises the possibility that interventions directed at patients' perception of discrimination may have an independent and additive effect beyond the effects of interventions directed at provider bias.

Investigators propose to evaluate a novel intervention that reduces the detrimental effects of negative stereotypes on minority patients by reducing stereotype threat through values- affirmation. Stereotype threat is a stressful psychological state that occurs when a person fears being judged in light of negative stereotypes. The stress of this situation and the pressure to avoid confirming negative stereotypes can result in impaired performance and worse outcomes - something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, an American Indian patient fearful of confirming the stereotype of being unintelligent may fail to ask for clarification of changes in antihypertensive medications and, based on misconceptions, persist in taking an old regimen that is ineffective. Values-affirmation is a process in which global sense of personal worth is strengthened in the face of a threat, making individuals better able to cope with psychological threats.

The intervention proposed in this application is based on one found to be effective in alleviating stereotype threat in other contexts such as education and in alleviating more general threats to the self in a health context as well as in a prior study investigators performed with African American patients. Investigators will randomly assign AI/AN patients with hypertension to complete an affirmation exercise or a control exercise prior to a visit with their providers. The affirmation exercise is performed immediately before a clinic visit. It asks patients to reflect on values or self-defining skills that they find important, and to write a few sentences about why one of them is important. The project is innovative in that it is directed against a mechanism, stereotype threat, not generally recognized as important in healthcare settings. Since the intervention is brief and easily applied across a wide range of health conditions, it directly addresses the need for interventions to be generalizable and sustainable.",COMPLETED,,2015-09-01,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,339,ACTUAL
NCT04190420,"The Transition From Hypertension to Hypertensive Heart Disease and Heart Failure, the PREFERS Hypertension Study","The Transition From Hypertension to Hypertensive Heart Disease and Heart Failure, the PREFERS Hypertension Study","AIMS Despite evidence-based therapeutic approaches, target blood pressure is obtained by less than half of patients with hypertension. Hypertension is associated with a significant risk for heart failure (HF), in particular HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although treatment is suggested to be given early after hypertension diagnosis, there is still no evidence-based medical treatment for HFpEF. We aim to study the underlying mechanisms behind the transition from uncomplicated hypertension to hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and HFpEF. To this end, we will combine cardiac imaging techniques and measurements of circulating fibrosis markers to longitudinally monitor fibrosis development in patients with hypertension.

METHODS In a prospective cohort study, 250 patients with primary hypertension and 60 healthy controls, will be characterized at inclusion, and after 1 and 6 years. Doppler-echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and ECG will be used for measures of cardiac structure and function over time. Blood biomarkers reflecting myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction will be analysed. As a proxy for HFpEF development, the primary endpoint is to measure echocardiographic changes in LV function and structure (E/e´ and LAVI) and to relate these measures of LV filling to blood pressure, biomarkers, ECG and CMR.

CONCLUSION We aim to study the timeline and transition from uncomplicated hypertension to HHD and HFpEF. In order to identify subjects prone to develop HHD and HFpEF, we want to find biomarkers and cardiac imaging variables to explain disease progression. Ultimately, we aim at finding new pathways to prevent HFpEF.","INTRODUCTION Hypertension is common with a prevalence of approximately one third of the adult Swedish population and similar figures reported world wide. It is associated to cardiac structural- and functional changes as well as vascular dysfunction which all can be delayed or reversed by appropriate antihypertensive treatment. Although blood pressure (BP) control is improving, target BP is still reached by less than half of the treated patients. Hypertension is the single risk factor with the greatest attributable risk for incident heart failure (HF) and is considerably more common in HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF) than in HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). In patients with established HFpEF hypertension is very common, ranging between 50-70%. However, the exact mechanisms for the transition from hypertension to hypertensive heart disease and HFpEF are less well understood. In contrast, pathophysiology and progression of HFrEF is better elucidated and may successfully be reversed by 7-8 evidence-based treatments.

The evolution of myocardial fibrosis may be one early important mechanism in the transition from hypertension to HHD, and subsequent heart failure. This can be studied through the recent development of cardiac imaging with advanced Doppler-echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and assessment of circulating biomarkers reflecting myocardial fibrosis turnover, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, echocardiographic left chamber longitudinal strain and extracellular volume measured by CMR have recently been demonstrated to be useful to discriminate between healthy controls, patients with hypertension and patients with HFpEF. Also circulating plasma biomarkers reflecting altered myocardial tissue turnover can differentiate patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) from patients with LVH and HFpEF. In addition, biomarkers may identify phenotypes of high collagen cross-linking which has been suggested to have impact on the response to medical treatment in HFpEF.

An increased understanding of these mechanisms allows the development of specific treatments, guided by cardiac imaging and/or biomarker assessments, to delay or prevent the transition from hypertension to HF. This may have considerable clinical implications in reducing cardiovascular complications to hypertension. Thus, the aim of the present study is to characterize and study the timeline and the transition from uncomplicated hypertension to HHD and HFpEF in subjects with primary hypertension using advanced cardiac imaging techniques and bioinformatics, Table 1. Furthermore, we aim to compare changes of HFpEF variables and biomarkers in this study to patients with new onset symptomatic HFpEF in the Stockholm PREFERS Heart failure study, see below.

Table 1.

HYPOTHESES:

1. Hypertension with normal left atrial/ventricular function deteriorates over time, starting with increasing filling pressure, left atrial enlargement followed by reduced global longitudinal strain with LVEF\>50% and heart failure symptoms (HFpEF)
2. Circulating biomarkers reflecting myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction reflects the transition from hypertension to hypertensive heart disease and HFpEF

As a proxy for HFpEF development our OVERALL AIM is to investigate:

if change in diastolic cardiac function E/e' or left atrial volume index (LAVI) after one year is associated to blood pressure at baseline.

SPECIFIC AIMS:

1. to study if change in diastolic cardiac function measured with E/e' or LAVI after one year is associated to change in blood pressure from baseline to one year.
2. to assess if blood pressure control at baseline (according to guidelines and age adjusted) is associated to diastolic cardiac function measured with E/e' or LAVI after one year.
3. to investigate if blood pressure control after one year (according to guidelines and age adjusted) is associated to diastolic cardiac function measured with E/e' or LAVI after one year.
4. to study the temporal evolution (baseline, one year, six years) of the diastolic function measured with E/e' or LAVI.
5. to investigate gender aspects on the temporal evolution (baseline, one year, six years) of the diastolic function measured with E/e' or LAVI.
6. to study the temporal evolution (baseline, one year, six years) of the diastolic function measured with echocardiography and CMR.
7. to assess if temporal changes (baseline, one year, six years) in circulating levels of biomarkers reflecting myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are associated with changes in blood pressure.
8. to assess if temporal changes (baseline, one year, six years) in circulating levels of biomarkers reflecting myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are associated with changes in diastolic function.

METHODS

STUDY DESIGN The study PREFERS Hypertension, is the last part of the PREFERS (Preserved and Reduced Ejection Fraction Epidemiological Regional Study in Stockholm, Clin trial NCT03671122), a clinical trial first aiming at describing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in new onset HF, either HFpEF or HFrEF with approximately 600 patients. PREFERS Hypertension study is a single-centre, prospective clinical cohort study performed in collaboration between the Department of Cardiology at Danderyd Hospital and the Primary Health Care Services in Stockholm, Sweden. The study will recruit patients with a diagnosis of primary hypertension with an ongoing antihypertensive drug treatment as well as healthy control subjects, for comparison as previously described. For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see below. All subjects will be assessed at the Cardiovascular Research Laboratory, which is part of the Clinical Research Centre at Danderyd University Hospital.

Primary hypertension is defined as a diagnosis documented in primary care at some time point within the last 24 months and ongoing antihypertensive drug treatment (maximum up to 2-3 drugs). The currently recommended definition of hypertension as a systolic office BP \>140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP \>90 mmHg(19) is widely adapted in primary health care. Exclusion of secondary hypertension is at the discretion of the primary health care physician or may be excluded at the inclusion visit. Controlled hypertension is defined as \<140/90 mm Hg.

RECRUITMENT OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND TIMELINE Hypertension in Sweden is usually managed at primary health care centers. Through a collaboration between hospital and primary care, the patients will be recruited from health care centers in various socioeconomic areas in Stockholm (approximately 10 care centers, total catchment area of 100 000 inhabitants). To include 250 patients and with an expected response rate of 25-30%, each health care center will identify and randomly select and invite 100 patients, gender 1:1 using the software MedRave4 (Medrave Software AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Patients will be characterized at baseline, after 1 and 6 years per standardized protocol, and they will have their medication optimized at baseline and follow-ups, according to ESC/ESH 2018 guidelines. Parallel with patient recruitment, healthy control subjects, matched in age and gender will be recruited by advertisement in local newspapers. Inclusion will be performed following a telephone interview, confirming they are apparently healthy and have no daily medication. Control subjects will follow the same study protocol as the patients but planned to be examined at inclusion only. The study protocol has been approved by the regional Ethics committee and the Stockholm Health Care services, and all study participants will give their written informed consent.

MEASUREMENTS All study data will be collected into electronic case report forms (eCRF) using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).

BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS AND PULSE WAVE VELOCITY Seated BP measurements will be made in accordance to current ESC/ESH 2018 guidelines. Three consecutive BP measurements are recorded, 1-2 min apart, using an oscillometry device (Omron M3 Comfort, OMROM Healthcare Co., Ltd. Kyoto, Japan). BP will also be measured 1 min and 3 min after standing from a seated position, to assess orthostatic hypotension. To screen for lower extremity artery disease an ankle-brachial index will be recorded, using continuous wave Doppler.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) during 24 h will be assessed by a Spacelabs ABP monitoring 90217A device (Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, WA, US), programmed to record BP at 20 min intervals to provide an average BP value for day-time, night-time and 24h. A diary of the patients´ activities and sleep-time will be recorded. A minimum of 70% useable BP recordings are required for a valid ABPM session. The diagnostic threshold for hypertension is according to ESC/EHS 2018 guidelines. The carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) is assessed by the SphygmoCor XCEL device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia), which allows for non-invasive assessment of the central arterial pressure waveform and measures of aortic stiffness.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM 12 lead ECG data will be stored digitally (EC store version 4.1; Cardiolex Medical AB, Stockholm, Sweden). In harmony with the PREFERS HF study, LVH will be assessed according to the Sokolov Lyon index. In addition, beside a conventional 12-lead ECG we will analyse a resting 12-lead ECG that combines advanced and conventional ECG parameters within computerized ECG-scores which have been demonstrated to increase the detection accuracy of concentric LVH and in screening for LV systolic dysfunction.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC AND CMR MEASUREMENTS We will follow current recommendations for echocardiography to record two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler variables, and perform Doppler tissue imaging similar to those measured in the PREFERS HF study. All measurements will be presented as mean values of three cardiac cycles. A Vivid E9 (GE, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA) Ultrasound System will be used. To reduce interobserver variability only two sonographers will perform the investigations, which will be stored on a digital server, and will be analyzed offline.

For CMR, a Siemens Aera system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) will be used to deliver standard measurements of chamber dimensions and function, and signs of tissue scars of ischemic and non-ischemic origin. Myocardial extracellular matrix and signs of fibrosis will be examined by T1 mapping. Fully automated quantitative perfusion mapping during rest and adenosine stress will give a quantitative measurement for perfusion in mL/min/g, which will be used to search for perfusion defects; both focal defects due to obstructive coronary artery disease and defects in the global myocardial perfusion reserve due to coronary microvascular disease.

MEASUREMENTS QUESTIONNAIRES Quality of life measurements are to be assessed with validated instruments; the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), the Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ-12) and the Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire (MLHFQ). To screen for excessive daytime sleepiness, we will use the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) version 1.0.

SCREENING FOR OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Screening for sleep disorders and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is performed at inclusion by the Somnocheck micro CARDIO (Weinman, Hamburg, Germany), self-applied by the study participants at home before bedtime. The ambulatory overnight cardio-respiratory polygraphy recording will measure apnea/hypopnea-, desaturation- and arousal indices.

PERIPHERAL VENOUS BLOOD- AND URINE SAMPLING Peripheral blood and urine will be collected after overnight fasting with no ingestion of caffeine or nicotine within at least 12h. Clinical routine analyses of plasma and urine will be performed directly, but for future analysis of biomarkers and DNA extraction, aliquots of whole blood, plasma and serum will be stored at -80 degrees C in the Stockholm Medical Biobank until further analysis. This ensures a standardized handling of biomaterial with high security and traceability also for long-term storage. In the PREFERS Hypertension study we plan to analyze the same panel of biomarkers as for the PREFERS HF study(17), which will enable a comparison between the two cohorts. Here, we focus on biomarkers indicative of various pathophysiological mechanisms relevant to HFpEF, including those reflecting myocardial fibrosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Fibrosis i.e: Collagen split products PICP, CITP-I, sST2, Galectin-3, MMPs and IGFBP2; Inflammation i.e: HsCRP, IL-6, E-selectin, TNF-alfa, YLK-40, GDF15; Endothelial dysfunction i.e: ICAM-1, VCAM-1, Allantoin, SDMA, ADMA, Calprotectin, Arginin, von Willebrand factor, EMPs.

OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality data outside hospital and incident admission to hospital due to heart failure will be obtained by merging the Swedish cause of death register and the Swedish national inpatient register. The unique personal identification number of all Swedish citizens will ascertain complete follow-up.

PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND STATISTICAL POWER As a proxy for HFpEF development our overall aim is to investigate if change in diastolic cardiac function E/e' or left atrial volume index (LAVI) after one year is associated to blood pressure at baseline. Therefore, the primary endpoint in this study is, either mean change of E/e' of 2 or more, or mean change of LAVI of 4 mL/m2 or more after one year. These assumptions are based on a cross-sectional analysis of a big cohort from Olmsted County, Minnesota, where clear-cut differences were shown for these echocardiographic variables in patients with hypertension, HFpEF and healthy controls. To reach 80% power at a 2-sided level of significance of 0.05 the present study is planned to recruit 250 patients and 60 healthy controls, including 20% drop outs.",ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,,2018-10-01,2025-12,2025-12,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,310,ESTIMATED

NCT01051739,Variability in Perimetry Study,Improved Assessment of Visual Field Change,"Improved Assessment of Visual Field Change is a trial aimed at investigating mechanisms of visual field testing variability. The investigators have found using larger stimulus size substantially lowers short-term variability. In this study, the investigators will determine if larger stimuli detect visual field change at an earlier time. The investigators are also developing a statistical model that accounts for correlations of neighboring test locations.","Disease of the optic nerve, including glaucoma, is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Treatment decisions for optic nerve diseases are based largely on the changes in visual function that occur mostly as a consequence of disease progression. Unfortunately, the decision as to whether change of visual function has occurred is often difficult because of the high retest variability of conventional visual field testing (perimetry). This variability is so high that with moderate visual loss, a minimum of six tests are often needed in patients with optic nerve damage to reliably distinguish visual field deterioration from random variation. The preliminary data show that a substantial portion of the variability of perimetry lies in the type of stimulus used and the testing strategy applied.

OBJECTIVES: The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that a large portion of total perimetric variability in patients with visual loss is due to a poor signal-to-noise ratio associated with using a small fixed-size stimulus.

RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the investigators are examining patients with optic nerve diseases with conventional automated perimetry (size III) and tests having large-sized and scaled stimuli (size V, size VI (custom perimeter) and luminance size threshold perimetry - a test where threshold is found by changing stimulus size rather than stimulus intensity). Over four years the investigators will test 100 patients with and glaucoma and 60 normals each eight times. In addition, the investigators are retesting 50 subjects once a week for 5 weeks. The investigators are also studying the associated structural-functional correlations using OCT and developing a statistical model that accounts for correlations of neighboring test locations.

Perimetric variability and the reliable identification of visual field change is the single most difficult problem in visual testing today. The investigators anticipate identifying a method that allows efficient and accurate determination of visual field change. Identification of a superior method would (1) reduce the number of examinations needed, thereby reducing the costs of medical care; (2) minimize misdiagnosis, unnecessary testing and even unnecessary surgery that results from mistakenly interpreting fluctuation of the visual field as progression or improvement; (3) allow earlier disease intervention and (4) reduce the costs of clinical trials.",COMPLETED,,2010-07,2015-09,2015-09,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,180,ACTUAL

NCT01275339,Aortic Stenosis and PhosphodiEsterase Type 5 iNhibition (ASPEN): A Pilot Study,Aortic Stenosis and PhosphodiEsterase Type 5 iNhibition (ASPEN): A Pilot Study,"Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is considered a ""surgical disease"" with no medical therapy available to improve any clinical outcomes, including symptoms, time to surgery, or long-term survival. Thus far, randomized studies involving statins have not been promising with respect to slowing progressive valve stenosis. Beyond the valve, two common consequences of aortic stenosis are hypertrophic remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary venous hypertension; each of these has been associated with worse heart failure symptoms, increased operative mortality, and worse long-term outcomes. Whether altering LV structural abnormalities, improving LV function, and/or reducing pulmonary artery pressures with medical therapy would improve clinical outcomes in patients with AS has not been tested. Animal models of pressure overload have demonstrated that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition influences nitric oxide (NO) - cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in the LV and favorably impacts LV structure and function, but this has not been tested in humans with AS. Studies in humans with left-sided heart failure and pulmonary venous hypertension have shown that PDE5 inhibition improves functional capacity and quality of life, but patients with AS were not included in those studies. The investigators hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition with tadalafil will have a favorable impact on LV structure and function as well as pulmonary artery pressures. In this pilot study, the investigators anticipate that short-term administration of tadalafil to patients with AS will be safe and well-tolerated.","Subjects with moderately severe to severe aortic stenosis (AS), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, preserved ejection fraction, and no planned aortic valve replacement over the next 6 months will be eligible for this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study.

Sapropterin or placebo will be given for two weeks in patients with liver cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension. Systemic and hepatic hemodynamics studies will be performed at baseline and after the intervention to assess the effect of sapropterin.,"Portal hypertension and its complications (variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome) are the main cause of death and liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis. Diminishing portal hypertension by drugs (beta-blockers) is associated with a protection in the development of complications from portal hypertension. For this reason it is important to investigate and develop drugs that can reduce the portal pressure in liver cirrhosis. Tetrahydrobiopterin has been shown to decrease portal pressure in animal models of cirrhosis by improving intrahepatic resistance and by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability (eNOS co-factor). These effects were not associated to deleterious effects on systemic hemodynamics.

This study aims to test if sapropterin (an oral analogue of tetrahydrobiopterin) can play a role in the management of portal hypertension. For this, patients with liver cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension will be randomized to receive sapropterin or placebo for two weeks. Patients will undergo an hepatic vein catheterization to asses the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), and those having and HVPG of 10 mmHg or higher will be randomized to receive sapropterin or placebo. Swan-Ganz catheterization, systemic measurements, and hepatic blood flow by indocyanine green method will also be performed. Patients will receive sapropterin or placebo for two weeks at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/d in the first week, increasing to 10 mg/kg/d in the second week if there are no adverse events or intolerance. A second systemic and hepatic hemodynamic study will be performed after 2 weeks of treatment to assess changes.

Changes in laboratory tests, liver function (Child-Pugh and MELD scores), endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress markers (Von Willebrand Factor, Malondialdehyde) will be monitored during the study. As sapropterin has been never evaluated in cirrhotic patients, tolerance and adverse effects related to the medication will be registered.

In addition, following randomization experimental group will be treated with Rosuvastatin 40mg that will be administrated orally with or without food.

Control group will be treated with placebo.","Preeclampsia is a disorder of widespread vascular endothelial malfunction and vasospasm that occurs after 20 weeks' gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks' postpartum. It is clinically defined by as blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic and ≥90 mmHg diastolic diagnosed for the first time after 20 weeks' gestation together with \>300mg proteinuria/24 hours.

The global incidence of preeclampsia has been estimated at 5-14% of all pregnancies. Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 6-8% of all pregnancies worldwide. Pre-eclampsia affects 3-5% of all first time pregnancies, but early severe pre-eclampsia occurs in only 1:200 pregnancies.

Significant risk factors for pre-eclampsia are as follows: Nulliparity, age \>40 years, black race, family history, chronic renal disease, chronic hypertension, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes mellitus , multiple gestation and high body mass index.

Mild preeclampsia is defined as the presence of hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mm Hg) on 2 occasions, at least 6 hours apart, but without evidence of end-organ damage.

Severe preeclampsia is defined as the presence of 1 of the following symptoms or signs in the presence of preeclampsia:

marked elevation of blood pressure (\>160/110 mmHg), severe proteinuria (\>5 g/24 hours), or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (headaches, blurred vision, seizures, coma), renal dysfunction (oliguria or creatinine \> 1.5 mg/dL), pulmonary edema, hepatocellular injury (ALT \> 2-fold the upper limits of normal), hematologic dysfunction (platelet count \< 100,000/L or DIC), or placental dysfunction (oligohydramnios or severe intrauterine growth restriction). The HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is a special subgroup of severe preeclampsia and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

Eclampsia is defined as seizures that cannot be attributable to other causes in a woman with preeclampsia.

The optimal management of a woman with preeclampsia depends on gestational age and disease severity Management of preeclampsia is challenging because it requires the clinician to balance the health of the mother and fetus simultaneously. Patients with mild preeclampsia are often induced after 37 weeks gestation. Before this, the immature fetus is treated with expectant management with bed rest, close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function, and careful fetal surveillance. For women with severe preeclampsia, induction of delivery should be considered after 34 weeks gestation unless the patient is eligible for expectant management in a tertiary hospital setting. The definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Anti-hypertensive drugs are essential for severe hypertension (≥160 mmHg systolic or ≥110 mmHg diastolic) for reducing the risk of cerebrovascular accidents. Intravenous Labetalol, Nifedipine or hydralazine are the drugs most commonly used to manage preeclampsia but there is insignificant evidence to indicate which drug is preferable..

Magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures Where immediate child-birth is not essential, a delay of 24 hours will allow steroids to be given to mature the baby's lungs, although a shorter duration may still be of benefit.

Preeclampsia is associated with short-term and long-term maternal and fetal complications. For the mother, it may lead to eclamptic seizures, stroke, intracranial bleed, uncontrolled hypertension, renal failure, and hemolysis. For the fetus, it may lead to intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, and the short-term and long-term complications of prematurity, as well as predisposition to adult cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Currently, there is no effective therapy to preeclampsia, and delivery remains the only approach to preventing maternal morbidity and mortality. However, this is usually achieved at the expense of premature delivery and its associated morbidities. Moreover, following the delivery, preeclampsia resolved slowly within days, exposing the mother to late complications and increasing treatment cost significantly.

To date, the exact etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown. However, evidence obtained in recent years, supports the theory that angiogenic imbalance is the end common pathway that leads to clinical preeclampsia. During normal pregnancy, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) promote pro-angiogenic state that regulates vascular tone and glomerular capillary health. In preeclampsia, these proteins are antagonized by excessive placental production of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), thereby creating angiogenic imbalance. After delivery, this imbalance resolves within hours to days correlating with the resolution of the disease. One of the observations that marked sFlt-1 as key player in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia was made in an animal model. It was demonstrated that preeclampsia can be induced in animal model by over expressing sFlt-1 alone. In their model hydrophilic statins treatment decreased sFlt-1 levels and up-regulated VEGF and PlGF levels. Most importantly, statins ameliorated preeclampsia symptoms by improving hypertension and proteinuria in the preeclamptic mice.

Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and used successfully in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Additionally, statins are known to mediate pleiotropic effects via improving endothelial function and attenuating inflammatory responses. Rosuvastatin is a hydrophilic statin, characterized by low permeability through membranes, as the placenta and blood-brain-barrier. In addition, Short treatment (hours to days) with this type of statin improved the outcome of patients during acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, contrast-induced nephropathy, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, emphasizing its preferential pleiotropic effects.

Currently, the food and drug administration classiﬁes all statins as pregnancy category X and discourages their use during pregnancy due to higher abortion rate and teratogenicity that were observed in animals exposed to hydrophobic statins during pregnancy. Evidence for teratogenicity of the hydrophilic statins was never reported probably due to their limited permeability across membranes. Since the use of statins after delivery is allowed, the present study will aim to evaluate whether Rosuvastatin may accelerates preeclampsia resolution following delivery and potentially reduce postpartum preeclampsia complications.",UNKNOWN,,2014-12,2016-07,2016-07,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,SINGLE,TREATMENT,100,ESTIMATED
NCT02024386,Efficacy Study of Riociguat and Its Effects on Exercise Performance and Pulmonary Artery Pressure at High Altitude,"The Effect of Riociguat on Gas Exchange, Exercise Performance, and Pulmonary Artery Pressure During Acute Altitude Exposure","During ascent to high altitude there is a physiologic response to hypoxia that results in an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure associated with decreased exercise performance, altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension, and high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Riociguat is a novel agent from Bayer Pharmaceuticals that has already demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, and it may prove to be beneficial in cases of altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension or HAPE. This research study, composed of 20 healthy volunteers ages 18-40 years, will attempt to mimic the decreased oxygen supply and elevated pulmonary artery pressures found in conditions of high altitude, allowing observation of the effects of riociguat and exercise on pulmonary arterial pressure, arterial oxygenation, and exercise performance. Prior to entering the hypobaric chamber, subjects will have radial arterial lines and pulmonary artery catheters placed to obtain arterial and pulmonary artery pressure measurements. Subjects will then enter the hypobaric chamber and perform exercise tolerance tests at a simulated altitude of 15,000 feet on an electrically braked ergometer (exercise bike) before and after administration of riociguat. If, after administration of riociguat and exposure to a simulated altitude of 15,000 feet, the exercise performance is improved and observed pulmonary artery pressures are lower than those measurements seen prior to administration of riociguat, this could lead to development of a prophylactic and/or treatment strategy for HAPE and high-altitude pulmonary hypertension. Statistical analysis will compare the variables of pulmonary artery pressure, radial arterial pressure, ventilation rate, cardiac output, PaO2, and work rate at exhaustion before and after administration of the drug riociguat. The investigator's hypothesis is that riociguat will decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve gas exchange and exercise performance at altitude.","Background and Significance:

Impairment of exercise performance during hypoxemia due to altitude exposure or lung disease is caused primarily by reduced oxygen delivery to the exercising muscles, due to the reduction in arterial oxygen content. This reduction in arterial oxygen content is due to reduced alveolar PO2 and ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch, and to some extent alveolar to end-capillary diffusion impairment. Ultimately, hypoxemia results in secondary diffuse pulmonary vasoconstriction (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, HPV), which in turn causes pulmonary hypertension. This secondary pulmonary hypertension is believed to worsen VA/Q mismatch, further reducing the PO2, suggesting that pharmacologic blockade of HPV could increase PO2 (e.g. during altitude exposure) and thus improve exercise performance. Reduction in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in individuals susceptible to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) could also facilitate both prevention and treatment of HAPE.

Sildenafil is commonly used to treat pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary hypertension that occurs due to altitude exposure, with variable success in treating cases of altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension and HAPE. Sildenafil works via blockade of blocks phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) in pulmonary arterioles, causing an increase in cGMP. When cGMP is activated by nitric oxide (NO) it induces vasodilatation, and indeed, sildenafil administration during altitude exposure does increase arterial oxygenation slightly. However, attempting to block HPV with sildenafil by using a pathway that requires NO can only be realized if there is sufficient NO available to produce cGMP. During hypoxia endogenous levels of NO are depleted due to impaired endothelial NO synthesis. This may explain the inconsistent effects of sildenafil when used to improve oxygenation and performance at altitude.

Endogenous concentration of unbound NO is actually quite low, and most of the biological effects of NO are mediated through formation of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) such as S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb). NO binds to hemoglobin in a PO2-dependent manner, forming SNO-Hb so that when PO2 is low, NO-Hb binding is less avid and SNO-Hb is depleted. Depletion of SNO-Hb during hypoxia has been proposed as a mechanism that augments HPV, and indeed hypoxia has been shown to induce low levels of SNO-Hb. It is quite possible that the reduction in available endogenous NO and depletion of SNO-Hb during hypoxia limits the effect of the cGMP mechanism by which sildenafil works. Thus, an agent which can activate cGMP during periods of hypoxia when NO and SNO-Hb are depleted should be more effective in treating altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension.

Riociguat is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase that bypasses the NO pathway and is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Riociguat exhibits a dual mode of action that i.) stabilizes the reduced form of the nitrosyl-heme complex, enhancing the NO-cGMP signaling pathway in the absence of endogenous NO and ii.) acts in synergy with endogenous NO by increasing sGC sensitivity to NO. Essentially, riociguat stimulates sGC to produce cGMP in the absence of NO, and it is a mechanism by which pulmonary vascular resistance could be attenuated during altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension. It has recently been shown to augment exercise performance and decrease pulmonary artery pressure in both primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) due to chronic thromboembolic disease. Lowering pulmonary artery pressure could improve pulmonary gas exchange and performance at altitude, which has significant implications for those living at altitude, conducting military operations, altitude trekkers and high-altitude rescue teams. Direct stimulation of sGC also represents a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for those susceptible to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) when current treatment modalities of nifedipine and sildenafil are ineffective and oxygen is unavailable. By itself or in combination with sildenafil, riociguat could produce a significant advance in exercise performance during altitude exposure and provide a substantial improvement over the current therapeutic options in the prevention and treatment of HAPE.

Design and Procedures:

This investigation will consist of 20 normal subjects. Medical screening will exclude cardiac and pulmonary disease, pregnancy and sickle cell disease/trait in African Americans.

Subjects will be instrumented with radial arterial lines and pulmonary artery catheters and will perform a VO2 max test on a bicycle ergometer in a hypobaric chamber at a simulated altitude of 15,000 feet.

Following the VO2 max test, subjects will return to ground level for a 3-hour rest period. At 90 minutes subjects will be administered riociguat 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg orally. Once study subjects are at therapeutic levels of riociguat (30 to 90 minutes after oral administration), they will repeat the VO2 max test at 15,000 feet. The dosing of riociguat will start at the lowest recommended individual dose (0.5 mg) for the first three subjects. If there are no side effects and no clinically important difference in either PAP (5 mmHg decrease in mean PAP) or PaO2 (5 mmHg increase) during exercise, then for the remaining subjects the dose will be increased to 1.0 mg.

During the incremental exercise test arterial and mixed blood samples will be analyzed for PO2, PCO2, pH, O2 saturation and hemoglobin. Exhaled gas will be collected continuously and analyzed for O2 and CO2 concentrations and exhaled volume. Cardiac output will be calculated using Fick. Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances will be calculated from the cardiac output and intravascular pressures.

Outcome measures will be VO2max, maximum mechanical work rate, pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures, cardiac output, oxygen delivery and arterial blood gases.

Benefits:

Further understanding of the mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction will aid in prognosis and treatment in conditions of increased pulmonary vascular resistance such as congenital heart disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and COPD, in addition to high-altitude pulmonary hypertension and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Furthermore, the current treatment modalities for HAPE have demonstrated variable and/or limited effectiveness, so riociguat could potentially be used to prevent or treat HAPE in susceptible individuals. Additionally, riociguat could substantially improve exercise performance in those who must operate in conditions of high-altitude, such as those conducting military operations or working in high-altitude rescue teams.",COMPLETED,,2014-01,2015-12,2015-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,28,ACTUAL

Endothelial dysfunction and impairment in coronary microcirculation is also observed in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk factors. However, the measurement of CFR has rarely been performed in hypertensive patients without CAD, because CFR could be invasively measured using a Doppler guide wire in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.

Lipid lowering with a statin provided beneficial effects in patients with average levels of serum total cholesterol in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA) study conducted in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk. Improvements in endothelial dysfunction and CFR may be related to the beneficial effects of statins in hypertensive patients without hypercholesterolemia, but the effect of statins on CFR has not been examined in such patients. Accordingly, the investigators try to examine the hypothesis that pitavastatin added to standard antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk will be superior to placebo in improving CFR in a double-blind, randomized comparison study using Doppler echocardiography.",COMPLETED,,2014-05,2016-10,2016-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,85,ACTUAL
NCT01979822,LenusPro Safety (LPS) Study in Patients With PH,LPS (Lenus Pro Safety) - Study in Pulmonary Hypertension (PH),"The clinical study aims to investigate the numbers of predefined complications in the first six month after implantation of the implantable LENUS Pro® medications pump for intravenous application of treprostinil sodium in patients with PAH.

The manufacturer is Tricumed GmbH, Germany; exclusive marketing rights: OMT GmbH \& Co KG 78665 Frittlingen, Germany.","The previously used fully implantable pumps have been improved by development of additional safety options (e.g. acoustic occlusion alarm) for use in patients with PH. In the meantime, the pump (manufacturer: Tricumed GmbH, Germany, exclusively marketing rights: OMT GmbH \& Co KG, 78665 Frittlingen, Germany) is offered with an option that meets the requirements for use in treating PH patients. It is based on a constant flow system that consists of gas driven micro-infusion via a chip capillary. The medication is filled into a titanium reservoir via a so-called filling septum (silicon membrane). The membrane is punctured percutaneously with a special needle by specially trained personnel for filling under aseptic conditions. Various safety options ensure a continuous flow rate of the medication and signalize any malfunctions. If catheter occlusion is signalized, the catheter can be rinsed through a second septum in the pump after a percutaneous puncture without emptying the medication reservoir. The pump is available in two sizes (20 ml or 40 ml filling volume). The flow rate set for the 20 ml pump is 1.0 ml/ 24 hours, so that refilling is required every 19 to 20 days. The flow rate set for the 40 ml pump is 2.3 ml/ 24 hours, so that refilling is required every 29 to 30 days. Initial experience with the use of this pump has shown good results for up to 3 years of use (minor complications during implantation, no pump defects in long-term usage, reliable filling under outpatient conditions).

Experience shows that most of the patients selected for implantation have FC II-IV under combination therapy (2-3 specific PH-medications). The previous medication was either regarded as insufficient in respect to cardiopulmonary stabilization or the side effects of the therapy were intolerable. The latter applied particularly to patients with subcutaneous delivery of treprostinil in fairly large doses.

NCT00158639,Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring,Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring,"The control of blood pressure (BP) for patients with hypertension on medications has been elusive, despite the availability of evidence-based nationally recognized guidelines for treatment and 30 years of research addressing this. At present, less than 50% of patients with known hypertension are adequately controlled. If BP control could be improved, significant decreases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality would occur.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of the provision of home blood pressure measurement and electronic communications (secure messaging to health care providers) to improve hypertension control.","This is single-blind, randomized, controlled trial, to test the effectiveness of applying the chronic care model to hypertension.

There is an emerging consensus that multifaceted, multilevel, interventions are most effective in improving care for chronic conditions. In order to successfully plan and execute the required strategies, care planning is being increasingly conducted by the use of systems planning models. Since its original description by Wagner, Austin and Von Korff in 1996, the Chronic Care Model has found wide application, acceptance and success in planning care for chronic diseases, however to our knowledge, it has not yet been applied to the care of hypertension. There are six components of the model, including: clinical information systems, decision support, delivery system design, self-management support, organizational support, and community resources. The model describes these components to activate both patients and physicians, and when this occurs optimally, health outcomes improve. The interventions below are designed according to this construct and to determine whether enhanced patient self-management support in the form of home blood pressure monitoring and augmented delivery system design with pharmaceutical care improves hypertension control.

* Group-1 (Usual Care) will receive usual care for their hypertension. This includes the following for physicians: guidelines and decision support for treatment of hypertension, reminds and feedback as to medication choices, the use of electronic medical records with the ability to graphically display blood pressures over time. Patients have access to secure Intranet services already available at GHC including portions of their electronic medical record (including their blood pressures and the graphic display of these), messaging, and prescription refill services, and laboratory results.
* Group-2 (Blood Pressure Monitoring) will additionally receive home blood pressure monitors, instruction on their use, and a proficiency training session on Web-based communication and encouraged to use this to communicate their blood pressures with their physician, refill medications, and view parts of their medical records (blood pressures, labs, medication list).
* Group-3 (Blood Pressure Monitoring and Pharmaceutical Care) will receive all of the above plus planned and proactive, self and care management support provided by clinical pharmacists via the Web. One of three clinical pharmacists will be assigned to each patient in group 3. The clinical pharmacist will initially telephone the patient and do an intake visit to assess their medical history specific to hypertension care and assist the patient in designing an action plan that addresses blood pressure self-monitoring, medication use, lifestyle habits to reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk (they will assist the patient in choosing one lifestyle activity to work on), and follow-up plans. The pharmacist and patient will communicate at regular intervals by secure message (telephone and clinic visits will be occur if needed) and work collaboratively to improve blood pressure control. The pharmacist will use a medication algorithm (based on Group Health and JNC7 guidelines) to adjust medications until goal blood pressure is reached (\<135 mmHg and \<85 mmHg average for home BP measurements) and will provide information as to resources available within Group Health or the community to assist patients with their lifestyle goals. Record keeping will occur in the electronic medical record with key aspects shared electronically and securely with the patient and their physician.

The interventions will be delivered over a period of 12-months.",COMPLETED,,2005-06,2007-12,2007-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,778,ACTUAL

In the literature there are studies that relate the method to postural stabilization, joint rehabilitation, treatment of low back pain, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, studies on the modality\&#39;s potential for improving isokinetic and antihypertensive strength are scarce, particularly in post-stroke hemiparetic individuals with high blood pressure (BP). The objective of the study is to investigate changes in isokinetic strength and BP, in addition to functional capacity, balance, autonomic modulation, blood biomarkers and endothelial function in hemiparetic individuals due to stroke sequelae and/or with high BP (prehypertensive and hypertensive), after 12 weeks of training with Mat Pilates.

NCT02124486,An RCT of Bariatric Surgery vs a Community Weight Loss Programme for the Sustained Treatment of IIH,A Randomised Controlled Trial of Bariatric Surgery Versus a Community Weight Loss Programme for the Sustained Treatment of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: the IIH:WT Trial,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition with an unknown cause or causes. The condition is associated with raised pressure in the brain and can cause disabling daily headaches and loss of sight, which can be permanent. The raised brain pressure squashes the nerves supplying the eye (also known as papilloedema) and this can affect vision. Over 90% of patients with IIH are overweight and weight loss is the most effective treatment. Other treatments for IIH have very little current evidence to support their use.

Weight loss is difficult to maintain. This trial aims to compare two methods of weight loss, bariatric surgery and the most effective dietary programme commonly available, Weight Watchers, to see which offers the most effective sustainable treatment for IIH. Bariatric surgery is recommended by the NICE clinical guidelines for patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of over 40, or over 35 with a co-morbidity. Women suffering from IIH have a BMI on average around 38 and IIH is not recognised as a co-morbidity for bariatric surgery.

This trial will recruit 64 women with IIH from Neurology and Ophthalmology clinics in UK NHS Trusts. They will be randomised and 32 participants will be allocated to the dietetic intervention arm, and be enrolled in their local Weight Watchers group. 32 participants will be allocated to the bariatric surgery arm, and will be referred to their local bariatric surgery pathway to receive bariatric surgery. Both groups of participants will be allocated to a treatment arm which is proven to bring about weight loss.

Participants will then be followed up for five years, with the most important measurement being their brain pressure after one year of being in the trial.

A further 20 obese women who don't suffer from IIH will be recruited to compare the baseline symptoms and biomarkers of those with IIH; they will take no further part in the study. 5 further healthy individuals will be scanned twice in an MRI test group to validate the MRI scan sequence to be used in the trial.",,UNKNOWN,,2014-03-06,2022-08-02,2018-08-02,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,90,ESTIMATED
NCT04981886,Intraocular Pressure Reduction Efficacy of Rhopressa and Lumigan in Normal Tension Glaucoma,Intraocular Pressure Reduction Efficacy of Rhopressa and Lumigan in Normal Tension Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and the first leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. The intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor for all the spectrum of glaucoma. Reducing IOP in glaucoma increases the likelihood of preventing progression of the disease and preserving the quality of life of the patient. Although prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) and prostamides (PMs) are de facto first-line treatment options for managing glaucoma, it is a common clinical experience to see their treatment effects plateau to a level beyond which no clinically significant IOP reduction is likely. It is also common to find minimal IOP treatment effects in the following conditions: patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), patients with thicker central corneal thickness (CCT), and patients with higher levels of corneal hysteresis (CH). CH is a possible proxy for the ability of the scleral tissue around the optic nerve to dissipate energy away from the optic nerve fibers. Netarsudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. There is a paucity of research on the efficacy of netarsudil in patients with NTG, thicker CCT, and higher levels of CH. This study aims to investigate the above issues by evaluating the efficacy of netarsudil and bimatoprost in subjects with NTG, thicker corneas, and higher levels of CH.

Hypotheses

* Netarsudil will have non-inferior efficacy compared to Bimatoprost in treating NTG.
* Corneal thickness and corneal hysteresis will reduce the efficacy of netarsudil similar to bimatoprost in NTG.
* Netarsudil will change corneal thickness and corneal hysteresis similar to bimatoprost in NTG.","CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBJECT POPULATION

1. Target Accrual. The target number of participants we aim to recruit is one hundred and fifteen (115). Participants will be recruited from the patient base of Roberts Eyecare Associates in Vestal, New York, and from referrals from other practices.
2. Gender of the Subjects. There will be no gender restriction in the study.
3. Age Range of Adult Subjects. The age range of participants is 21 to 89 years. This age range is based on the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study (CNTGS).
4. Age Range of Pediatric Subjects. Not applicable.
5. Racial and Ethnic Origin. There will be no restriction based on race or ethnicity.
6. Vulnerable Subjects. It is not anticipated that the study will include vulnerable subjects like pregnant persons, breastfeeding persons, persons considering becoming pregnant, children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, Salus employees and/or students. However, if any subject meeting the inclusion criteria is determined to be a vulnerable subject as defined above, they will be excluded for participation.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES

1. Patient History

   The initial examination will include a comprehensive patient history that will include the following:
   * date of birth
   * race/ethnicity
   * ocular and general medical history
   * list of the medications
   * family ocular and general medical history
   * allergy history
   * social history, including history of smoking, alcohol, and recreational drug use.
2. Procedures at first visit

   1. Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA: Reichert ophthalmic instrument, Buffalo, NY, USA):

      This test will be used to automatically measure corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal corrected intraocular pressure (IOPcc), and Goldman equivalent intraocular pressure (IOPg). At least 5 readings will be taken and the highest 3 wave score readings above 6.5 will be averaged to get measurements for CH, CRF, IOPcc, and IOPg.
   2. Humphrey's Threshold Visual field test:

      The 24-2 threshold Humphrey's visual field analyzer with the sita standard algorithm will be used to determine the status of visual field for all participants. Three visual field tests will be conducted to ensure reliability and repeatability. Visual field test results with \> 33% fixation losses, \> 33% false positive, or 33% false negative errors will be excluded.
   3. Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) Test The SD-OCT is a medical imaging technique for acquiring high resolution images of the retina and optic nerve. This instrument emits a broad bandwidth, near infrared light from a super-luminescent diode onto the retina. Reflected light rays from the retina are analyzed by interferometry and Fourier-transformed into high resolution quasi-histologic images of the retina and optic nerve.
   4. Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy Slit-lamp examination of the eyes of all participants will be performed. The slit-lamp utilizes a beam of light and a pair of microscopes to aid in the detailed examination of the ocular tissues from the external parts of the eye, the adnexa, to the posterior aspect including the optic nerve and retina.
   5. Goldman Applanation Tonometry (GAT) Goldman Applanation Tonometry (GAT). Goldman applanation tonometry is a routine test for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP). It is a contact tonometer, therefore, 1 drop of the anesthetic, proparacaine will be used to numb the eye. Two GAT measurements will be taken. If the readings differ by more than 2 mmHg, a third measurement will be carried out. The principal investigator will be masked to the readings. A second optometrist (study optometrist 1) will record the IOPs and the average of two readings with a difference ≤ 2 mmHg will be taken.
   6. Dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) The DCT is a contact tonometer with a concave tip which has an electronic sensor. The radius of curvature of the tip is 10.5 mm. An electronic pressure sensor is integrated into the center of the contacting tip surface. When the tip of the DCT contacts the corneal surface, it conforms to the curvature of the tip. This allows the electronic sensor measure IOP independent of corneal properties. The measured IOP is displayed on the instrument. Two readings with the best quality scores will be averaged and recorded by a study optometrist 1. The principal investigator will be masked to the IOP readings. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by most tonometers typically have errors associated with corneal parameters like CCT, CH, and corneal curvature. The DCT will help overcome the influences of these corneal parameters on IOP measurement.
   7. Gonioscopy Gonioscopy is a procedure used to examine the anterior chamber angles of the eye. The procedure is carried out by means of a contact lens called the Gonio lens. Gonioscopy will be performed immediately after GAT. A drop of Proparacaine 1% may be added as needed to prolong local anesthetic effects. Gonioscopy will be used to rule out other forms of glaucoma like Angle closure glaucoma, Inflammatory glaucoma, pigmentary, and pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma.
   8. Dilated Fundus Examination (DFE) Pupillary dilation will be done with the instillation of 1% tropicamide in both eyes. Detailed examination of the anterior chamber, lens, vitreous, optic nerve, macular, retinal up to the periphery of the retina, will be performed. The purpose of the DFE is to establish the baseline ocular status and to rule out ocular diseases that may confound the findings of the study.
   9. Systemic blood pressure (BP) The BP of all participants will be measured using an automatic blood pressure measuring device. The ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) will be calculated by taking the difference of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the IOP (OPP = SBP - IOP). Arterial pulse amplitude (APA) will be calculated by taking the difference of the SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) (APA = SBP - DBP).
3. Adherence to treatment

   In order to monitor adherence to treatment, participants will be given a calendar log to write in the number of drops instilled, the date and time of instillation.
4. Follow-up visit schedule:

   Follow-up visits after the onset of treatment will be 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months after the onset of treatment. Please see below for what data will be collected for these follow-up visits.
5. Procedures to be carried out at follow-up visits The following procedures will be carried out at all the follow-up visits outlined above.

   * Assessment of participants' logbook to ensure adherence to treatment. Level of adherence will be quantified based on the number of drops, and days missed.
   * A traditional paper survey will be used to assess possible adverse events.
   * Slit lamp examination to elicit any signs of adverse events and signs of disease progression.
   * GAT to measure IOPs.
   * ORA to measure CH, CRF, IOPcc, and IOPg.
   * DCT to measure IOP and OPA.
6. Statistical analysis and sample size calculation

   a. Intent-to-treat analyses (ITT) This protocol shall follow the ITT analyses. All participant data shall be analyzed in the original treatment assignment even if they discontinue study mid-way or change treatment assignments.

   Two sample size calculations were performed. The first was for non-inferiority between netarsudil and bimatoprost. The second was for a sub-group analysis of the effect of corneal thickness and CH on the efficacy of both drugs. Since the sub-group analysis yielded the highest sample size, details were presented here. Subjects were classified into 2 CCT sub-groups (thin corneas: ≤ 540 µm, thick: \> 540 µm) based on the classification scheme used by Johnson et al (2008). The change in IOP in those with thin corneas treated with netarsudil will be compared to those with thin corneas treated with Lumigan. The same comparison will be made for those with thick corneas. An effect size of 2.4 mmHg was used based on derivation from a SD of 3.0. Assuming a power = 80%, and an alpha = 0.05, the calculated sample size was 26. Since we have 2 groups (thin and thick corneas) with 2 treatment arms (netarsudil and bimatoprost), the total calculated sample size for the 4 groups was 104. A 10% increase was added to the calculated sample size to account for attrition. The total sample size needed to detect the effects of all the aims of research is therefore 115.
7. Data Storage and Confidentiality.

   1. Data Storage:

      Hard copies of data including OCT, Visual field, Ocular Response Analyzer printouts will be collected and kept in the individual participant record folder. All individual record folders will be stored in secure, locked metal cabinets. All digital data will be stored in a password-protected computer. All data will be made available to the Salus University Institutional Review Board (IRB) upon request. The analysis of the data for presentation will only show participants ID and age.
   2. Data management:

   All data shall be kept in the Essential document folder, and pertinent data from all individual participant forms shall be stored in a safe, password-protected computer. All individual participant data will further be aggregated in a spreadsheet, de-identified, and made ready for analysis.
8. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT

   1. Potential Risks. The risks involved in the intervention are the same risks patients are normally exposed to in clinical practice with the treatment of NTG.

      Expected risks with the use of netarsudil and bimatoprost include conjunctival hyperemia, redness, stinging or burning sensation, and dry eyes. Changes in iris pigmentation could result from the use of bimatoprost.
   2. Risk Classification. The overall risk classification for the study is minimal and not greater than what is normally experienced in clinical practice. This definition of minimal risk is in accordance with the Health and Human Services/Food and Drugs Administration (HHS/FDA) Regulations which classifies minimal risk as ""the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.""
   3. Protection Against Risks. The safety of treatment will be assessed at every visit with a patient interview and a thorough eye examination. The study does not have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). However, all adverse events will be promptly reported to the Salus University IRB.
   4. Potential Benefits to the Subject. The study protocol involves the treatment of NTG with standard FDA-approved medical treatment for glaucoma. This is necessary to prevent progression of the disease.
   5. Potential Benefits to Society. This project may provide evidence for a more efficacious treatment of NTG. Secondly, it may provide evidence for the adequate control of IOP in NTG patients with thicker corneas, and or greater CH.
9. Therapeutic Alternatives. Many therapeutic alternatives exist for the study participants. These alternatives include, latanoprost, travoprost, latanoprostene bunod, combigan, timolol, dorzolamide, etc. The therapeutic agents used in this study, and other agents will also be available to any participant who chooses not to continue in the study but wishes to continue with the treatment.
10. Risk/Benefit Relationship. netarsudil and bimatoprost have been shown to be efficacious anti-glaucoma agents. These agents are already being widely used in clinical practice. The risks posed by these agents do not exceed that of alternatives. The benefits include reduction of IOPs, and reduction in the risk of progression of glaucoma. The benefits of this study therefore outweigh the potential risks.
11. Financial Compensation for Participation. Subjects who complete the 3 months of follow-up visit will receive a $20 Target gift card.
12. SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT, AND CONSENT Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment. Potential participants will be recruited from patients attending regular clinic at Roberts Eyecare Associates in Vestal New York. Flyers will be designed and handed to other eyecare practices announcing the clinical trial. All potential participants will undergo a complete eye examination to determine their eligibility for inclusion. All those meeting the inclusion criteria will be informed of the study. Those who agree to participate will be given an informed consent form to read. Only those who agree to participate after reading and demonstrating understanding of the entailments of the study and has duly signed, will be recruited.
13. Competing Protocols. After searching the National Institute of Health (NIH) registered clinical trials, at this time, there seem to be no competing protocol with substantial eligibility criteria as this study.
14. Subject Competency. All subjects are expected to be competent to give informed consent. If a subject who meets the eligibility criteria is not competent to give informed consent, an informed consent shall be sought from the participant's legal healthcare proxy.
15. Process of Informed Consent. Informed consent will be sought from all subjects to be recruited for the study. The inform consent will include a detailed explanation of the purpose of the study in a language that is accessible to a fifth-grade student. It will also include an explanation of the risks and benefits of the study interventions. Participants in the study will also be advised of expected adverse events they may experience. They will be informed of their rights to discontinue participation in the study at any time. A statement reassuring participants that treatment for glaucoma will continue even if they choose to leave the study, will also be included in the informed consent form. Only subjects who have received instructions on the study and have signed the informed consent form will be recruited for the study. The informed consent form will be filled at least two weeks before the commencement of the study.

    The consent form shall contain no statement penalizing subjects for non-participation, or statements absolving the study researchers of legal responsibilities in cases of severe adverse events or misconduct.
16. Subject/Representative Comprehension. All subjects or their legal representatives will be asked if they understand the content of the informed consent. If they confirm understanding they will be encouraged to explain, to the best of their understanding, what the study entails, and the content of the formed consent form. This will include, purpose of the study, procedures, potential risks, potential benefits, alternatives, and any other information pertinent to informed consent.

NCT06195839,Building Engagement Using Financial Incentives Trial - Hypertension,Building Engagement Using Financial Incentives Trial - Hypertension,"The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to determine feasibility and explore whether immediate versus delayed patient financial incentives improve patient engagement with self-monitoring of blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at Louisiana federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Do patients randomized to receive financial incentives on a weekly basis during the study (immediate) have better adherence to blood pressure self-monitoring compared to patients randomized to receive financial incentives at the end of the study (delayed)?
* Do patients randomized to immediate financial incentives have better blood pressure control compared to patients randomized to delayed incentives?

Participants will:

* attend a baseline visit to measure blood pressure, respond to a baseline survey, and receive remote patient monitoring devices and instructions to take home with them (home blood pressure monitor, wrist-worn sensor to track sleep activity, and associated apps)
* receive a random allocation to one of two groups: control condition (receive cash incentives at the end of the study for measuring blood pressure as instructed) or intervention condition (receive weekly cash incentives throughout the study for measuring blood pressure as instructed)
* use remote patient monitoring devices during a two month study period, receive weekly reports on adherence to blood pressure monitoring, and receive weekly financial incentives (intervention condition only)
* attend one follow-up visit at 2 months to measure their blood pressure, complete a follow-up survey, return the remote patient monitoring devices, and receive financial incentives for blood pressure monitoring (control condition only)

NCT05744986,Transcatheter Renal Artery Sympathetic Denervation Observational Study,The Systemic Effects of Transcatheter Renal Artery Sympathetic Denervation Using a Second- Generation Radiofrequency Ablation Catheter: A Multicenter Observational Study.,"Hypertension is a common health problem that affects millions of people in the world. Poorly controlled blood pressure (BP) leads to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal complications. Despite the availability of multitudes of anti-hypertensive drugs, the percentage of patients achieving optimal control of hypertension has remained disappointingly low.

Resistant hypertension (rHT) is defined as the failure to achieve target BP despite concurrent use of antihypertensive drugs of different classes, with one of them being diuretics. The reported prevalence of this condition ranged from 5 to 30%. Lifestyle modification, enhancing drug compliance, treating of secondary causes, or adding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone or eplerenone are well established strategies to treat resistant hypertension.

Besides factors such as, activated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and increased sympathetic outflow was thought to contribute to the development of rHT as well. Autonomic sympathectomy by way of endovascular renal denervation (RDN) was once a hopeful candidate as an adjuvant treatment for patients with rHT and it had shown signals of efficacy in early trials. However, the blood-pressure lowering efficacy was not demonstrated in the larger-scaled, randomized, sham- controlled SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial. One possible explanation of the lack of efficacy of RDN in this trial was the lower-than-expected BP responses in the RDN group and higher than-expected BP reduction in the control group which raised the speculation that some of the patients recruited were not true rHT as the trial intended to include. The suboptimal anti-hypertensive efficacy of RDN in HTN-3 was also partly attributed to the design of the first-generation RDN catheter, in which only a single electrode is deployed and might not offer sufficient sympathetic denervation as less than half of patients in the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 received 4 quadrants ablation.

The second generation SYMPLICITY RDN catheterTM has 4 times electrodes that are arranged in spirally in 90-degree intervals. Theoretically, the newer generation catheter can provide more efficient and extensive denervation in a shorter period of time. Its efficacy was confirmed in SYMPLICITY HTN ON-MED and OFF-MED trial, which confirmed a consistent and durable BP reduction that lasted into 36 months with or without adjuvant anti-hypertensive drugs.

BP reduction is only one of the effects of RDN. Previous observational studies of the first generation RDN catheter have shown an inconsistent effect of RDN in left ventricular (LV) remodelling, arrythmia modulation, arterial de-stiffening and quality of life. No report of these effects has been published with the newer generation catheter. Furthermore, vigorous efforts have been put into searching for clinical predictors that can identify patients in whom the BP reduction effect of RDN is most significant.

NCT03077386,"Enhancing Community Health Through Patient Navigation, Advocacy and Social Support","Enhancing Community Health Through Patient Navigation, Advocacy and Social Support","Some patients who have multiple long-term health conditions have significant challenges accessing needed services despite available primary care and social services resources. Patient navigation programs may help those with complex health conditions improve their care and outcomes and if delivered by community health navigators (CHNs) who have close community ties, these programs have the potential to reduce barriers to care and increase access to coordinated, person-centred care. The ENCOMPASS program aims to improve the care and health outcomes for high-risk patients by linking patients with chronic disease with a CHN to help them navigate the health system, facilitate communication between patients and providers, improve patients' understanding of their conditions and treatment plans, and support patients in their self-management. In Canada, patient navigation programs have not been well studied or broadly implemented in patients with chronic disease, making a comprehensive evaluation of ENCOMPASS important. This program has great potential to improve care for patients with chronic diseases in primary care.","Although non-communicable chronic disease is the leading cause of death in Canada, many patients with chronic diseases do not receive guideline-recommended therapy for a variety of reasons. Lack of awareness of publicly funded programs, financial constraints, personal circumstances, language and cultural barriers make it challenging for patients to follow recommendations. ENCOMPASS is a patient navigation intervention, delivered by community health navigators (CHNs), that will improve patient-centred care and outcomes by: helping patients navigate the health system, facilitating communication between patients and providers, improving patient understanding of their conditions and treatment plans, connecting patients with community resources and supporting patient self-management.

The ENCOMPASS intervention is based on an extensive literature review, and was refined in consultation with patients, operational partners, front-line care providers, and local and provincial policy makers. A pilot study has informed implementation, recruitment and data collection methods. This study will implement and test the intervention using a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial with a concurrent qualitative study. The objectives of this study are to determine the effectiveness of patient navigation, delivered by CHNs, in patients with multiple chronic diseases on: a) emergency department visits and hospital admissions over 12 months (primary outcome), b) patient-reported outcome and experience measures, and c) disease-specific clinical outcomes, compared with usual care. Additional objectives focus on practical aspects including understanding the experience of care from the patient and CHN perspective and factors influencing the intervention's ability to improve care and outcomes.

The effectiveness of ENCOMPASS will be studied using a parallel, two-arm, pragmatic, wait-list control, cluster-randomized trial (cRCT) in 16 clusters, with a target size of 1600 patients with chronic disease. If additional funding is realized the trial will be expanded to include additional clusters. Primary care practices with \~5 full-time physicians will be the cluster units and small practices of 2-3 physicians may be combined into one cluster. Half of the clusters will be randomized to receive the program immediately (Early Phase clusters), while the other half will be required to wait 6 months (Late Phase clusters). Randomization will be concealed, computer-generated and stratified by practice size. Although patients and providers cannot be blinded to the intervention, end-point evaluation will be blinded. The primary outcome will be assessed using administrative health data, eliminating risk of assessor bias. Control patients will receive usual care until the intervention is implemented in their clinic, at which time they will be eligible for the ENCOMPASS program.

Patients will meet with a research assistant at baseline, 6 and 12 months, with an additional 18 month follow-up for control patients, to assess clinical data, including weight, blood pressure, and patient-reported measures. Other endpoints (i.e., through administrative and laboratory data) will be assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Once implemented, the ENCOMPASS program will remain available to clinic patients until the end of the program funding period, which may be extended subject to budget decisions and preliminary results. A concurrent qualitative study will provide contextual information and will be used to make program refinements in the Late Phase, the impacts of which will be explored in a comparative analysis.",COMPLETED,,2018-06-08,2024-03-03,2023-03-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,176,ACTUAL

The project will establish a PAH subphenotype core cohort (CORE) to evaluate mechanistic pathways and test novel therapeutic agents. This core cohort serves as a resource for the Translational Program Project grant, Vascular Subphenotypes of Lung Disease (Mark Gladwin, PI). In order to construct the CORE, we have chosen to recruit COPD and HIV patients, two populations with advanced lung and systemic diseases that are enriched for PAH. We have selected these as prototypic conditions because: A) both COPD patients and HIV-infected patients develop PAH at a rate significantly greater than the general population, B) morbidity and mortality are greatly increased in dually-affected persons, C) mechanisms responsible for development of the PAH ""subphenotype"" are not well-understood, D) clinical and genetic characteristics of the subgroup with PAH are not known, and E) effects of PAH therapies in subphenotypes are incompletely studied. There is also some overlap between COPD and HIV, with HIV-infected patients having accelerated COPD even with effective antiretroviral therapy. Participants with COPD, HIV, or HIV-uninfected controls will be recruited to the study based on entry criteria of elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and/or an abnormal echocardiogram. These subjects will then undergo a 6-minute walk test, blood collection, questionnaire, medical record review, and echocardiography (if not previously performed). Selected subjects will then be recruited to undergo right heart catheterization.

NCT06712186,Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Hemodynamic Response to Endotracheal Intubation in Hypertensive Patients,Title: the Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Hemodynamic Responses to Endotracheal Intubation in Hypertensive Patients Undergoing Surgery,"Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, has been shown to provide several benefits during endotracheal intubation:

1. _Reduced anxiety and stress_: Dexmedetomidine's anxiolytic and sedative effects help reduce anxiety and stress associated with endotracheal intubation.
2. _Improved intubating conditions_: Dexmedetomidine can improve intubating conditions by reducing the incidence of coughing, bucking, and laryngospasm.
3. _Decreased hemodynamic responses_: Dexmedetomidine can attenuate the hemodynamic responses to intubation, including tachycardia, hypertension, and increased cardiac output.
4. _Increased ease of intubation_: Dexmedetomidine can facilitate smoother and easier intubation by reducing the need for additional anesthetics or muscle relaxants.

The physiological responses to dexmedetomidine during intubation include:

1. _Decreased heart rate_: Dexmedetomidine can cause a decrease in heart rate due to its effects on the sympathetic nervous system.
2. _Decreased blood pressure_: Dexmedetomidine can also cause a decrease in blood pressure due to its vasodilatory effects.
3. _Increased sedation_: Dexmedetomidine's sedative effects can help reduce anxiety and stress during intubation.
4. _Reduced respiratory rate_: Dexmedetomidine can cause a decrease in respiratory rate due to its effects on the respiratory centers in the brain.

The clinical benefits of dexmedetomidine during intubation include:

1. _Improved patient comfort_: Dexmedetomidine's sedative and anxiolytic effects can improve patient comfort during intubation.
2. _Reduced need for additional anesthetics_: Dexmedetomidine can reduce the need for additional anesthetics or muscle relaxants during intubation.
3. _Decreased risk of complications_: Dexmedetomidine's effects on hemodynamic responses and respiratory rate can decrease the risk of complications during intubation.","General anesthesia during surgery produces a state of controlled unconsciousness during which the patient is unaware and insensitive to pain. Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are mostly used to maintain airway while the patient is unconscious. Following the induction of anaesthesia, direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation are attributed to hemodynamic alterations brought on by sympathetic adrenergic outflow caused by laryngeal tissue stimulation, which may cause hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia, raised intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. The hemodynamic changes brought about by laryngoscopy and intubation were first described by Reid and Brace.This may be inconsequential in normal people but may lead to serious morbidity in patients with coexisting cerebrovascular or cardiovascular conditions.Patients undergoing treatment for hypertension have more pronounced hemodynamic responses to sympathetic stimulation.

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α-2 adrenoceptor agonist with a distribution half-life of approximately 6 minutes frequently used in anesthesia practice. With only minimal respiratory depression and cardiovascular stability, dexmedetomidine produces sedation, hypnosis, analgesia, anxiolysis, and sympatholysis. The central effects are due to the activation of α-2A receptors in locus coeruleus, and cardiovascular effects are due to a dose-dependent decrease in the central sympathetic outflow. The transient hypertensive response is seen initially due to its effects on α-2B receptors present in the vascular smooth muscle until there is a decrease in the central sympathetic outflow.

The study's main aim is to assess the effectiveness of using dexmedetomidine as a preventative measure to lessen the sympathetic response caused by tracheal intubation in hypertensive individuals.

The objective of the study is to compare mean attenuation of stress response between groups given dexmedetomidine versus Normal Saline among hypertensive patients undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation. We want to compare the effect of Dexmedetomidine on MAP at 5 minutes after laryngoscopy.

The study design is Prospective double blind Randomized Controlled Trial and will be conducted in Department of Anesthesia, Liaquat National hospital.

The 60 patients from Anesthesia Preoperative Clinic will be randomly allocated to 2 groups by using a closed-envelope method-a control group (group C) that will receive normal saline and a comparative group (group D) that will receive dexmedetomidine. Group D patients (n = 30) will be administer 0.5 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine (PrecedexTM; Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) intravenously over 10 min. Group C patients will be administer the same volume of normal saline (also intravenously for 10 min). Saline and dexmedetomidine will be administer using a syringe pump by an anesthesiologist unaware of the study protocol. After completing the saline or dexmedetomidine administration, Propofol (1.5-2.5mg/kg) titrated to effect and Atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) will be administer. Two minutes after these administrations, endotracheal intubation will be perform using a laryngoscope. All intubations will be performed within \<30 sec by one anesthesiologist. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) will be recorded in the ward just before departure to the operating room (baseline value), immediately after study drug administration, and at 1, 3, and 5 min after endotracheal intubation.The primary outcome is MAP at 5 min while HR, Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure are secondary outcome.

Data will be analyzed by using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. Normality will be checked by Shapiro w\\Wilk test.Stratification will be done with regards to age, weight and duration of hypertension, gender, comorbid other than hypertension and drug used as per need and post stratification independent t test/ Mann-Whitney U-test will be applied.

NCT04948086,Blood Pressure and Central Haemodynamics in Healthy Adults Stratified by MTHFR Genotype,Blood Pressure Lowering Effect of B-vitamins in Adults With a Genetic Pre-disposition to Elevated Blood Pressure.,"Approximately 12% of the world's population have a have a common C677T polymorphism in the gene encoding the folate metabolising enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Homozygosity for the polymorphism (TT genotype) appears to result in an increased requirement for the B-vitamins folic acid and riboflavin and more importantly results in an increased risk of developing high blood pressure (BP). Previous work from our Centre has demonstrated significantly higher BP in those with the TT genotype. This work has been conducted in cohorts with premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension without overt CVD, but the effect in younger, healthier individuals is unexplored. To date our studies have also focused on BP as the primary outcome, but newer markers of vascular health including central pressure and hemodynamics have emerged as superior prognostic indicators of CVD. The effect of the TT genotype on these measures is thus an important area for investigation and may help us understand the mechanism linking the genotype with BP, which is currently unknown. As adults with the TT genotype appear to have increased requirements for riboflavin and folic acid, and BP in TT adults appears to be riboflavin dependent, the influence of these vitamins on central measures is an area for consideration. Study Design This is an observational study investigating the blood pressure profiles of healthy adults aged 18-65 years, stratified by MTHFR genotype. Apparently healthy adults will be recruited from workplaces and the general community across Northern Ireland and screened for the polymorphism via buccal swab. Those with the TT genotype and a similar number of non-TT (i.e. CC/CT) genotype individuals will be contacted and asked to come to attend a one-off appointment. Brachial BP will be assessed by an electronic BP monitor, central BP and central haemodynamics (augmentation index, augmentation pressure and pulse wave velocity) will be assessed by SphygmoCor XCEL. In addition, anthropometric measurements, health and lifestyle information and a blood sample will be obtained.

Linear, quadratic and exponential regression models will be used to investigate relationship between GCIPLT and vessel density. Multilayer neural network will bel used to make single combined parameter and the diagnostic performance will be also compared.","This is a prospective, cross-sectional study. All recruited glaucoma patients and healthy subjects will be underwent a complete ophthalmic examination including measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), a slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy, funduscopy, biometry using the IOL Master (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA), and standard automated perimetry (SAP). Central corneal thickness (CCT) will be measured using ultrasonic pachymetry (Pachmate; DGH Technology, Exton, PA, USA). Keratometry will be measured with an Auto Kerato-Refractometer (ARK-510A; NIDEK, Hiroshi, Japan). All of the patients will be also examined using red-free RNFL photographs and optic disc stereoscopic photographs. Two different OCT exam will be performed to measure macular GCIPLT and macular vessel density, spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and swept source optic coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA), respectively.

\<Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Imaging\> The macular angiographic images will be obtained using a swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) device (DRI OCT Atlantis; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). SS-OCT uses infrared light, wavelength of 1050 nm which is longer than conventional SD-OCT, at 100,000 A-scans per second. This longer infrared light source has advantages of deep signal penetration through the retina and choroid. Its axial and transversal resolution is 7 and 20 μm in tissue, respectively. Volumetric OCT scans were taken from 6 × 6 mm cubes. Each cube consists of 320 clusters of 4 repeated B-scans centered on the fovea. Moving objects (mostly blood flows) are detected by measuring intensity fluctuations from these repeatedly scanned OCT images. This methodology is termed as OCTARA (OCT Angiography Ratio Analysis) algorithm where calculations are based on a ratio between the intensity values across points within one scan, and identical points in the repeated scans. OCTARA provides relative sensitivity advantage of the order of 10 \~ 50 times for medium to low blood flow. Automated segmentation was performed by OCT software to separate each layer of the retina. The en-face images of the superficial capillary network were derived from an en-face slab, ranged from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) to the inner border of the inner nuclear layer (INL).

The investigators developed a custom windows software with Microsoft Visual studio 2012 and C# language with a dot net library. This software calculates the sectoral average vessel density exactly matching to the GCIPL sectors. It requires two image files, superficial vascular layer image and color vessel density map, exported from OCTA instrument. Once after two image files were loaded, fovea is automatically detected but in case software fails, user can manually set foveal location. Then, it calculates mean sectoral vessel density between two ellipsoidal boundaries, outer boundary 4800 x 3000 µm and inner boundary 1200 x 1000 µm (width x height) centered on fovea. This diameter of inner and outer ellipse and angle of sectorization is exactly matched to the GCIPL sectorization. The mean vessel density was calculated from color density map. First, custom software scans all pixel colors within the sectoral boundary. Then, each pixel colors are converted to the vessel density values according to the manufacturer's guide. Finally, it takes average of all vessel density values. This mean vessel density is a unitless value ranged from 0 to 100.

\<Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging\> The Cirrus SD-OCT instrument (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Software version 6.0) will be used to measure macular GCIPLT. After pupil dilation using 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine, a single macular scan (200 × 200 macular cube scan protocol) of each eye was acquired. The GCA algorithm automatically segmented the GCIPL and RNFL and calculated the thickness of the macular GCIPL and RNFL within a 14.13 mm2 elliptical annulus area centered on the fovea.

NCT02318186,Pharmacokinetic Study of Sub-q and IV Treprostinil in Kids With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH),"Multi-center, Open-label Pharmacokinetic Study of Subcutaneously and Intravenously Administered Treprostinil in Children With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)","Abstract

This is a multi-center, open-label pharmacokinetic (PK) study examining the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose of treprostinil delivered intravenously or subcutaneously in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Subjects will be divided into 5 cohorts by age. A blood sample will be obtained from each subject at steady state. Additional blood samples will be obtained from a small subset of subjects with a 15% increase or with at least a 15ng/kg/min increase in dose from steady state. Samples will be sent to a pharmacokinetic laboratory for analysis. Linear regression analysis will be used to determine the relationship between the steady state plasma concentration and drug dose. A power model will be used to assess dose proportionality.","Background Information and Rationale

Treprostinil has not been adequately studied to determine its safety and efficacy in children ≤ 16 years old. However, the drug's use and tolerance in children with PAH has been demonstrated in studies with small sample sizes.

Although the pharmacokinetic relationship of treprostinil has been established in adult patients with PAH, the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose for children requires further investigation because of physiologic differences, such as the maturity of enzyme systems and drug clearance mechanisms, between children and adults. The subjects in this study will be divided into cohorts by age to address the physiologic changes that occur throughout childhood.

Currently, no data exists demonstrating the relationship between the steady-state plasma concentration and dose for children treated with intravenously or subcutaneously delivered treprostinil. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil among different age cohorts in children will provide the data to make an informed recommendation for dosing based on age (and possibly weight).",COMPLETED,,2013-10,2017-08-01,2017-08-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,51,ACTUAL

In this study, Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o. will be implanted during a combined surgery of cataract and non - penetrating deep sclerectomy in a group of 16 patients with primary open angle glaucoma and clinically significant cataract. Given that a considerable number of glaucoma patients also suffer from cataract, it is reasonable to test Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o. during a combined procedure of phacoemulsification and deep sclerectomy. This is also of importance because a combined procedure avoids the need of a second operation in this group of patients. Finally, it has been shown that combined phacoemulsification - deep sclerectomy does not induce a further risk compared to deep sclerectomy alone(open phase I study).

Safety will be assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events.

Its incidence is 22.5 new cases each year per 100,000 overweight women of childbearing age, and is rising \[Garrett, et al., 2004\] in parallel with the obesity epidemic. It affects about 100,000 Americans. Most patients suffer debilitating headaches. Because of pressure on the optic nerve (papilledema), 86% have some degree of permanent visual loss and 10% develop severe visual loss \[Wall, et al., 1991\]. Interventions to prevent loss of sight, all with unproven efficacy, include diet, diuretics such as acetazolamide, repeated spinal taps, optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures. The purported goal of these therapies is to lower intracranial pressure; however, it is unclear which treatments work and by what mechanism. None of these strategies has been verified by properly designed clinical trials. Thus, there is confusion, uncertainty, and weak scientific rationales to guide treatment decisions. This trial will study subjects who have mild visual loss from IIH to (1) establish convincing, evidence-based treatment strategies for IIH to restore and protect vision, (2) follow subjects up to 4 years to observe the long-term treatment outcomes and (3) determine the cause of IIH. To meet those aims, the trial will be divided into a 12-month intervention phase and a 3-year observational phase. Subjects are not required to complete the observational phase of the study, but will be asked to do so and consented for the observational phase of the study at the conclusion of the intervention phase (12 months).","Clinical Phase: Phase II Investigators: NORDIC Network sites Study Centers: 38 study centers Coordinating Center - University of Rochester Statistical Center - University of Rochester Study Period Planned enrollment duration: 2 years Planned duration of treatment: 6 months followed by open-label treatment Planned duration of follow-up: 4.5 years Study Objectives: The primary objective is determining the efficacy of diet plus acetazolamide vs diet alone in reducing or reversing visual loss in subjects with mild visual loss.

The secondary objective is to identify proteomic and genetic risk factors for IIH by screening a large cohort of IIH patients and controls.

Study Population This project will enroll 166 individuals with IIH who are 18-60 years of age. We anticipate that the population will be primarily composed of women in the childbearing years that are overweight. 154 control subjects will also be enrolled. Control subjects will be matched as closely as possibly by age, sex, race, ethnicity and weight to subjects enrolled at the site.

Study Design: Multi-center, double-blind randomized intervention study followed by a 4-year observation period. Subjects will be randomized to diet and acetazolamide or diet and placebo. The study will use 250 mg acetazolamide or matching placebo tablets taken with food at meals and at bedtime. The subject will begin with one tablet four times daily, at meals and at bedtime for the first week. Beginning on Day 7, subjects will increase the dosage by 1 tablet every 4 days until a final dosage of 4 tablets four times daily (4 grams) is reached or side effects prohibit increasing the dosage further. If the study drug is not tolerated at a dose of 250 mg, then 125 mg (1/2 tablet) will be tried. If this is not tolerated, no pharmacologic treatment will be given.

After the 6 month visit, all subjects will transition from study medication to acetazolamide (open label) by replacing one tablet of study drug with 250 mg of acetazolamide every four days. The acetazolamide dose will be titrated in a manner similar to the initial study drug schedule to the maximum tolerated dose of acetazolamide. To avoid treating subjects (who may have initially been assigned to placebo) unnecessarily, any subject with grade 0-1 papilledema will be tapered off study drug but not placed on acetazolamide unless they have persisting headaches or pulse-synchronous tinnitus. If so, they will be placed on acetazolamide regardless of the low papilledema grade. At the 9-month follow-up visit, we will make sure that the subjects' vision is stable after the transition off of study medication. After the 9 month visit, medication will be prescribed by the subject's treating physician. The intervention phase of the study will end at the subject's 12 month visit and subjects will be invited to participate in the observational phase of the study and consented to do so if willing.

Pulmonary hypertension Group 2 (PH 2) associated with left-sided heart disease is relatively common, is associated with a poor prognosis, and unfortunately there are no proven medical treatments beyond attempts at correcting the left sided heart disease. Many PH 2 patients have evidence of vasoconstriction and increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Use of agents or procedures which produce a reversible chemical sympathectomy have not been systematically tested in PH 2.

Methods. Two groups will be eligible for participation: Group 1 (n=10): Patients with PH 2 previously documented by echocardiography (echo), 6 minute walk test, biomarkers, and right heart catheterization (RHC) will receive reserpine, 0.05 mg per day for two weeks, then, 0.1 mg per day for an additional two weeks.

Non-traditional risk factors such as increased homocysteine concentrations are believed to be causally related to CVD. The interactive effect between hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia on the risk of CVD has received great attention. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)was the main regulatory enzymes for homocysteine metabolism. MTHFR converts 5,10-methylene-THF into 5-methyl-THF. Polymorphism of MTHFR C677T leads to a reduction in enzyme activity, which may lead to an increased concentration of plasma homocysteine and lower levels of serum folate, particularly in those with low folate intake. Enalapril Maleate-Folate Tablets, known to reduce both blood pressure and serum homocysteine and thereby preventing stroke, was found to have adverse events, such as cough, called ACEI-intolerance in some patients.

In the present study, we sought to assess:(1)the efficacy and safety of Amlodipine-Folic Acid Tablets in lowing blood pressure and homocysteine in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia (hcy≥10μmol/L)and ACEI intolerance;(2)whether the blood pressure and homocysteine-lowing efficacy of Amlodipine-Folic Acid Tablets can be modified by individual MTHFR C677T polymorphisms.

In all, about 540 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia and ACEI intolerance will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible subjects are randomly and double-blindly assigned to one of the three treatment groups:1)amlodipine tablet(5mg,control group);2)amlodipine-folic acid tablet(5mg amlodipine combined with 0.4mg of folic acid,low FA group);or 3)amlodipine-folic acid tablet (5mg amlodipine combined with 0.8mg of folic acid,high FA group),once daily for 8 weeks.

NCT06571539,Augmented Reality-Assisted Neurosurgical Drain Placement,High-accuracy Augmented Reality Guidance for Intracranial Drain Placement Using a Standalone Head-worn Navigation System,"The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if high-accuracy augmented reality (AR) guidance for external ventricular drain (EVD) placement using a standalone head-worn navigation system can improve current shortcomings of freehand and image-guidance techniques. It will assess safety, feasibility and clinical performance. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is the implementation of a standalone head-worn AR navigation system for EVD placement in critical care settings feasible and safe?
* How does it compare to the conventional freehand technique in terms of EVD placement quality, complication rate and revision rate?

Researchers will assess placement quality using the modified Kakarla scale, grading placement quality based on the position of the EVD tip on postoperative CT imaging. The amount of attempts, complications and revisions will be documented. The results of the AR-guided placements will be compared to a matched, non-concurrent freehand control group.

Participants will undergo AR-guided EVD placement in a critical care setting (i.e. the emergency room or intensive care unit).","External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is often performed using the freehand technique. In comparison to image-guided methods, this technique was identified as the primary risk factor of improper outcome, yielding optimal placement in only 70%. While conventional image guidance technologies introduce a distinct improvement in accuracy, these systems tend to be prohibitively large and lack mobility, restricting their use to the operating room. As such, their practical implementation in critical care settings is not always feasible due to time, availability, and cost constraints.

This study aims to address shortcomings in both conventional EVD placement and current image guidance technologies. To achieve this, first an AR headset-based navigation system was developed, providing high-accuracy inside-out infrared tracking and software features specifically focusing on EVD placement. Phantom studies were conducted, which proved successful, with a positive outcome of AR-guided EVD placement on phantom heads over the freehand technique. Given these results, the researchers aim to test the system in a clinical trial setting.

Given the additional layer of information on top of knowledge and experience regarding the freehand technique, it is hypothesized that AR guidance will result in an improved outcome, as was the case for conventional neuronavigation.

This study is a prospective clinical pilot study, with the goal to assess feasibility, safety and clinical performance of high-accuracy AR-guided EVD placement using a standalone head-worn navigation system in critical care settings at the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel over the course of one year. The outcome will be quantified using the modified Kakarla scale to assess EVD placement quality on postoperative CT imaging, as well as the amount of attempts, complications and revisions. The results of the AR-guided placements will be compared to a non-concurrent control group of matched (for quantity, intervention, performing surgeons and timeframe) freehand EVD placement cases that will be collected retrospectively.

One intervention is based on complexity science and the other is a traditional QI intervention.","Evidence-based guidelines for primary care of diabetes have been established and disseminated, yet adoption of guidelines in community-based primary care practice has been disappointing. This effectiveness study proposes a randomized trial involving 54 community-based primary care practices to test two innovative interventions to improve diabetes and depression care. One intervention, derived from theoretically based and efficacious programs tested in other settings, adopts a broad focus and seeks to improve diabetes and depression care by a) increasing the practice's organizational capacity to manage change, and b) implementing and sustaining chronic care office systems that support clinician efforts to improve care for diabetes. The intervention will combine two integrated components. The first component will utilize an Improvement Facilitator that will assess the practice's current use of chronic care office systems and their organizational capacity to manage change, provide feedback to key stakeholders in the practice, and work with the practice over six months to form an Improvement Team that will both address organizational capacity to create and sustain improvement and implement chronic care systems. In the second component of the intervention, the practice will participate in a local Improvement Collaborative that will afford opportunities to learn and share experiences during implementation and maintenance phases of the intervention with five similar practices in their geographic area. The second intervention is based on traditional QI methods and focuses on a chronic disease registry with regular reports to the physicians. It also uses PDSA cycles to assist in implementing change. This intervention will offer tools to improve diabetes and/or asthma care. Both interventions will be evaluated in two ways. First, a randomized trial using rigorous quantitative methods will measure 2 primary and 3 secondary endpoints at 9 and 18 months, including a) the ADA Physician Recognition Program performance measures by both patient-report and review of the medical record, and b) HEDIS measures of acute phase management of depression, c) assessment of the extent to which practices implement and physicians use elements of the chronic care model in their care of diabetes and depression. Change from baseline to 9 months will assess adoption of chronic care improvements, and change from 9 to 18 months will assess sustainability of improvements. Second, a multimethod assessment process will be used to analyze all qualitative and quantitative data separately to understand how and why the intervention led to the observed effects. The practice assessment will strive to understand which components of the interventions were most effective, their relative costs for implementation, and how they might be further improved.
