NCT06375694,Probiotic Effect on Dietary Nitrate to Plasma Nitrite Production ( OPEDNPN ),Oral Probiotic Effect on Dietary Nitrate to Plasma Nitrite Production,"Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important molecule that is produced naturally in the body and that helps maintain healthy blood flow. Low availability of NO contributes to many diseases while administration of NO is therapeutic.

In addition to being made naturally in the body, NO can be obtained through the diet via the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle. Nitrate, which is abundant in green leafy vegetables and beetroot juice, is partially converted to nitrite by oral bacteria. The nitrate and nitrite are taken up into the blood and nitrite is converted into NO. Remaining nitrate in the blood is taken back up into the mouth by salivary glands and the cycle continues. Emerging studies suggest that the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle may contribute to cardiovascular health. In addition, there have been many studies where dietary nitrate is given to increase NO and treat various conditions.

The current study rests on the premise that the quality of the oral microbiome plays a major role in the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle and hence cardiovascular health and the efficacy of dietary nitrate interventions. Investigators have begun to identify oral bacterial species that are effective nitrite producers as well as though that are nitrite depleters (those that interfere with nitrite production from nitrate).

In laboratory experiments, certain bacterial species have been shown to block nitrate to nitrite conversion by other oral bacteria. These nitrite depleting species are found in a commercially available oral probiotic designed to improve oral health. The purpose of this study is to examine if use of the probiotic negatively affects the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle. Nitrate to Nitrite conversion will be assessed by measuring plasma levels of nitrite before and after consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice. Dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite conversion will assessed at baseline and after one week of consumption of the probiotic or a placebo (follow-up). The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants that consume the probiotic will have lower nitrate to nitrite conversion at follow-up compared to baseline and that there will be no significant change in nitrate to nitrite conversion between baseline and follow-up for participants who consume the placebo.

While this study does not aim to treat any specific disease, it is intended to elucidate a basic physiological function that may be relevant to cardiovascular health and certain NO-based therapeutics.","Background

Nitric oxide (NO) plays critical roles in a myriad of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology and function of various organs and systems.1,2 Low NO bioavailability contributes to pathology in multiple diseases including hemolytic anemias,3 malaria,4,5 transfusion of older stored blood,6,7 chronic heart failure,8 atherosclerosis,9 and diabetes.10 Recent reports suggest that the oral microbiome is linked with regulating NO homeostasis through the action of certain bacteria that have an ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite.11-15 Nitrite is then further reduced to NO through a variety of mechanisms in different tissues.16,17 Plasma nitrate is taken up back into the oral cavity by salivary glands so that the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle provides sustained increases in NO bioavailability. Many clinical studies have used dietary nitrate as a source of NO through nitrite conversion.18-24 However, there is substantial variability in the clinical outcomes due to dietary nitrate intake and this is reflected in variability in the amount of nitrate converted to plasma nitrite.13,24-29 30. The variability and hence a large overall limitation in efficacy of dietary nitrate based treatments has been attributed to the capacity of the oral microbiome to reduce nitrate to nitrite.24-27 Preliminary work has begun to identify bacterial strains that are efficient nitrate to nitrite converters as well as those that actually inhibit nitrate to nitrite conversion.31,32 The efficiency of the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle and the role of oral bacteria may contribute to normal health.11 Thus, understanding the variability in nitrate to nitrite conversion and aspects of the oral microbiome could lead to improvements in normal cardiovascular health. In addition, in order to maximize benefits from dietary nitrate interventions, we need to understand factors of the oral microbiome that affect nitrate to nitrite conversion. The investigators have recently discovered that several species of Lactobacillus produce a metabolite that blunts nitrate to nitrite conversion by other oral bacteria in vitro. Several of these Lactobacillus species are the main component of a commercially available oral probiotic, https://www.amazon.com/Dental-Probiotics-Breath-Gingivitis-Throat/dp/B096SZSFFS

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to determine if Lactobacillus will blunt dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite conversion.

The investigators hypothesize that the presence of oral Lactobacillus will blunt the conversion of dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite and will test this by comparing the conversion before and after use of this probiotic.

The main hypothesis rests on the auxiliary hypothesis that use of the oral probiotic will results in increased abundance of Lactobacillus in the oral cavity and will test this through genomic sequencing.

Methods OPEDNPN All eligible volunteers will be consented after learning about the study and agreeing to participate. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) Probiotic and (2) Placebo. A total of 20 volunteers (10 per group) will participate in the study. The only difference for participants for each group will be whether they receive the placebo or probiotic.

All volunteers will participate in two visits: (1) Visit 1, baseline and (2) Visit 2, follow up. At each visit, volunteers will report to the Olin Physical Lab room 208 after having fasted for 3 hours prior. They can drink water one hour before the visit. Participants will be instructed not to use anti-bacterial mouthwash the day of the visit. The participant will be asked to provide 4 mL of saliva and a study team member will collect a bacterial sample from the posterior dorsal surface of their tongue (as described below). These samples will be frozen at -80 degrees for genetic analysis and identification of bacterial strains.

After saliva and tongue samples are collected, blood will be drawn (as described below) for plasma nitrite and nitrate determination. This blood sample will be the ""pre-"" sample collected at baseline and follow-up. Volunteers will then drink one 70 mL Beet it Sport Nitrate 400 shot (https://www.beet-it.us/pages/beet-it-sports). A ""post-"" blood draw will be collected 2.5 hours after consumption of the beetroot juice.

At Visit 1, after the second blood draw, volunteers will receive 7 days worth of either probiotic or the placebo. Volunteers will consume the probiotic (or placebo) as indicated by the manufacturer of the probiotic once a day. On day 8, the volunteers will return for visit 2.

The data will include (1) baseline and follow-up analysis of oral bacterial strains and (2) Pre- and post-beet juice consumption plasma nitrite and nitrate levels. The investigators hypothesize that the abundance of Lactobacillus will be higher at follow-up compared to baseline for volunteers taking the probiotic but that there will be no change in the placebo group. The investigators also hypothesize that the change in plasma nitrite (post minus pre) will be lower at follow-up than at baseline for volunteers taking the probiotic but that there will be no change in the placebo group.

* Study Materials (all commercially available):

  1. Placebo: Honest Placebo Pills by Zeebo
  2. Herbiotics Oral + Ent Probiotic
  3. Beet it Sport Nitrate 400 shot
* Collection of Saliva and Tongue scraping. Volunteers will report to the Olin Physical Lab room 208 after having fasted for 3 hours prior. They can drink water one hour before the visit. Participants will be instructed not to use anti-bacterial mouthwash the day of the visit. The participant will be asked to provide 4 mL of saliva by spitting into a microcentrifuge tube. For the tongue samples, a HydraFlock 6"" Sterile Large Flock Swab w/Polystyrene Handle (Puritan Medical) will be used to collect scrapings. Volunteers will be asked to open their mouths as wide as possible and stick out their tongue. The posterior 1/3 of the dorsal surface of the tongue will be sampled by scraping lightly to moderately firmly the dorsal surface of the tongue back and forth Scraping will take a minute or so. The tongue scraping will be placed in 0.85 mL of buffered sterile saline and 0.15 mL glycerol. All samples will be frozen at -80°C and sent to Professor Hariom Yadav at the University of South Florida for genomic analysis.
* Blood draws and processing Blood will be drawn by a certified, trained phlebotomist. Blood samples (maximum \~10 mL) will be collected from participants following consent. Blood will be collected at each visit pre and 2.5 hours post beet juice consumption. Blood will be drawn as close to the 2.5 hour mark as possible. Realistically, it may occur between 2 to 3 hours after the final study beverage is consumed. Blood will be drawn by lab personnel with certified phlebotomy training via standard venipuncture methods or Tasso HemolinkTM device. The HemoLinkTM is an FDA-approved blood collection device that uses small lancets and gentle suction to collect a very small sample (\~ ¼ teaspoons) of blood. Blood will be collected in standard blood collection tubes (e.g. citrate (blue-top), EDTA (purple-top) and heparin (green-top)) and labeled appropriately. The preferred tube is a 4 mL heparin tube. All blood samples drawn for research purposes will be identified by the study participant number and date/time of collection, which will also be recorded on the standardized data collection form. No personal identifying information will be included on the samples processed for research purposes. All blood samples will be immediately spun immediately in a centrifuge at 600-800g for five minutes and the supernatant collected. The plasma will be frozen on dry ice and then stored at -80°C for analysis of nitrite and nitrate content.
* Probiotic or placebo consumption Both the probiotic and placebo will be consumed twice a day according to instructions for the probiotic. One capsule is chewed or allowed to melt in the volunteer's mouth and then the contents are switched around in the mouth before being swallowed.

Risks Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn from patients willing to participate. This will be done in the usual fashion, preparing the venipuncture site with the local anesthetic EMLA, then drawing blood through a small gauge (23 or 21) butterfly needle. Drawing blood from a vein may be associated with discomfort or bruising at the site of needle puncture. Rarely, fainting or infection at the site of needle puncture may occur. All blood will be drawn from a person trained in phlebotomy. There will be no way to trace the blood back to the donor.

There are no known health risks for donating saliva or tongue scrapings from individuals who will be included in the study. There is a very minimal risk of linking individuals to the study. There will be no way to trace the saliva or tongue scrapings back to the donor.

Protections Against Risk Strategies for protection against risk. To protect privacy of participants and confidentiality of research data, no personal information regarding individual participants will be linked to the in vitro studies.

Plans for medical attention. In case of injury (which is extremely unlikely) as a result of saliva donation, the individuals will be instructed to contact their physician and medical care will be offered and charged to available research coverage maintained at Wake Forest School of Medicine.

In case of injury as a result of blood drawing, the patients will be instructed to contact their physician and medical care will be offered and charged to available research coverage maintained at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Blood drawn on the Reynolda campus is not a clinical setting, but blood will be drawn by trained phlebotomists with years of experience who maintain their training.

Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes will be promptly reported by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency if appropriate.

Incidental Findings. No incidental findings are expected to be discovered in this study as measures of bacterial nitrate reduction are not currently of clinical relevance so a strange, individual result in that measure would not be worth communicating.

Sample size assessment and statistical analysis

The investigators plan to enroll 10 participants who receive the probiotic and 10 participants who receive the placebo. The investigators hypothesize that, using a paired t-test, participants taking the probiotic will have significantly (P \< .05) lower change in plasma nitrite (post minus pre) at follow up compared to baseline while there will be no significant effect of the placebo (paired t-test).

The Investigators calculated that they would have 80% power to measure a 75% decrease in the change in nitrite at follow-up compared to baseline for the probiotic group with 10 participants per group (Continuous endpoint Two independent samples). The investigators assumed a 60% standard deviation in the change in nitrite for follow-up vs baseline based on previous data from our lab.",RECRUITING,,2024-06-01,2025-05,2025-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,20,ESTIMATED

NCT01292694,Contribution of Angiotensin II to Supine Hypertension in Autonomic Failure,Contribution of Angiotensin II to Supine Hypertension in Autonomic Failure,"The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that angiotensin II plays a role in the supine hypertension of primary autonomic failure. To determine the contribution of angiotensin II to renin and blood pressure regulation in autonomic failure, patients with multiple system atrophy \[MSA\] or pure autonomic failure \[PAF\] and supine hypertension will undergo medication testing with the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan. The investigators will compare the biochemical and hemodynamic effects between MSA and PAF patients. In a subset of patients, the investigators will also give the ACE inhibitor captopril. Our primary endpoint will be changes in plasma renin activity, and subsequent components of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, in response to angiotensin II blockade. Our secondary outcome will be changes in hemodynamic measures during administration of these drugs.","Primary autonomic failure is a disabling condition characterized by orthostatic hypotension. It is less well appreciated that at least 50% of these patients have high blood pressure when lying down \[supine hypertension\]. The mechanisms underlying supine hypertension in autonomic failure remain poorly understood. The hypertension in MSA patients may be explained by residual sympathetic tone, possibly acting on hypersensitive adrenoreceptors and unrestrained by the lack of baroreflex modulation. In contrast, the hypertension in PAF is associated with increased vascular resistance in the absence of residual sympathetic tone. However, the factors driving an elevation in either sympathetic or vascular tone in these patients remain unclear.

The investigators hypothesize that angiotensin II, a hormone widely implicated in blood pressure regulation, plays a role in the supine hypertension of autonomic failure. To determine the contribution of angiotensin II to renin and blood pressure regulation in autonomic failure, the investigators will administer the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan to MSA and PAF patients with supine hypertension. The primary endpoint will be changes in plasma renin activity, and subsequent components of the circulating renin-angiotensin system, in response to angiotensin II blockade. The secondary outcomes will be the decrease in blood pressure and changes in heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance during administration of these drugs.

This study will also assess the effect that changing to Remodulin will have on patient satisfaction with their treatment and impact on quality of life.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a variety of diseases and syndromes. Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately leading to inactivity and death. The goal of PAH treatment is to lengthen survival time, to ameliorate symptoms of PAH and to improve health related quality of life (HRQOL).

Remodulin® (treprostinil sodium), a stable analogue of prostacyclin, possesses potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilatory and platelet anti-aggregatory actions in vitro and in vivo. Recently, Remodulin received FDA approval for intravenous therapy based upon bioequivalence of the IV and SC routes of administration. Remodulin is more chemically stable than epoprostenol and may offer potential safety and convenience advantages compared to intravenous epoprostenol that may impact Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and/or patient satisfaction. Unlike epoprostenol, Remodulin does not need to be mixed daily and is stable at room temperature eliminating the need for ice packs. Furthermore, since Remodulin remains in the body longer than epoprostenol (4 hrs instead of less than 5 minutes) there is less risk of cardiovascular collapse from a sudden interruption of infusion, such as a line clog. In an open-label study in Europe, patients who were using a type of portable medication pump called the CADD Legacy pump were rapidly switched from Flolan to Remodulin with no serious side effects. This study will examine effects of switching from therapy with epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin and compare changes in HRQOL and treatment satisfaction before and after rapid switch from epoprostenol to Remodulin in patients with pulmonary hypertension using the CADD legacy pump.

NCT04670094,Comorbidities and Risk Score in COVID-19 Patients,Comorbidities and Risk Score for Severity and Outcome in Patients With Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,Retrospective multi-center cohort study. Consecutive patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) up to October 2020 will be included. Patients are followed until discharge from hospital or death.,"Background

A virus causing clusters of severe pneumonia was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

This pathogen was designated as SARS-CoV-2. Although of probable zoonotic origin, human-to-human transmission has rapidly fuelled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally.

On February 20th, the first case of locally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in Northern Italy in a critically ill, hospitalized young man with no travel history to known areas of viral circulation or link to a probable or confirmed coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) case. Prior to this date, only three cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Central Italy, all with a travel history to Wuhan. Following this unexpected finding, case counts, and death tolls has increased rapidly in the country with a total of 192,994 confirmed cases and 25,969 deaths as of 24 April 2020.

Study rationale

Multiple variables have been described as possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, severity and prognosis, among which age, sex and comorbidities play an important role.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed the underlying medical conditions that have shown to increase the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2. While some comorbidities, such as serious heart conditions and chronic kidney disease have a consistent and strong evidence as bad prognostic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection, others as HIV have a limited evidence and heterogeneous results.

Further, despite it is well-known that the burden of co-existing diseases may be additive or even multiplicative, the effect of specific disease cluster on COVID-19 adverse outcomes has never been evaluated. Finally, the proposed models and risk scores currently available to predict disease severity and mortality are poorly reported and at high risk of bias, raising concern that their predictions could be unreliable when applied in daily practice. A reliable risk/prognostic score developed by a multidimensional and cross-validated approach will pave the way for future research on frail sectors of the population and on the use of health system resources. At the clinical level, a prognostic score will allow to predict severity and mortality risk in patients requiring hospitalization and to stratify patients according to clinical severity helping clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will confirm risk predictors already known and provide evidence for the uncertain ones. The investigators will also develop a prognostic score able to predict negative clinical outcomes (primarily short-term mortality), that will be useful to stratify patients at hospital admission according to their different risk profiles, and therefore to ""tailor"" the individuals' level of care.

A secondary objective could be that to extend this approach at the susceptible population level, especially the elders, to stratify according to the higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized and to have a dismal outcome (not developed here but related to a possible amendment).

Sample size

The investigators expect the total number of patients with complete data to be approximately 2500, based on the expected recruitment of each center.

Analysis Plan

Data will be summarized by counts and percentage and quartiles for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multi-state models will be used to describe patient's hospital mortality and discharge. In-hospital mortality will be estimate accounting for discharge as competing event. Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate mortality up to 3-months from admission. The role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome will be evaluated by the Cox model adjusting for relevant confounders. A clinically-based prognostic score will be developed including comorbidities and other risk factors. The score will be constructed by a multidimensional approach and Lasso approach will be used to select relevant risk factors. The Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) and Brier score will be used to evaluate model performance and the final score will be cross-validated. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a training and test validation approach. The use of regression trees for a practical definition of risk subgroups and latent variable models will also be considered.

Multiple imputation will be performed if missing would exceed 10%.

Data collection

Consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 up to October 2020 will be included. Given the difficulty in systematically obtaining written informed consent and given the great public interest of the project, the research will be conducted in the context of the authorizations guaranteed by Article 89 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU Regulation 2016/679, which guarantees processing for purposes of public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes of health data.",COMPLETED,,2020-12-30,2021-05-29,2021-05-29,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,4555,ACTUAL

The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of the implementation of a postpartum CVD prevention lifestyle program in women with a HDP as well as the transferability and fidelity of the Ottawa-based CardioPrevent® program to a centre in Calgary (following a ""Train the Trainer"" model). Secondary objectives include an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of this intervention on clinical outcomes and measures of microvascular function between study arms at one year.","1. Background and Rationale

   Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (i.e., coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Canada, particularly amongst women. Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) represent one of the highest-risk populations for premature CVD and CVD mortality. The 2011 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines on the prevention of CVD in women now include HDP as an independent CVD risk factor in the evaluation of CVD risk. To achieve ""ideal cardiovascular health"" targets, healthy lifestyle modifications are suggested as first-line therapy, with pharmacotherapy as second line. The immediate postpartum period may be an early window of opportunity for early upstream CVD prevention, capitalizing on a woman's increased motivation to improve her health. Despite these recommendations and opportunity for early CVD prevention, there is little published data, and, in particular, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the short-term or long-term effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in women with HDP.

   To address this important clinical problem and knowledge gap, the interdisciplinary IMPROVE team adapted the evidence-based University of Ottawa Heart Institute CardioPrevent® Lifestyle program to proactively address the unique barriers to, and facilitators of behaviour change in early postpartum women with HDP. Prior to undertaking a widespread evaluation of CardioPrevent® in a CVD prevention study for women with HDP, a pre-assessment of the feasibility of this postpartum lifestyle program using this research approach through a pilot study is essential. In addition, this pilot study will provide important information on CardioPrevent®'s effectiveness on modifying clinically-important cardiovascular-related clinical outcomes and novel, non-invasive measures of microvascular function in early postpartum women with HDP to inform the design of a larger CVD prevention study. This pilot RCT will be the first to assess the feasibility and effects of a one-year postpartum-specific CVD prevention lifestyle program in women with a HDP.
2. Research Questions \& Objectives

   The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of the implementation of a postpartum CVD prevention lifestyle program in women with a HDP as well as the transferability and fidelity of the Ottawa-based CardioPrevent® program to a centre in Calgary (following a ""Train the Trainer"" model). Secondary objectives include: an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of this intervention on clinical outcomes and measures of microvascular function between study arms at one year.
3. Methods

Study Design: A 2-year, single centre, single-blind, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Study Population (Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria): Women with a HDP (i.e., preeclampsia, eclampsia or gestational hypertension) delivering at the Foothills Medical Centre will be invited to participate. Women with pre-existing chronic hypertension, diabetes (type 1 or type 2), kidney disease or cardiovascular disease (coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial) will be excluded.

Intervention: CardioPrevent® Program - a one year, evidence-based cardiovascular prevention program that consists of 25 contacts (either in person or by phone) with a trained behaviour change counsellor to facilitate desired lifestyle behaviours within the participants' own social context.

Control: Standard clinical postpartum care. All Participants: Participants in both arms will receive educational material about the risk of CVD and CVD prevention for women with HDP from the Preeclampsia Foundation.

Sample size: A total of 84 women will be recruited (42 in each arm). Recruitment \& Retention: There are over 7000 deliveries per year at the FMC. Using a conservative estimate of 7% prevalence of HDP (as it is a tertiary care referral centre), approximately 245 women (10 per week) will have HDP over our 6-month recruitment period. The investigators anticipate recruiting 2-3 eligible women per week to reach the target sample size in 6 months. To minimize loss to follow-up, they plan to use participant incentives such as covering the costs of parking and childcare.",UNKNOWN,,2019-09,2019-11,2019-11,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,OTHER,84,ESTIMATED

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of frequent home (HBPM)- and 24 hour (ABPM) blood pressure measurements to achieve BP control in patients with essential hypertension according to Danish Society of Hypertension Gudelines. The study will include 120 general practioners (GP) randomised to perform either usual BP control or intensive BP control. Before randomization, participating GPs will recruit each 10 patients to be followed over a period of 12 months. At baseline ABPM will be measured in all eligible patients. The result of the baseline ABPM will be blinded in the usual care group. Following this, usual care (control) physicians will perform BP control according to their usual standard. Physicians randomized to intensive care will control BP by the use of frequent HBPM and ABPM. According to a pre-specified scheme patients followed by intensive care physicians will measure HBP in the morning and in the evening at three consecutive days after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 months in the study. Patients will communicate the results of these measurements to the treating physician, who according to the result of the HBPM will decide what action to take. As a further aid, at 6 month patients in the intensive care group will have another APBM as part of the follow up to ensure 24 hour BP control. In both the usual- and intensive care group all treatment decisions is entirely up to the treating physician. No pre-specified treatment algorithm has to be followed and both non-pharmacological as well as any pharmacological tretment can be used to (optimize) BP control. Patients followed by intensive care will receive extended structured information about the importance of optimal BP control. As the primary endpoint is change in mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure patients in both groups will have a ABPM after 12 months. During the whole trial, participating physicians will keep a record of all measured BP (clinic BP, HBP and ABP), as well as all relevant blood- and urinary tests (lipids, glucose, albuminuria) taken during the study. Based on all available information, patients total risk score (Danish Society of Hypertension) will be calculated at baseline and after 12 months.

Study Hypothesis:

Blood pressure control according to the Danish Society of Hypertension Guidelines is better obtained by an intensive care regimen (frequent home- and ambulatory blood pressure measurement) compared to a usual care regimen (standard blood pressure control in Danish general practice).

Comparison(s):

Frequent home- and ambulatory blood pressure measurements versus standard care.",COMPLETED,,2005-11,2007-06,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,1000,

NCT00099476,Effects of Dark Chocolate on Insulin Sensitivity in People With High Blood Pressure,Effects of Cocoa Consumption on Insulin Sensitivity and Capillary Recruitment in Subjects With Essential Hypertension,"This study will examine whether dark chocolate affects the way patients with hypertension (high blood pressure) respond to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates blood glucose (sugar) levels. In many people with hypertension, insulin is not as effective in helping the body use glucose. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin also increases blood flow into muscle by opening inactive blood vessels. Laboratory studies suggest that eating dark chocolate may improve blood pressure. This study will determine whether dark chocolate improves insulin resistance or changes how blood vessels react to insulin in hypertensive people.

People between 21 and 65 years of age who have high blood pressure and are not pregnant may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.

Participants refrain from eating foods containing chocolate or cocoa for 1 week and then come to the clinic on three separate occasions 3 weeks apart for a glucose clamp test and contrast ultrasound, described below. At the first glucose clamp test, subjects are randomly assigned to drink either a cocoa drink with high anti-oxidant content or one with a very low content of anti-oxidant. Each drink will be taken twice a day for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks, they return for a second glucose clamp test. At the second test, they stop taking the cocoa drink for 1 week and then start again for another 2 weeks. For this 2-week period, those who were given the high anti-oxidant content cocoa drink the first 2 weeks will take the placebo, very low anti-oxidant drink this time, and those who took the placebo will now have the high anti-oxidant cocoa drink. After this 2 weeks of taking the cocoa drink or placebo, they then take the third and last glucose clamp test.

Glucose clamp test: This test measures how the body responds to insulin. Subjects fast the night before each test and do not eat until the test is over, usually in the early afternoon. For the test, the subject lies in a bed or reclines in a chair. A needle is placed in a vein in each arm - one for collecting blood samples and the other for infusing glucose, insulin, and a potassium solution. Blood glucose and insulin levels are measured frequently during the test and the rate of the glucose infusion is adjusted to keep blood glucose at the baseline (fasting) level. Blood samples are tested for blood count, electrolytes, liver function...","Dark chocolate and other cocoa products contain antioxidants including the polyphenol epicatechin that have beneficial effects on vascular function. Oral consumption of dark chocolate lowers blood pressure in elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension while drinking cocoa acutely improves flow-mediated vasodilation in subjects with cardiovascular risk factors. Work from our lab and elsewhere has shown that regulation of hemodynamic and metabolic homeostasis are coupled such that subjects with essential hypertension are also insulin resistant. Therefore, we hypothesize that cocoa consumption will improve both blood pressure and insulin sensitivity in subjects with essential hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized double-blind, crossover study in subjects with essential hypertension to evaluate the effects of cocoa versus placebo on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and insulin-mediated capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle. After a 7 day cocoa-free run-in period, subjects will be randomized to receive 15 consecutive daily doses of either cocoa drink (150 ml twice a day with a total of 900 mg of polyphenols and 237 kcal) or polyphenol poor placebo drink (150 ml twice a day with a total of 36 mg of polyphenols and 234 kcal). After the 15 day treatment period, the subjects will enter a 1 week cocoa-free washout period followed by cross-over to the other treatment. Subjects will be counseled to maintain an isocaloric diet during the study. Blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and insulin-mediated capillary recruitment will be assessed in each subject after the run-in period, after 15 days of treatment, and after completion of the cross-over. Blood pressure will also be measured every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the duration of the study. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique. Insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment in forearm skeletal muscle will be measured by ultrasound with ""microbubble"" contrast during the glucose clamp studies. Peak and trough plasma epicatechin levels will be measured prior to each glucose clamp study using an HPLC assay. This study will determine if short-term oral administration of cocoa is effective at lowering blood pressure, improving insulin sensitivity, and restoring vascular function in subjects with essential hypertension.

In order to detect early development of cardiovascular disease, early detection of the endothelium of obese adolescents is needed. Endothelium dysfunction is an early stage of developing atherosclerosis, which can be a predictor of cardiovascular disease development in the future. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) is a non-invasive method that can measure endothelium function and predict the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is not only able to measure artery diameter, but also provides function index of nitric oxide (NO) in the endothelium. FMD is negatively related to BMI. Meanwhile, Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, because when its levels increase, ET-1 can cause a condition of hyperinsulinemia. ET-1 was found to be high in patients with cardiovascular disorders, as well as in obese and diabetic subjects. Alternative methods for assessing endothelial function by measurement of biomarkers of activation and endothelial dysfunction such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1). Levels of sICAM-1 have been found to be related positively to age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and inversely to estrogen. Furthermore, associations have been found between sICAM-1 and cardiovascular mortality in both healthy individuals and populations at high risk.

The aim of the study was to evaluate FMD, concentrations of ET-1 and sICAM-1 in adolescents with a presence of obesity and hypertension and to compare these with controls (obesity and non hypertension), as well as to analyze the correlations between FMD, ET-1, sICAM-1 and blood pressure values.","This study is cross sectional study with observational analytic that evaluates FMD, ET-1 dan sICAM-1 in obese adolescents with hypertension compared to obese adolescents without hypertension and normal adolescents.

This is a non interventional study.","Preeclampsia (PE) is a condition which affects approximately 2% of all pregnancies and can be a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity/mortality (2). The suspected underlying mechanism of PE is thought to be impaired trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries leading to impaired placental perfusion, placental ischemia and subsequent development of endothelial dysfunction (3). There is evidence that PE, which is commonly associated with fetal growth restriction, can be predicted effectively at 11-13 weeks gestational age by combined screening algorithms combining uterine artery pulsatility index (PI), maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and maternal serum concentrations of placental products including but not limited to plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and placental growth factor (PLGF) (4-6).

Specifically,the investigators are interested in patients diagnosed with high blood pressure during their pregnancy, as compared with normal pregnant patients. A noninvasive, accurate method of taking these measurements in pregnant patients is not currently available.","During pregnancy, many aspects of blood circulation, such as blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and stroke volume, adapt to accommodate the increasing needs of a pregnant body. The circulatory system works harder to provide blood flow to the placenta and the growing fetus.

Currently, the devices that can give physicians detailed information on the status of the blood circulation of normal patients and those with high blood pressure during pregnancy are invasive to varying degrees. However, recently, a new noninvasive hemodynamic monitor (NonInvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring: NICOM) was introduced to the market. In studies with non-pregnant patients, the NICOM has been found to be accurate, precise and reliable. However, it has yet to be studied in the field of Obstetrics.

The purpose of this study is to find out if the NICOM is an effective tool for monitoring hemodynamic changes in pregnant women, both with normal and high blood pressure. We are planning to compare the hemodynamic profiles of normal pregnant patients, hypertensive pregnant patients, and non pregnant patients as a control group. If this monitor proves to be reliable in assessing these changes in the pregnant patients, this could have a great impact in optimizing the care of the patients with different medical conditions in pregnancy, such as increased blood pressure.",COMPLETED,,2009-07,2009-12,2009-12,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,30,ACTUAL

It is designed to determine whether using natriuretic peptide measurement as a screening tool following a general cardiovascular risk factor screen will reduce the prevalence and severity of ventricular dysfunction in conjunction with specialist follow-up at St. Vincent's University Hospital.","A large proportion of the population has substantial left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and do not have symptoms (Stage B heart failure). For many of these patients, if identified and treated appropriately, it is possible to prevent the subsequent development of heart failure (HF). Although the current gold standard for detection of LVD is echocardiography, it is expensive and impractical for mass screening.

Natriuretic peptides are attractive candidates for screening populations for asymptomatic LVD particularly because of high negative predictive values. Furthermore, some studies have shown that, in the right setting, screening with natriuretic peptides might prove cost effective in combination with echocardiography for patients with elevated levels.

However, in common with many accepted screening strategies, there are no randomised studies which show that screening the population with natriuretic peptides for asymptomatic LVF alters the natural history of the condition.

From a large, community based cardiovascular risk screening programme including more than 13,000 patients, patients in the catchment area of St Vincent's University Hospital are invited to participate in the STOP-HF study. The objective of this work is to determine whether or not using natriuretic peptide screening in conjunction with specialist follow-up will reduce the prevalence and severity of LVD in a well-defined, at-risk, primary care population. It also aims to: evaluate the natural history of natriuretic peptides over time in this population; to clarify optimal screening cut-offs for the detection of LVD; to evaluate the clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, genetic and proteomic determinants of natriuretic peptides in this setting; to determine whether the clinical benefits of the STOP HF screening programme, if any, are cost effective.

The study design is prospective, randomised and parallel group.

The primary endpoint is the prevalence and severity LVD after 5 years of follow up. Secondary endpoints include: the natural history of natriuretic peptides; the relationship between natriuretic peptides and severity of LVD, death, hospital admissions; clinical, demographic, biochemical, pharmacological, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic determinants of natriuretic peptides; screening cost-effectiveness.

Participants who fulfill entry criteria at baseline will sign an informed consent and will be randomised onto the Usual Care or Intervention Care arm of the study. Usual care is defined as continued management of the patient by the primary care services using standard risk factor monitoring and intervention strategies. Intervention Care is defined as a collaborative cardiovascular management between primary care and specialist hospital based services. All participants will receive an intensive education session from a cardiovascular nurse on their risk factors and advice on healthy dietary and lifestyle habits.

There will be 2 years of enrollment with annual review and 5 years of follow-up to the primary endpoint. Permission has been received to extend the follow up period to 10 years. Regardless of randomisation, all patients receive full clinical and laboratory assessment at baseline and on completion of the STOP HF study (year 5). Additionally, all participants will receive echocardiography assessment during and at the conclusion of the study.

Data collection:

Data will be collected on all participants regarding their medical history and current medications. The source of data collection will be from medical records kept at the primary care practices and from patient interview. All participants will receive a booklet in which they will be asked to record any visits to their primary care practitioner, alterations in medications, new diagnoses and hospital admissions. Local hospital discharge records will be screened to detect any events throughout the course of the study.

Clinical Assessment:

At annual intervals, the cardiovascular research nurse will conduct clinical assessments on all participants including weight, abdominal girth measurement, blood pressure (triplicate measurements while lying in supine position), heart rate and observe for evidence of limb oedema. The nurse will also question the participants to investigate for symptoms of dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, orthopnoea, palpitations and fatigue.

Blood sampling and handling:

Peripheral venous blood samples will be drawn on all participants at annual intervals. Samples to assess natriuretic peptides will be drawn into vacutainers containing EDTA and samples to assess renal function, collagen turnover and lipid profile will be collected in vacutainers containing lithium heparin. BNP and Lipid profile assessment will be analysed using point of care meters, Biosite (Triage, USA) and Cholestech respectively. Each of the remaining samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes and the serum will be then aliquoted and stored at -80°C before analysis of biochemical, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic markers.

Echocardiographic Doppler analysis:

Two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, targeted M-mode and Doppler ultrasound measurements will be obtained in each patient. M-mode measurements are taken according to the guidelines laid down by the American Society of Echocardiography. All echocardiographic data will represent the mean of 3 measurements on different cardiac cycles.

NCT01296594,Improving Antihypertensive Medication Adherence,Improving Antihypertensive Medication Adherence,"Poor adherence to antihypertensive medications is associated with morbidity, and data suggest that substance abuse may contribute to poor adherence. Contingency management (CM), an intervention highly efficacious for improving outcomes of substance abusers, shows promise in improving medication adherence in a handful of small trials. CM involves providing tangible reinforcement each time the behavior (medication ingestion) is exhibited. Thus far, studies evaluating CM for increasing medication adherence have utilized MEMS caps, but reinforcement of adherence via MEMS caps is done relatively infrequently and with delay, hindering its efficacy. A widely utilized technology that may be more appropriate for reinforcing medication adherence is cell phones, which can record the process of pill ingestion through video functions. As regular monitoring and feedback is important in the efficacy of CM, patients can be provided with daily messages regarding adherence and CM earnings. In this pilot study, we propose to randomize 40 hypertensive substance abusing patients with suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medications to one of two 12-week treatment conditions: (1) usual care, or (2) usual care with cell phone monitoring and CM. In the CM condition, patients will carry a cell phone and record and send in time- and date-stamped self videos of medication ingestion. These patients will receive congratulatory messages or reminders about adherence, and they will earn vouchers each time medication ingestion occurs at the appropriate time, along with bonuses for sustained adherence. We hypothesize that the CM condition will improve self report and pill count measurements of medication adherence and that it will result in decreased blood pressure. Results from this study may have widespread implications for the use of cell phones as a novel technology to improve medication adherence.",,COMPLETED,,2011-02,2012-07,2012-07,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,30,ACTUAL

National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred caloric replacement strategy for SSBs. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and blood pressure in randomized trials. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk. Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.","Rationale:

Soy is at a nutritional ""cross-roads"". On one hand, it aligns with current dietary advice to consume plant-based dietary patterns \[1-6\] and has proven advantages \[7-9\]. On the other hand, it is under threat to have its health claim for CHD risk reduction revoked \[10\] and is often overshadowed by dairy in public health interventions for metabolic health. Strategies to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) have become one of the leading public health targets to address the epidemics of obesity and diabetes \[10-22\]. National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred replacement strategy for SSBs \[23-27\]. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies \[28,29\] and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and BP in randomized trials \[30\]. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives, which have shown distinct advantages over cow's milk for intermediate metabolic outcomes \[7,31-33\], is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the metabolic benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk.

Objective:

Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.

Design:

The trial will be a 6-month, 2-phase, 3-arm, non-inferiority, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of replacing SSBs with 2% soy milk versus 2% cow's milk on the primary outcome liver fat and secondary outcomes muscle fat, insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, glucose tolerance and established cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who are consuming ≥3 SSBs/day. The trial will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and reported according to CONSORT and the COSORT extension for non-inferiority trials \[34\]. The 3-arm design has the advantage of combing a superiority trial with a non-inferiority trial, by allowing us to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and reference (2% cow's milk) treatments over the control (SSBs) and the noninferiority of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment simultaneously. We chose a treatment duration of 24-weeks as this was the duration over which milk was shown to reduce liver fat in replacement for SSBs \[30\] and is a duration that will have a meaningful impact on public health policy \[35,36\].

Participants:

We will include186 overweight or obese (BMI, 27-40 kg/m2) adult (age, 18-75 years) men and nonpregnant women with MetS based on modified IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAAS/IASO \[37\] criteria (high waist circumference \[≥88cm females, ≥102cm males\] plus ≥2 of 4 dysglycemia \[FPG ≥5.6mmol/L\], high triglycerides \[≥1.7mmol/L\], low HDL-C \[\<1.0mmol/L males and \<1.3 mmol/L females\], or high blood pressure \[≥130/85mmHg\]) who are consuming ≥3 SSBs/day. We have modified the MetS definition to require a high WC to ensure the sample is enriched with participants with NAFLD (defined as hepatic steatosis/intrahepatocellular lipid \[IHCL\] by 1H-MRS ≥5.0%) \[38\]. We anticipate \> 50% of the sample will have NAFLD based on our entry criteria \[38,39\]. We will exclude individuals with diabetes or major illness.

Randomization:

The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) will perform block randomization with allocation concealment through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) program. Following successful completion of the run-in phase, participants will be randomized into 3 groups from each strata, using random permuted blocks with unequal sizes.

Protocol:

The trial will be conducted at the CFI-funded Toronto 3D Clinical Research Centre and MRI Research Unit and at the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Centre at St. Michael's Hospital. Eligible participants will undergo a 4-week run-in phase prior to randomization. Participants who wish to continue will then undergo a 24-week intervention phase in which they are randomized (see above) to 1 of 3 interventions: ≥3 servings of (1) 2% soy milk (test treatment), (2) 2% cow's milk (reference treatment/positive control) or (3) their usual SSBs (negative control). All study beverages will be provided with the instruction to replace usual SSBs intake while maintaining background diets. Participants will attend clinic visits every 4-weeks for review of beverage logs, collection of study foods, and clinical assessments of weight, waist circumference \[40\], and blood pressure. 1H-MRS measurements and 75g oral glucose tolerance tests (75g-OGTT; World Health Organization protocol \[41\]) with blood samples at -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes will be performed at 0 and 24 weeks as will collection of the Harvard Willett FFQ), and blood and fecal samples. Adherence biomarker samples will be collected at 0, 12, and 24 weeks.

Interventions:

The 3 interventions will consist of ≥3 servings of (1) 2% soy milk (Alpro Soya, 250mL single-serve shelf-stable packs, 100Kcal with 8g soy protein per 250mL), (2) 2% cow's milk (Organic Meadows®, 250mL, single-serve shelf-stable packs, 130Kcal with 8g casein/whey protein per 250mL), or (3) usual SSBs (355mL single-serve cans, 130-140kcal per 355mL). The participant's usual level of intake of SSBs will determine the dose (number of servings), providing a range of doses (that is, ≥ 3-servings or 24g protein for the soy and cow's milk) for dose response analyses. Although the soy and milk interventions will be matched for protein and serving size, we intentionally did not make the 3 interventions isocaloric, as the goal was to use ""real-world"" product substitutions.

Outcomes:

All outcome assessments will be blinded and assessed as the end value at week 24. The primary outcome will be liver fat (intrahepatocellular lipid \[IHCL\]) by 1H-MRS). Secondary outcomes will include change from baseline at week 24 of 75g-OGTT derived changes in insulin sensitivity (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index \[ISI\] \[42\]), beta-cell function (insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 \[ISSI-2\]) \[43,44\], and glucose tolerance (2hPG, iAUC). Exploratory outcomes will include ectopic muscle fat (intramyocellular lipid \[IMCL\]), continuous MetS criteria (waist circumference \[WC\], FPG, triglycerides \[TG\], HDL-C, and blood pressure \[BP\]), reversion of MetS (defined as a reversion to \<3 of 5 IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAAS/IASO criteria \[37\]; diabetes incidence (Diabetes Canada 2018 FPG, 2h-PG (75g-OGTT), or HbA1c criteria), and body weight, gut microbiome diversity (16S rRNA sequencing), markers of NAFLD (liver enzymes \[ALT, AST, GGT, ALP\], fatty liver index (FLI) \[45\]), hepatic insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), inflammation (hs-CRP), uric acid, established lipid targets (LDL-C, non-HDL-C), and diet quality (Alternative Healthy Eating Index \[AHEI\] using the Harvard Willett FFQ \[46\]). Adherence outcomes will include study beverage logs and objective biomarkers of intake of soy milk (urinary isoflavonoid excretion \[UIE\]\[47\]), cow's milk (dairy-derived serum fatty acids \[15:0, 17:0, CLA, trans-palmitoleic acid\]\[48\]), and SSBs (isotopic ratios of 13C/12C in serum fatty acids \[49\]).Other post hoc exploratory outcomes will be decided based on the availability of funding.

Data Management:

The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC), St. Michael's Hospital, will manage the digital database (REDCap) securely and ensure data integrity. This independent third party data management will be an important strength, bringing a high degree of credibility to the research.

Power:

A total of 186 participants will be randomized. N=62 per group will allow us to test the non-inferiority of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment with a non-inferiority margin (δ) of 75% of the effect of the reference treatment on the primary outcome ntra-hepatocellular lipid (IHCL) by 1H-MRS (1.5% absolute difference in IHCL based on a 75% preserved fraction of an expected 2% absolute difference in IHCL) by difference of means \[57\], assuming an SD of 3%, α=0.05, 80% power (β=0.20), and 20% attrition. A 2% absolute difference in IHCL was chosen as it is the minimum mean difference associated with clinically meaningful changes in downstream glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and/or blood lipids \[51-56\]. A non-inferiority margin (δ) of 75% was selected based on guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency \[58-60\]. This sample size will provide us ample power to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and the reference (2% cow's milk) treatments compared with the control (SSBs) treatment assuming the same 2% absolute difference in IHCL, SD of 3%, α=0.05, 80% power (β=0.20), and 20% attrition. It will also provide us with sufficient power for superiority testing of the secondary outcomes.

Statistical analysis:

All statistical analyses will be conducted using STATA 14 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) or a suitable statistical software package on end values at week-24 . The 3-arm design of the trial is intended to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and reference (2% cow's milk) treatments compared with the control treatment (SSBs) and the noninferiority of the active treatment (2% soy milk) compared with the reference treatment (2% cow's milk).

The testing of the primary outcome will be done in a stepwise manner to decrease the familywise error rate. We will first undertake superiority testing of the active treatment (2% soy milk) and the reference treatment (2% cow's milk) compared with the control treatment (SSB). The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle with inverse probability weighting (IPW) \[https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2215\] to account for missing values. Data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with significance set at a p \< 0.05. Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, per protocol, and ITT with multiple imputations (MI). If superiority is established in the primary analysis (confirming the ""assay sensitivity""), then we will undertake non-inferiority testing of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment using per protocol analysis. If the upper bound of the 90% CI is less than the 1.5% non-inferiority margin \[δ\] by difference of means, then the active treatment (2% soy milk) will be considered non-inferior to the reference treatment (2% cow's milk). If the upper bound of the 90% CI of the difference of means is less than both the 1.5% non-inferiority margin \[δ\] and the 0 value (unity), then the active treatment (2% soy milk) will be considered superior to the reference treatment (2% cow's milk). The primary analysis for non-inferiority will be a per protocol analysis. Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, ITT with IPW and ITT with MI.

Secondary, exploratory, and adherence outcomes will be assessed by superiority testing among the active treatment (2% soy milk), reference treatment (2% cow's milk), and control treatment (SSB).By reporting all estimated effects and confidence intervals with p-values, the necessary context is provided for a proper interpretation of the statistical evidence \[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108\]. If it is required for a future regulatory submission, then the secondary outcomes will be adjusted for false discovery. The approach will depend on the results of the primary outcome. If the superiority testing of the primary outcome is significant, then we will analyze the secondary outcomes using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling method with a starting alpha of 0.05 to correct for false discovery \[80\]. The sample size was selected to allow sufficient power for this analytical approach. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle with IPW to account for any missing values. Data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models for continuous data (mean differences with 95% CIs) and logistic regression models for categorical data (odds ratio with 95% CI for MetS reversion and relative risk with 95% CI for diabetes incidence). Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level of the end value. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, per protocol analyses, and ITT with MI.

Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted using Chi-square tests by age, sex, NAFLD status, caffeinated beverage use (cola vs non-cola drinkers), intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline waist circumference, FPG, 2hPG, Triglycerides, HDL-C, BP. Continuous linear (dose response gradient ) and non-linear (dose response threshold) dose-response analyses will be undertaken over the natural dose response range (3, 4, 5, or 6 servings per day) by multiple linear regression and piecewise regression analyses, respectively.

NCT04723160,Computer Aided Diagnosis of Multiple Eye Fundus Diseases From Color Fundus Photograph,"A Prospective, Multicenter, Blinded Reading, Self Controlled, Superiority Priority Clinical Trial of Assisted Fundus Image Diagnosis Software for the Diagnosis of Multiple Eye Fundus Diseases","Blindness can be caused by many ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia and glaucoma. Without timely diagnosis and adequate medical intervention, the visual impairment can become a great burden on individuals as well as the society. It is estimated that China has 110 million patients under the attack of diabetes, 180 million patients with hypertension, 120 million patients suffering from high myopia and 200 million people over 60 years old, which suggest a huge population at the risk of blindness. Despite of this crisis in public health, our society has no more than 3,000 ophthalmologists majoring in fundus oculi disease currently. As most of them assembling in metropolitan cities, health system in this field is frail in primary hospitals. Owing to this unreasonable distribution of medical resources, providing medical service to hundreds of millions of potential patients threatened with blindness is almost impossible.

To solve this problem, this software (MCS) was developed as a computer-aided diagnosis to help junior ophthalmologists to detect 13 major retina diseases from color fundus photographs. This study has been designed to validate the safety and efficiency of this device.","As a prospective clinical trial, This study enjoys multicentric, blind film reading, self-control and superiority test design. In total, 1,500 retinal fundus images from 750 individuals in need of fundus examination (one image for every single eye) were selected. Then a test group, along with a control group was set up in our study. For the test group, ophthalmologists read images with the aid of the assistant software(MCS). In contrast, the same work in the control group was finished by ophthalmologists independently. Meanwhile, the gold standard were obtained from the cooperation of senior ophthalmologists. Diagnoses of both groups were compared with those of the gold standard, thus the investigators could evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this assistant software in diagnosis.

The primary endpoint of this study is the superiority of the consistency rate of the test group. A diagnosis for an image is consistent if it gives the same negative result as the reference standard, or reveals any one condition indicated by the reference standard. The consistency rate is the rate of consistent diagnoses for all the involved images. One control group is designed, where each doctor reads and diagnoses, and give at most 3 possible conditions for each image. In the test group, doctors do the same thing with the help of this software. The investigators in the test group and control group are the same and they are chosen from ophthalmologists with 1\~3 years experience. The reference standard of each fundus image is collaboratively given by retinal specialists/fellows from 5 centers. The investigator of XieHe center is the arbitrator if full consensus cannot be reached for any image during the building of reference standard.",COMPLETED,,2020-08-10,2021-05-30,2021-03-10,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,748,ACTUAL

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare tumors. They usually form inside and near the adrenal gland or in the neck region. Not all these tumors can be removed with surgery, and there are no good treatments if the disease has spread. Researchers think a new drug may be able to help.

Objective:

To learn the safety and tolerability of Lu-177-DOTATATE. Also, to see if it improves the length of time it takes for the cancer to return.

Eligibility:

Adults who have an inoperable tumor of the study cancer that can be detected with Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

Eligible participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center.

Participants will get the study drug in an intravenous infusion. They will get 4 doses, given about 8 weeks apart.

Between 4 and 24 hours after each study drug dose, participants will have scans taken. They will lie on their back on a scanner table.

Participants will have vital signs taken. They will give blood and urine samples.

During the study, participants will have other scans taken. Some scans will use a radioactive tracer.

Participants will complete quality of life questionnaires.

Participants will be contacted by phone 1-3 days after they leave the Clinical Center. They will then be followed every 3 to 6 months for 3 years or until their disease gets worse.","Background:

* Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) are rare tumors arising from neural crest tissue that can develop in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia throughout the body. Those arising in the adrenal gland are called PHEOs while those located extra-adrenally are called PGLs.
* While benign and uni-focal, PHEO/PGL can be effectively treated with surgical resection, participants with metastatic PHEO/PGL often times have few effective and efficient treatment options with current treatments aimed more at palliation and symptom control. Furthermore, some benign head and neck PGLs may be inoperable because of their size and location.
* Somatostatin receptors (SSTR), especially type 2, have been shown to be over-expressed in a number of human tumors, including gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), carcinoids, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and PHEO/PGL among many others.
* Ionizing radiation such as the beta particles emitted by Lu-177 cause DNA damage to target cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In addition, ionizing radiation has also been shown to induce cell death through what is known as the bystander effect, a phenomenon where cellular signaling from irradiated cells towards non-irradiated cells induces cellular damage and eventually death in nearby surrounding cells.
* Lu-177-DOTATATE is a somatostatin analog that predominantly recognizes SSTR2. This reagent has been used extensively and its well-tolerated safety profile and efficacy has been shown in a variety of neuroendocrine tumors.

Primary Objective:

To assess the safety and to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-DOTATATE to improve upon progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months in participants with inoperable, SSTR positive PHEO/PGL by comparing PFS of participants treated with Lu-177-DOTATATE to historical controls from existing literature.

Eligibility:

* Histologically-proven, surgically inoperable, PHEO/PGL participants (both newly diagnosed or participants with existing diagnoses are eligible)
* Must have presence of SSTR+ disease as documented by positive Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan

  * Positivity of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan defined as having at least one lesion that is greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter with uptake that is higher than or equal to liver and is qualitatively higher and distinguishable from background activity.
  * Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1
* Age: greater than or equal to 18
* Karnofsky Performance Score greater than or equal to 60 or, ECOG Performance Status of 2 or better
* Able to understand and willing to sign informed consent

Design:

* Open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of Lu- 177-DOTATATE in the selected participant population divided into two cohorts: 1) SDHx cohort will include participants with the succinate dehydrogenase mutation, which is the most common and most aggressive genetic sub-group of participants with PHEO/PGL, and 2) apparent sporadic cohort which will include participants without a clear genetic mutation.
* Lu-177-DOTATATE is administered IV every 8 (+/- 2) weeks, for a total of 4 administrations. Gamma whole-body planar and/or SPECT/CT imaging of Lu-177-DOTATATE will be obtained at 4 to 72-hours post-injection to confirm localization of treatment to intended targets (optional for participating sites). A CT/MRI for RECIST, Ga-68-DOTATATE and F-18-FDG PETs will be obtained post-2 administrations and post-4 administrations.
* All participants will be contacted by phone within a week after each Lu-177-DOTATATE and in-person every 4 weeks. After the end of treatment visit at week 32, participant will continue to be followed every 12 weeks until 3 years after the first Lu-177-DOTATATE administration. Follow-up visits may be conducted remotely or via telemedicine. After the 3 years, all participants will be contacted yearly until death to assess survival and disease status.
* Participants who have met the primary endpoint of having achieved a PFS of at least 6 months after the initial treatment course, may be eligible to receive further cycles of Lu-177-DOTATATE at the time of progression.",RECRUITING,,2017-10-10,2027-01-01,2026-01-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,130,ESTIMATED

After the scans taken during the iNO treatment are performed some of the baseline assessments will be repeated whilst the patient is on iNO treatment (vital signs including oxygen saturation measurement, ABG, MetHb, 6MWD (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale will be executed and during the 6MWD the oxygen saturation will be measured), PRO, spirometry). During visit 1 the investigator will discontinue iNO to assess if rebound pulmonary hypertension occurs. In the first 2 patients, iNO therapy will be discontinued while 2D echo is performed to assess sPAP. Furthermore, NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured. In the remaining patients the following additional safety assessments (NIBP, HR, SpO2) will be performed while the patient is discontinued at least 20 minutes of iNO. If the investigator considers it is safe to restart the iNO-therapy, the patient will start chronic iNO treatment. After the results of the safety assessments of the 2 first patients are collected a safety meeting will be held to evaluate the results. Depending on the results, the additional 2D echo may be performed in additional patients. Subjects will be contacted via telephone or e-mail ± 24 hours after visit 1, for assessment of vital status, concomitant medications and the occurrence of new AEs or worsening of previously existing recorded AEs and PRO (= visit 2). After 2 weeks of treatment of iNO with a dosage of 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr during at least 12 hours a day patients will be asked to return to the site for visit 3. During that visit following measurements will be performed: patency of nares will be checked, vital signs including oxygen saturation measurement, MetHb, 6MWD (with Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), PRO and AE assessment. After 4 weeks treatment visit 4 will be conducted. 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler (immediately after the 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured) and HRCT scans with contrast agent under iNO pulse will be taken. Before the scans are taken an urine pregnancy test will be obtained, if applicable. A retest of the eGFR CKD-EPI value should also be performed before administering the contrast agent, if there is a clinical indication according to the investigator. Spirometry assessments will be performed, patency of nares, ECG, ABG, MetHb, 6MWD (with Borg CR10 fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), PRO will be assessed. After all assessments are completed, iNO will be discontinued. Twenty minutes after discontinuation of iNO-therapy, spirometry, PRO, MetHb, 6MWD (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale will be executed and during the 6MWD the oxygen saturation will be measured) and 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler measurements measurement will be repeated. Vital signs with oxygen saturation will be measured immediately after the 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler. After all the assessments the patient is placed back on his/her prescribed dose of LTOT using their usual cannula. The patient will be assessed for any signs of acute withdrawal. Therefore vital signs including oxygen saturation will be measured.

At visit 5, two weeks after discontinuation of iNO treatment repeat vital signs with oxygen saturation measurement, physical examination, patency of nares, spirometry, 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler (immediately after the 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured), ABG, MetHb, 6MWD(with Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), and PRO will be performed. If applicable a last urine pregnancy test will be executed to make sure no pregnancy occurred during the study. If there are no follow-up actions for a patient at this visit, it will be considered as a completion of study participation / end of study for that particular patient.",TERMINATED,This was an exploratory open-label study and has met its initial objectives,2016-10,2017-08-21,2017-08-21,INTERVENTIONAL,EARLY_PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,7,ACTUAL

NCT04094194,Meta-analysis of the Nordic Dietary Pattern on Cardiometabolic Risk and Cardiovascular Outcomes,Relation of the Nordic Dietary Pattern With Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Incident Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Prospective Cohort Studies,"The Nordic Diet is a dietary pattern rich in traditional Nordic foods, including berries, grains, and fatty fish common in northern Europe. Studies have shown a protective effect of the Nordic Diet on cardiometabolic risk factors, however only select clinical practice guidelines for the management of diabetes (i.e. Diabetes Canada) recommend this dietary pattern. To support the update of the EASD clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and clinical trials to investigate the association between the Nordic Diet, cardiometabolic outcomes and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. The findings generated by this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing evidence-based guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.","Background: Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a traditional dietary pattern of the wider region of the Mediterranean sea, has been associated with favourable cardiometabolic outcomes, including the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, limited local food availability, increased cost or unfamiliar culture and tradition render the Mediterranean diet difficult to follow in the northern European environment. The Nordic Diet or those of other traditional diets of the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Faeroe islands) are dietary patterns rich in traditional Nordic foods, including berries, grains, and fatty fish common in northern Europe. The Nordic Diet has been associated with favorable cardiometabolic outcomes including improved lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These benefits have been recognized in the most recent updates of the clinical practice guidelines for diabetes in Canada. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) has not included the Nordic dietary pattern in their guidelines.

Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts represent high-quality evidence to support dietary guidelines and public health policy. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted towards food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing the role of the Nordic diet in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic outcomes and cardiovascular diseases.

Objectives: To support the update of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts using the GRADE approach on the Nordic dietary pattern on cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies will be conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.

Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of references of included studies.

Study selection: Randomized controlled trials conducted in humans with a follow-duration ≥ 3 week investigating the effect of a Nordic diet on cardiometabolic outcomes will be included. Studies that are not conducted in humans, not randomized, have an acute feeding design (\<3 weeks), lack a suitable control (non-isocaloric) and/or do not report viable endpoint data will not be included. Prospective cohort studies with greater than 1-year of follow-up will be included.

Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized clinical trials and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for prospective cohorts. All disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data for the randomized clinical. Risk ratios, odds ratios and hazard ratios for clinical outcomes in the prospective cohort studies will be extracted or derived from clinical event data across exposure to a Nordic diet.

Outcomes: For the randomized clinical trials, the primary outcome will be LDL-cholesterol. Secondary outcomes will include markers of glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin); other blood lipids (non-HDL-C, apo B, HDL-C, triglycerides); adiposity (body weight, BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and inflammation (C-reactive protein \[CRP\]).

For prospective cohorts, the primary outcome will be incident CVD Secondary outcomes include incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and incident stroke.

Data synthesis:

Trials: Data will be pooled by the generic inverse-variance method with DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects models were used as they account for residual heterogeneity and yield more conservative estimates. Fixed-effects models will be used for \<5 trials. Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are ≥10 trials, we will explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by study design (parallel or crossover), follow-up duration (\<12 weeks or ≥12 weeks), comparator diet, baseline measurements, risk of bias, disease duration, and funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, diet quality index, composition of the background diet \[total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein\]). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When ≥10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

Prospective cohort studies: Natural log-transformed relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) of clinical outcomes, comparing extreme quantiles (the highest exposure versus the lowest exposure or reference group), will be pooled separately using the generic inverse variance method with random effects models and expressed as RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If ≥10 cohort comparisons were available, then we will perform an a-priori subgroup analyses by meta-regression for follow-up (\<10 years vs. ≥10 years), sex (males vs. females, males vs. mixed, females vs. mixed), study quality (NOS \<6 vs. ≥6) and funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses. Linear and non-linear dose-response relations will be explored with the use of random-effects generalised least-squares trend estimation (GLST) models and spline curve modeling (MKSPLINE procedure), respectively. When ≥10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

Evidence assessment: The certainty of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future guidelines.

Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation to the role of the Nordic Diet in cardiovascular disease prevention and management, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.",UNKNOWN,,2017-12-01,2019-12-01,2019-12-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1,ESTIMATED

Patients with liver cirrhosis and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who will need to undergo systemic therapy will be enrolled. Patients in the first phase will undergo measurement of liver and spleen stiffness and upper endoscopic evaluation and will subsequently be followed for 12 months","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) frequently coexist, affecting cirrhotic individuals' prognosis. Recently it has been confirmed that in cirrhotic patients with favorable Baveno VI consensus (platelets\>150000/mm3 and liver stiffness measurement (LSM\<20 kPa) or combined model based on spleen stiffness, endoscopic screening for varices could be avoided. The Portal Hypertension (PH)-related complications in all patients should be avoided and well managed, especially if they have advanced HCC (aHCC) at diagnosis. However, unlike patients without HCC, endoscopy is recommended for those who undergo systemic therapy, even if compatible with favorable Baveno VI consensus . The reasons for this indication derive from the consideration that the presence of HCC could influence the measurement of LSM and platelet count.

To date, in cirrhotic patients without HCC, according to Baveno VII consensus and the last EASL guidelines for non-invasive tests (NITs), besides LSM, Spleen Stiffness Measurement (SSM) is now considered the most accurate NITs for assessing portal hypertension and predicting the presence of esophageal varices (EVs) and varices needing treatment (VNT).

To date, no studies have evaluated the accuracy of NITs (LSM/SSM) on patients with advanced HCC (aHCC) who should undergo systemic therapy.

The study aims to assess the performance of SSM to rule out VNT in patients with aHCC who undergo systemic therapy.

Each center will prospectively collect data according to an electronic e-CFR on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system, a web application designed to support data capture for research studies in a secure manner.",ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,,2023-06-20,2025-10,2025-06-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,150,ESTIMATED
NCT00005760,"Health Effects of Liposuction in Overweight Women With Elevated Insulin Levels, Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes","A Pilot Study of the Metabolic Effects of Large Volume Liposuction in Overweight Women With Hyperinsulinemia, Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes","This study is for women who have already decided to undergo liposuction at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. To take part in this study, a woman must first meet with the plastic surgeons there, and be accepted by them to have liposuction. This study will investigate whether large volume liposuction improves risk factors for heart disease in overweight women with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or elevated blood insulin levels. Large volume liposuction is the surgical removal of at least 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of body fat, usually from the abdomen, hips or chest. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure and elevated levels of blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), blood glucose (sugar), and blood insulin. Subjects who participate in all parts of this study will receive a total of $930.00.

Overweight women 18 years or older with high blood insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes, who are planning to have large volume liposuction performed at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., may be eligible for this study. For a subject to be accepted into this study, she must first meet with the plastic surgeons at Georgetown University Medical Center, and they have to agree to perform large volume liposuction. The decision that someone is suitable for liposuction is not under the control of the NIH or of any NIH investigator.

Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures at four separate times - before undergoing liposuction, 4 weeks after surgery, 4 months after surgery and 1 year after surgery:

* Body measurements - taken with calipers to measure several skinfold thicknesses (the width of a fat fold) and with a tape measure to measure the circumference of parts of the body.
* Urine sample and 6-hour urine collection - to test for pregnancy and to evaluate kidney function.
* Glucose tolerance test - measures insulin sensitivity and how the body uses sugar, how well insulin works, and insulin sensitivity. The procedure involves placement of two catheters (thin, flexible tubes) through a needle into a vein in each arm. Sugar water is infused into one catheter and 20 minutes into the test a small amount of insulin is injected. Blood samples are drawn from the other catheter at frequent intervals for a total of 5 hours.
* Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography - measure the heart's electrical activity and function.
* Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan - produces images for measuring body fat in the abdomen. (not done at the 4-week visit). Takes about half an hour to complete.
* DXA X-ray - measures body fat, muscle and bone mineral content. Takes about half an hour to complete.
* Bod Pod - capsule-like device used to determine the proportion of body weight composed of fat and non-fat tissue. Takes less than 10 minutes
* Bioelectric impedance analysis device - measures the proportions of body fat based on electrical conduction of a small electric current. Takes 2-3 minutes.
* 24-hour blood pressure monitoring - a device attached to a blood pressure cuff strapped to the arm measures blood pressure every 15 to 30 minutes continuously for 24 hours.
* Vascular reactivity tests - a blood pressure cuff is inflated for about 4 minutes before deflating, providing information on the function of the small blood vessels in the skin, as well as an idea of the function level of small blood vessels elsewhere in the body. Takes half an hour.
* Blood samples - collected to evaluate kidney and liver function and to measure body lipids, such as cholesterol, minerals, and other substances.","Obesity is a major predisposing factor for future Type 2 diabetes because it is often associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has been suggested as the common link for other aspects of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome that includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and macrovascular arterial disease. There are racial disparities in the prevalence of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes: Compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians, African American women have almost twice the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.

Because data from predominantly Caucasian populations suggest that the quantity of truncal (sometimes called upper body) adipose tissue, which includes the adipose tissue surrounding the abdominal viscera, is far more important for risk stratification than that found in the limbs or buttocks, which contain subcutaneous adipose tissue, it has been presumed that attempts at treatment of obesity should concentrate on reducing visceral fat. However, despite their greater risks for the complications of obesity, African Americans have less visceral abdominal adipose tissue than Caucasians matched for body weight. Further, recent metabolic studies suggest that upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play a significant role, particularly for African Americans, in the comorbid metabolic conditions associated with obesity.

With the advent of the large volume liposuction technique, selective removal of substantial quantities of subcutaneous adipose tissue has become possible. It is unknown whether the complications of obesity can be ameliorated by removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but one preliminary study suggests that fasting hyperinsulinism can be improved by this approach.

We propose to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients (five Caucasians and five African-Americans) who plan to undergo liposuction. We will investigate how large volume liposuction affects the metabolic complications of obesity in overweight patients who have hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. We will investigate the effects of liposuction on various indices of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome by performing studies of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism at four time points: before large volume liposuction, 1 month after liposuction, 4 months after liposuction, and 1 year after liposuction. At each visit we will study body composition, blood pressure, cardiac function, dietary habits, insulin insensitivity, free fatty acids, and lipid profiles.",COMPLETED,,2000-05,2002-01,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,10,

NCT06543394,Engaging Patients in Adherence Interventions Using Behavioral Science,Optimizing Recruitment Methodology for Medication Adherence Interventions: The ENGaging Patients in Adherence Interventions UsinG Behavioral SciencE (ENGAGE) Randomized Factorial Trial,"The overarching goal of the proposed research is to prepare an evidence-based clinical pharmacist-delivered medication adherence intervention for sustainable implementation and dissemination. Because the effectiveness of the intervention has already been demonstrated in a NIH Stage Model Stage 4 trial called STIC2IT, this study will include an NIH Stage Model Stage 5 Effectiveness-Implementation Type 3 Hybrid design, in which the primary focus is on testing different implementation methods, while secondarily observing clinical effects. The overarching hypothesis is that investigators can identify the most impactful elements of a behavioral theory-informed recruitment approach, which can be replicable across clinical settings.

Accordingly, this study will perform testing of behaviorally-informed recruitment approaches in a primary care setting that serves patients from under-resourced communities. Patients will be English or Spanish speaking adults ≥18 years of age identified through the electronic health record (EHR) as having a primary care clinician at the participating practice as well as uncontrolled hypertension and suboptimal adherence to blood pressure medications based on pharmacy fill data linked to the electronic health record (EHR). The primary care clinicians of eligible patients identified through the EHR will have the opportunity to opt-out any patients they wish not to be included. Patients will then be randomized to each of the following conditions, such that there will be 8 total arms: (1) inclusion of a mailer primer (yes/no), (2) the most successful recruitment letter from a preliminary study using prospect theory (versus the control letter), and (3) intensity of the intervention outreach (up to 4 calls vs. up to 2 calls).

Patients across all arms who agree to be scheduled will receive an appointment with one of the clinical pharmacists trained in the brief negotiated interviewing approach used in the STIC2IT trial. The primary outcome will be completion of a clinical pharmacist appointment within 12 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes will include scheduled visit rates, no-show rates for scheduled appointments, pharmacy fill adherence to statins and blood pressure medications over the 3-month follow-up, and clinical outcomes, including blood pressure as per EHR data in the 3 months after randomization.","Participants will be recruited from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)-affiliated primary care clinics that are part of the New York Presbyterian (NYP) Ambulatory Care Network (ACN). These clinics provide care to patients in the catchment area of CUIMC which is notable for substantial racial, ethnic, and economic diversity. The study team will identify participants with uncontrolled hypertension (last office BP \<140/90 mmHg) who also are nonadherent (PDC\<80%) to at least one antihypertensive medication class and meet other study eligibility criteria.

Participants will then be randomized using a 2\^3 factorial approach to each of the following conditions, such that there will be 8 total arms: (1) inclusion of a mailer primer (yes vs no), (2) a behavioral theory-informed letter script (vs usual scripted letter), and (3) intensity of the recruitment outreach (up to 4 calls vs up to 2 calls). Recruitment outreach will be conducted by members of the study team, who will be trained to deliver different interventions based on a patient's assigned arm. Enrollment will be staggered over an approximately 4-month period so as not to overwhelm the scheduling staff and mimic how quality improvement programs are conducted in typical practice.

Participants who agree to participate in the adherence counseling session after receiving any of the 8 combinations of recruitment strategies will be scheduled to receive a brief evidence-based medication adherence counseling session known as brief negotiated interviewing. Patients who schedule a counseling session with a clinical pharmacist will receive a reminder call before their appointment. This will involve a 30-minute or less telephone or video visit with a nurse or clinical pharmacist who will use a semi-structured guide to confirm the patient's treatment regimen, engage them in sharing potential barriers to adherence or other factors that may be contributing to poor disease control, discuss their readiness to modify behaviors, and work with the patient to develop a shared plan.

The study will concurrently test whether 1) inclusion of a mailed primer is better than no inclusion, 2) whether use of a behavioral theory-informed message-framing strategy in the recruitment letter is better than the usual approach that does not include theory-informed message framing in a recruitment letter, and 3) whether increasing the intensity of recruitment outreach after the letter through up to 4 phone calls is better than up to 2 phone calls. The primary outcome for the study will be whether or not patients completed the adherence counseling session within 12 weeks of randomization.

The only known way to reduce the rate of disease progression is by reducing the pressure in the eye (the intraocular pressure, IOP). Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is an ophthalmic laser intervention with the purpose of reducing the IOP.

SLT can be performed in different ways, with four of the treatment protocols being evaluated in the Optimal SLT (OSLT) trial.

SLT is a repeatable procedure, but scientific evidence is scarce regarding more than one repetition. In this trial, patients included in the OSLT trial will be invited to the extended trial (OSLT-R), for further follow-up and re-treatment with SLT, if needed.","Subjects already included in the OSLT trial (NCT03798223) will be invited to the extended trial (OSLT-R) at the time of SLT re-treatment or when OSLT follow up is scheduled to terminate. Patients are re-treated as needed, according to the randomized group assignment performed in the OSLT inclusion process.

The OSLT-R trial is aiming to elucidate:

* If the SLT efficacy, in terms of relative IOP reduction (percent of baseline IOP), changes with additional SLT iterations.
* If the longevity of IOP reduction after SLT changes with additional SLT iterations.
* If repeated SLT is associated with a change in postoperative discomfort or adverse events.

All of the above will be analyzed within each of the four treatment groups (SLT protocols) in the trial. Further, analysis will also be conducted regarding differences between the treatment groups regarding the above.

NCT01451060,Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes of the Use of Vasopressors to Treat Hypotension During Spinal Anesthesia for Cesarean,Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes After the Use of Vasopressors to Correct Hypotension During Cesarean Section Under Spinal Anesthesia in Pregnant Women With Severe Preeclampsia: Randomized Clinical Trial,"Anesthesia for cesarean section has been a great challenge for the anesthesiologist, for mother and fetus are closely related. So the challenge is to anesthetize the mother without interfering with the physiology of the fetus. The spinal block, although safe, are not free of complications if not treated properly, may be responsible for increased fetal morbidity. Among the major side effects, there is hypotension, with potentially serious consequences for the maternal-fetal dyad. Hypotension in pregnant women at low risk may not lead to major damage, but a pregnant woman with low reserves, as is the case of pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, any drop in blood pressure of the mother can bring harm to the welfare of mother and fetus. Based on the above, the purpose of this study is to compare the effects of maternal and perinatal treatment of hypotension with ephedrine or metaraminol in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. There will be a randomized, double-blind, which will be included pregnant women with severe preeclampsia with indication of cesarean section, gestational age above 34 weeks gestation and only.Will be Excluded women with hemorrhagic syndromes of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, eclampsia, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, fetal distress and absolute contraindications to spinal anesthesia.

All patients are fully informed of the research objectives and will only be included in the study if they agree to participate and sign the Instrument of Consent. The project was designed following the recommendations of Resolution 196/96 of the National Health and the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects (2000). In addition, the project was submitted to the Ethics Committee in Research of the Institute of Integrative Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira, is approved. The study will be conducted from June 2011 to July 2012. The study variables are: consumption of metaraminol and ephedrine before and after birth, the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, incidence of maternal hypotension, the occurrence of reactive hypertension, occurrence of bradycardia, pH of umbilical cord, Apgar score 5 minutes, need for face mask ventilation and ICU admission.","Ephedrine, a long time was considered the safest drug for both mother and fetus during the treatment of hypotension in Caesarean section. However, recent evidence shows that contrary to what was thought, ephedrine appears to increase fetal metabolism, decreasing the pH and excess base.

Recently, phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of hypotension during cesarean delivery with better results in relation to acid-base parameters in umbilical cord blood. However, few data are available on the use of phenylephrine in high-risk pregnancy, the majority of studies in healthy pregnant women for elective caesarean section.

Although little scientific evidence regarding the use of metaraminol for treatment of hypotension in Caesarean section, recent study demonstrated superiority of this drug compared to ephedrine, checking a lower incidence of neonatal acidosis and better control of blood pressure. The researchers also found differences in blood gases from the umbilical cord between the ephedrine and metaraminol groups larger than those already found in previous studies comparing ephedrine and phenylephrine.

The pathophysiological changes in patients with pre-eclampsia can lead to intrauterine growth restriction with chronic fetal distress, due to the limited uteroplacental flow, which, in certain situations, may be reduced by 50% to 70%. Added to this, spinal anesthesia may cause sudden hypotension and fetal acidosis more often, even in elective operations, compared to epidural or general anesthesia, and that these changes may not have clinical significance in healthy fetuses at term, but may be critical in situations where arterial insufficiency uteroplacental and fetal distress already to present. It is believed, therefore, important that treat or prevent hypotension in patients with severe preeclampsia under spinal anesthesia.

Prevention of hypotension in patients with severe preeclampsia does not require large amounts of intravenous fluids, but careful prophylaxis of postural hypotensive syndrome. Despite the care, if hypotension occurs, aggressive treatment is mandatory in these patients and fast in order to avoid worsening fetal distress and neonatal depression. Such patients are more sensitive to vasopressors, therefore, small doses should be administered.

However, the biggest challenge of the anesthesiologist is to determine the ideal vasopressor in pregnant women at high risk, able to adequately restore blood pressure levels without determining deterioration of fetal status.

30 Reynolds and Seed in 2005 showed that ephedrine, administered in large doses, has contributed to the adverse effects of spinal anesthesia (greater degree of fetal metabolic acidosis), supporting the idea that ephedrine is not the vasopressor of choice for treatment of maternal hypotension during cesarean section.

As a result, this study is to fill this knowledge gap, taking on great importance to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with severe preeclampsia to receive ephedrine or metaraminol for treatment of maternal hypotension during caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Considering the importance of creating a protocol, since the metaraminol, unlike phenylephrine, is widely available at our facility.",WITHDRAWN,We didn't have enough financial support,2011-06,2014-07,2014-06,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,0,ACTUAL

NCT04607876,Family at Risk Study,Family at Risk Study,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors include hypertension as a key risk factor, as well as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, obesity, diet, inactivity, family history and age. These are highly prevalent in the US population with risk factor control far from optimal.1-3 Hypertension affects approximately 30% of adults and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) supports population screening.4 Many individuals have multiple risk factors, with declining rates of control with an increasing numbers of risk factors,5 but greater benefit through the control of multiple risk factors.6 Prior approaches to primary and primordial ASCVD risk mitigation generally fail to target motivated populations for identification and modification of risk factors. Data from the ongoing project C3FIT has shown first-degree relatives of a stroke patient are such a highly motivated population, having seen the end result of failed ASCVD risk control in their relative. Also, family history of stroke or heart disease is an independent risk factor for ASCVD including stroke and heart attack7-11 and there is a family risk-factor clustering putting this group at higher risk.12-14 However, current clinical practice does not seize the opportunity to assess and intervene on the family members of individuals with stroke or CAD despite their being enriched with individuals at elevated risk and high motivation to reduce that risk.

The Family at Risk (FAR) Trial targets this high-risk/high-motivation population of the biological offspring and siblings of an index stroke patient. FAR will evaluate two strategies for risk factor control: 1) FAR-Education/Coaching Arm (FAR-EC Arm): providing education from the American Heart/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) and coaching on risk factor control, versus 2) FAR-Enhanced Intervention Arm (FAR-EI Arm): the education and coaching strategy described above plus a combined virtual and in-person m-health management strategy to modify ASCVD risk factors using HealthStream/Harmonize technology. This supplemental management includes a home-based and family-focused participant-centric strategy for identification of ASCVD risk factors, education tailored to participant needs, and implementation of a technology-enabled m-health management strategy. This management strategy, known as ""Harmonize"" was shown to efficiently manage risk factors in Project Trident (Remote Patient Monitoring Pilot for High Risk Patients, IRB#: 2018-0063-HCP; Nov 2018 - Nov 2020) that aimed to improve control of cardiovascular risk factors in an eldery (mean age = 79 years), racially mixed, primary prevention population (Pulicharam, publication in process).

Adoption of research into a clinical environment depends not only on the efficacy of the therapy, but the quality of the evidence supporting its utilization, and the acceptance of the therapy to patients and caregivers. Major national groups have low level evidence supporting real world approaches to management of these risk factors (USPSTF recommendations ""Insufficient"" or ""B"" or ""C""). While specifically not developing a guideline, FAR seeks to fill that gap with high quality research data that will inform guidelines and health system approaches to primary prevention, and assess the acceptability of approaches to the affected participant population; leading to dissemination of study results to a real-world setting. By incorporating input from patients, physicians (internal medicine, primary care, and neurology), nurses, and the AHA in the design, implementation, and dissemination of study results, study investigators anticipate good acceptance of study results. FAR will inform key stakeholders (stroke patients, their first-degree relatives, and the healthcare system) regarding the prevalence and impact of family history as an ASCVD risk factor, and how best to mitigate that risk. This effort will be conducted in two phases. During the feasibility phase, the relatives of stroke patients will be assessed regarding their current level of recognition of risk, their willingness to engage in risk measurement, the feasibility of remote monitoring, educational and behavioral factors that would lead to behavior change. Simultaneously, primary care physicians (PCPs) will be assessed regarding perceptions of care gaps, feasibility of use of the chronic disease management technology,20 and design features that might present issues; with development and testing of educational and motivational materials and content.

Inflammation is one mechanism by which diabetes and elevated cholesterol damage blood vessels. Inflammation can be increased by oxidative stress. This study will see if Alpha Lipoic acid, a potent antioxidant and over the counter product, reduces blood levels of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation when compared with placebo. Placebo is a substance that looks like the real product, but contains no active product.","This is a randomized study. A randomized study means you will be assigned by chance (like the toss of a coin) to one of four groups and receive either alpha lipoic acid (ALA or placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the real drug). In this study, there is a 1 out of 4 chance you will receive placebo. Three of the groups will receive different doses of ALA and one group will receive placebo only. The groups are: placebo only, 600 mg ALA, 1200 mg ALA, and 1800 mg ALA a day. At some point all study participants will receive placebo; sometimes the pills will be ALA and sometimes they will be placebo. You will not know which you are taking on any given day.

This study is also double-blinded, which means that you, the study doctor, and the Sponsor will not know until the end of the study whether you are receiving ALA or placebo only. Your study doctor can find out if you are receiving ALA or placebo if needed in an emergency.

If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to come in for up to 6 visits in 12 weeks. You should be fasting before some of these visits. Fasting means that you should have nothing to eat or drink, except water with your usual morning medications, for 10 hours before your scheduled study visit. The study staff will go over this with you each time.

Visit 1-Screening: (about 3 hours)

• Please fast before this visit

In order to find out if you qualify to take part in the study, you will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:

* Your health history will be taken
* Your height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured
* You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* You will give fasting blood samples of about 3-5 tablespoons and urine samples
* If you are female and can have children, you will be given a urine pregnancy test
* You will take a glucose tolerance test (GTT) A dietitian will briefly discuss your diet and exercise. An ECG will be done to measure your heart function. ECG measures the electrical activity of your heart. You will be asked to lie down and small sticky pads will be placed on your arms, legs, and across your chest.

The GTT test involves collecting 1 blood sample before, and 4 samples up to 2 hours after, you drink a measured amount of glucose (a sugar) in a pleasant tasting liquid. You will have 2 tablespoons of blood drawn. An indwelling intravenous (IV) needle will be inserted into your vein for the 2-hour period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.

Depending on the results of your blood and urine tests, you may be asked to come in for a second visit in about 1 week. The screening blood tests may provide you with information on your health that could be important to you, for example diagnosing diabetes.

VISIT 2: (about 1 hour)

• You do not have to fast for this visit and may take your morning medications as usual

You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:

- You will meet with a dietician for an assessment of your eating habits. The dietitian will advise you on how to maintain a stable diet during the study.

* If your blood tests indicate that you have diabetes, you will receive instructions on diet and exercise to improve your blood sugar levels.
* If your HbA1c level is high, you will be given a home glucose monitoring device (glucometer) with instructions on its use for daily testing. HbA1c is a measure of average glucose levels over the prior few weeks.
* You will be given a 2-week supply of study drug and asked to stop any over- the-counter vitamins that you are taking until you have completed this study. We will provide 3 bottles of study medicine at a time. Each bottle will be uniquely identified for use in the morning, midday or evening. You will be asked to take 2 tablets from the morning bottle, then 2 from the midday bottle and 2 from the evening bottle. You will also be given a daily multivitamin to take. This will be a total of 7 tablets a day for 10 weeks.

All unused study drug should be returned when you come in for the next visit in 2 weeks. It is important that you are able to take all the study drug. If we find that you are unable to take most of the study drug, you will be removed from the study.

VISIT 3: (about 6-8 hours)

•

* Please be fasting and do not have alcohol or exercise for 48 hours prior to the visit. You may be asked to withhold some of your usual medicines on this day but bring the doses to the visit with you to be taken at a later time. You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:
* Brachial artery ultrasound: This is a way to see how the walls of your arteries respond to change in blood flow. For this test, you will lie on a bed and we will take sound wave pictures of the artery in your elbow area. After the initial pictures, we will then inflate a blood pressure cuff on your upper arm for 5 minutes. As soon as the cuff is deflated more pictures of the same artery are taken. We will give then give you a pill called nitroglycerine to dissolve under your tongue. When the pill dissolves in a few minutes, final pictures of the same artery will be taken.
* The brachial test will be repeated 2 hours after a high fat meal is eaten. We will give the meal to you It will contain known amounts of fat,carbohydrates, and protein.
* Augmentation index: This is a test to see how stiff the walls of your artery may be. A small microphone will record the signal from the artery in your wrist for about 5 minutes.
* Several samples of blood (2 tablespoons) will be taken before you eat the high fat meal and when the second brachial test is completed. An indwelling IV needle may be inserted into your vein during this period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.
* DEXA scan. DEXA is a 4-5 minute x-ray body scan that provides accurate body fat mass measurements.If you are a woman who can have children, you will have a urine pregnancy test. If you are pregnant you will NOT be able to have the DEXA scan.
* A dietician will assist you with food questionnaire about your usual diet.
* A 4-week supply of study drug will be given to you with instructions on how to take it. Please bring any remaining study drug bottles with you to your next visit.

Visit 4: telephone call. You will also be asked about your ability and willingness to continue to take the study medicine until the end of the study.

Thirty minutes after ingesting 2g of green tea or placebo, they performed treadmill walking (60 minutes), 60 to 85% of maximum heart rate intensity in procedures with exercises. BP was measured at rest and at every 10 minutes after exercise (60 minutes). Blood samples were taken before the ingestion of green tea or placebo and immediately after exercise to determine Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Nitrite (NO) dosages. Reduction of systolic BP compared with the rest, during PL+Ex recovery procedure.","Subjects of study: Double- blind study, randomized and placebo, conduced with fifteen both sexes hypertensive individuals, physically active and practitioners of exercises for at least 3 months prior to trials. All patients were users of anti- hypertensive medication except beta- blockers and maintained medication throughout study period. They were demanded not to be diabetic and women not menopaused. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research with Human Beings of the Health Sciences Centre at the Federal University of Paraiba- CEP/ CCS, under the protocol 0120/13. Individuals were required to sign The Free and Clarified Consent Term (FCCT), according to resolution 196/96 of National Health Council.

Study Designs: subjects performed three experimental procedures, two practicing aerobic exercises and one without physical exercises. The sessions with exercises were conducted under previous administration of a green tea dosage or placebo (GT+Ex or PL+Ex), ingested 30 minutes before the start of exercises protocol. In the session without exercises (GT) they ingested green tea and remained sit during the same period destined to the exercises. Heart Rate Measurement were registered at rest (RHR) and in every ten minutes during physical exercise protocol. BP measurements were taken before (at rest), immediately after exercise and in every ten minutes during a recovery period of 60 minutes after the end of exercise protocol, or in the period they remained sit. Blood samples were collected prior and immediately after exercise or period without exercise for analysis of plasmatic concentration of anti and pro- oxidant agents (nitrite- NO and Malondialdehyde- MDA).

Instruments and Procedures:Physical Exercises: After the purposes of the research were clarified to the individuals, they were invited to proceed to the laboratory in order for exercise sessions performance. The groups were submitted to three sessions, two of those on treadmill aerobic exercise during 60 minutes. Furthermore, it was established that the individuals should practice exercises scoring between 11 and 14 in Borg and Noble's Subjective Perceived Exertion Scale. They were requested to hold the intensity of physical exercises from 60% to 85% of HRmax (maximum Heart Rate), monitored during sessions with a Polar frequency meter model RS800CX (Polar ElectroOy, Kempele, Finland).

Supplementation of Green Tea or Placebo: Green tea and placebo capsules were produced in a compounding laboratory. The investigators used 2g of green tea dried leaves and discovered an improvement in oxidative stress. The group with green tea consumption ingested capsules with 2g of concentrated powder, approximately 1960mg in polyphenols (636mg of epigallocatechin gallate) and 20mg of caffeine; placebo group consumed capsules containing 2g of cornstarch powder, all swallowed with water. Capsules were administered to patients after a skilled professional collected blood samples. Researchers conducted supplementation of substances after pre- exercise blood collection and sessions initiated only 30 minutes after the ingestion of capsules, which is the time required by the body to absorb nutrients.

Blood Pressure Measurement: Individuals had their BPs checked previously, immediately after the end of the exercise and during 60 minutes post- exercise. BP at rest was verified after the subjects remained sit for 10 minutes. By the end of the walking session, BP was checked with sitting subjects. During recovery, BP was verified in every 10 minutes during all 60 minutes of walking session. The protocol adopted was the one proposed by the Brazilian Society of Cardiology and the Brazilian Society of Hypertension.

Blood Collection Protocol: Performed prior and immediately after exercise. Ten milliliters (ml) of blood were collected from the antecubital vein, of which five ml were placed in test tubes containing EDTA and carefully homogenized by inversion. The other five ml were placed in tubes without any anticoagulant. Then they were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 minutes. Plasma was isolated, placed in ependorf tubes and refrigerated in 20 ºC until analysis.

Evaluation of oxidative stress (MDA): Oxidizing activity was quantified through thiobarbituric acid reaction with the products from hydroperoxides decomposition. Therefore, 250 µl of sample was added to KCl and incubated in water bath maintained at 37° C for 60 minutes. Then mixture was precipitated with 35% AA perchloric and centrifuged at 14000 rpm and 4°C for 10 minutes. Supernatant was transferred to new ependorfs, adding 400 µl of 0.6% thiobarbituric acid and incubated at 95-100° C for 30 min. After cooling, material was read by spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 532nm.

Nitrite Dosage The method was based on the Griess reagent usage. Reagent was prepared utilizing equal parts of 5% phosphoric acid, 0.1% N-1-naphthalenediamine (NEED), 1% sulphanilamide, 5% in phosphoric acid and distilled water. To accomplish the test, 100 µl of 10% homogenate supernatant made with potassium phosphate buffer was added to 100µl Griess reagent. Regarding the white one, 100 µl reagent was added to 100 µl of buffer and series of dilutions were conducted to obtain standard curve (100, 50, 25 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56 µm) of nitrite. The entire test was executed in a 96 well- plate template with reader at an absorbance range of 560 nm.

NCT03890627,Thoracic Bio-reactance Measurement of Cardiac Output in Pulmonary Hypertension,Interest of Cardiac Output Measurement by Thoracic Bio-reactance for Monitoring of Patients Treated for a Pulmonary Hypertension,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a rare disease characterized by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to a progressive decline in cardiac output (CO).Since cardiac output is correlated with the prognosis of the disease, the conduct of a right heart catheterization (thermodilution measurement, reference technique) during the annual follow-up visit of patients in competences centres is recommended. In practice, it is not systematically performed because of it is invasive, with potential risk for the patient, and there is limited logistical capacity for its implementation. The estimation of cardiac output is thus often based on cardiac ultrasound but its measurement is potentially biased.

Starling ™ SV is a non-invasive cardiac output monitor based on thoracic bio-reactance measurement. Several clinical studies have shown that cardiac output measured by bio-reactance is strongly correlated with the measurement obtained by catheterization in different indications. Rich et al. (2013) assessed bio-reactance specifically in 50 patients with Pulmonary Hypertension compared with thermodilution. The results showed that the measurement of cardiac output by bio-reactance was feasible in these patients, had a better accuracy than by catheterization, and was reliable for detecting changes in cardiac output after a vasodilatation test.

The Starling ™ SV monitor could thus have a place in the follow-up of patients who are being treated for Pulmonary Hypertension. Since it is a rapid, non-invasive examination, it could be performed on an outpatient basis, especially as a first-line test to check the stability of the CO, thus avoiding the systematic use of right heart catheterization, which would then be reserved only to patients for whom the measurement by bio-reactance would show a decrease of cardiac output compared to the previous value. Before being able to propose this use in current practice, it is necessary to carry out a pilot study which will make it possible to explore the interest of bio-reactance in this situation.",,COMPLETED,,2019-05-21,2022-05-31,2022-05-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,60,ACTUAL
NCT04554160,Arrhythmias in Pulmonary Hypertension Assessed by Continuous Long-term Cardiac Monitoring,ArrhythmiaS in Pulmonary arterIal hypeRtEnsion and Right Heart Failure Assessed by Continuous Long-term Cardiac Monitoring,"Arrhythmias are considered a prominent phenomenon in pulmonary hypertension (PH) as the disease progresses. According primarily to retrospective studies with up to 24 hours of monitoring, supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) can be found in 8-35% of patients, with significant impact on survival.

Furthermore, a few prospective studies to date deploying short-term monitoring (10 minutes-24 hours) have revealed lower heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

In ASPIRE arrhythmias and heart rate variability is being assessed via long term monitoring.

Currently the the loop-recorder is considered the gold standard for long-term continuous cardiac montoring. A non-invasive continuous monitoring could be of a great benefit for the patients, and could potentially contribute to treatment optimization.

The study will assess apple watches as a non-invasive tool compared to to the loop recorder, which is considered as the current gold standard.

Additionally, the study seeks to assess apple watches for monitoring as an independent wearable for risk assessment in PH.","In general there is a lack of evidence of the arrhythmic burden in PH. The present study is the first to apply continuous long-term cardiac monitoring in patients with PH to describe the prevalence of arrhythmias in PH by continuous long-term cardiac monitoring. Furthermore, the correlation between heart rate variability and risk assessment parameters including WHO functional class (FC), NT-proBNP, 6MWT, cardiac parameters and cardiac function will be studies.

A few prospective studies have demonstrated lower HRV in PH than in healthy individuals, however only based on short-term monitoring (20 minutes to 24 hour) and only in a few patients. In retrospective studies, a higher mortality in children with PAH and low HRV has been shown with 24 hour Holter monitoring. Consequently, there is a lack of evidence regarding right heart failure and the prognostic value of HRV.

Risk assessment in PH is essential in the selection of treatment in PH and for prognosis in the study ASPIRE the investigators will assess the use of heart rate variability in pulmonary hypertension.

In conclusion the ASPIRE study will:

1. Assess the incidence and prevalence of arrhythmias using long term cardiac monitoring via a reveal LINQ loop recorder (Medtronic). Furthermore, the investigators will assess; Change in cardiac index, right atrial size, RV size, fibrosis and stroke volume.
2. The investigators will assess the arrhythmic burden in relation to:

   * Change in 6 MWT
   * Hemodynamic changes with RHC
   * Hemodynamic changes in echocardiography
   * The number of patients progressing one FC (Modified NYHA class)
   * Changes in NT-proBNP.
   * Hospital admission for any reason
   * Death or transplantation
3. Monitor heart rate variability and address a comparison to known risk markers and CMR and echocardiography.

   The study specifically seeks to investigate following:
   * The incidence and type of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in PH by continuous long-term monitoring

In 2017, the prevalence of HHD worldwide was 217.9 per 100,000 people, an increase of 7.4% over 1990, which has brought huge financial burden and social and economic losses to the world. Therefore, HHD is a major public health challenge worldwide. In our previous studies, we found that miR-455-5p, a microRNA, could functioned as an inducer to promote cardiac hypertrophy. Because cardiac hypertrophy was a common phenomenon in patients with HHD, so it is interesting to clarify whether miR-455-5p could be employed as a marker to indicate the function and/or structure of heart in the development of HHD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to collect blood samples of hypertensive patients, as well as analysis the correlation between serum miR-455-5p level and cardiac function. The research could help doctors better predict the course of hypertensive heart disease and provide more effective treatments for different patients.","The purpose of this study was to collect blood samples of hypertensive patients, in order to clarify the correlation between serum miR-455-5p level and cardiac function.

EAT thickness is also associated with MetS and hypertension, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and insulin resistance.Studies have shown that moderate-intensity and high-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance exercise training reduce EAT. However, aerobic and resistance exercises may be found challenging and demanding by individuals and in most cases, high or moderate intensity exercise may be considered difficult. In a study conducted in physically inactive individuals, it was concluded that there was a significant increase in heart rate and BP following spinal stabilisation exercises performed 4 days a week for a total of 8 sessions for 2 weeks, but the increase in these cardiac parameters would tend to decrease following regular exercise. In the current literature, there is no study evaluating the effect of spinal stabilisation exercise on EAT thickness, exercise capacity and cardiovascular parameters in individuals with HT.

Barriers to access to healthcare services such as distance, time and cost can be overcome with technology. COVID-19 has accelerated the transition of many physiotherapy services to telerehabilitation.

Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder of the second half of pregnancy , which is characterized by increased vascular reactivity and peripheral resistance with pathological changes that are consistent with impaired blood flow to the affected vascular beds. Investigators will evaluate fetal and maternal vascular changes in normotensive and pre-eclamptic patients by Ultrasound and Doppler and their impact on prediction of pregnancy outcome.","Pre-eclampsia affects 2-8% of all pregnancies, although treatment is generally effective. However, 10-15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia(WHO, 2011). There is a considerable evidence that generalized endothelial dysfunction underlies the clinical manifestations of the disease (Oladipupo et al., 2014).

It has been demonstrated that peripheral nutritive blood flow is impaired in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and precedes onset of the disorder (Kenny et al., 2014).

The pathophysiological mechanism is characterized by a failure of the trophoblastic invasion of the spiral arteries which may be associated with an increased vascular resistance of the uterine artery and a decreased perfusion of placenta. (Al-Jameil et al ; 2014 ) Ultrasound of the brachial artery, and Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery and uterine artery are propaedeutic , non-invasive methods that contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of PE and Eclampsia (Takata et al., 2002 ).

Doppler assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for impaired placentation and its complications of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and perinatal death. Assessment of the fetal circulation is essential in the better understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide range of pathological pregnancies and their clinical management(Ghidini \& Vergani, 2012).",UNKNOWN,,2017-05-31,2021-12,2021-12,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,100,ESTIMATED

Potato, a potassium-rich food with high glycemic responses after consumption, exhibits unclear effects on hypertension. In this study, the investigators aimed to examine the association between potato consumption and hypertension risk among Chinese people.","Potato is considered as a superior crop due to its significant nutritive value and great production yield. China is the largest potato producer with a quarter of world production, followed by India, Russia, and USA. The potato production as well as consumption has enhanced in developing countries while continuously declined in developed countries during the last decade. The investigators therefore explored the prospective associations of consumption of total potatoes, sweet potatoes, stir-fried potatoes, and non stir-fried potatoes with the risk of hypertension in general people of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) cohort study from 1989 to 2011. A total of 11,763 participants (≥20 years old) who were free of hypertension at baseline were enrolled from CHNS Cohort study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the associations after adjusting for potential confounders. This study provides new evidence on the association of various potato consumption with the incidence of hypertension in China. As urbanization accelerates across the whole domain of China, the tendency of transition to Western-style diets and lifestyles appears continuously and steeply growing. More and more potatoes will be consumed as processed potato products including potatoes chips and French fries, which may be a potential risk factor of hypertension occurrence.",COMPLETED,,1989-01-01,2018-02-01,2011-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,11763,ACTUAL

NCT01899027,Rosuvastatin for Preventing Complications in Renal Ablation,Adjunctive Rosuvastatin Treatment for prEventing coMplIcationS In Renal Ablation,The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that twice overnight high-dose rosuvastatin loading before RNA followed by 3-month treatment with regular doses of rosuvastatin can reduce both the acute and late renal artery damage.,"Despite the availability and use of different classes of antihypertensive drugs, 5-30% of patients still show elevated blood pressure (EUROASPIRE III survey, 2011).

Recently, a novel catheter-based radiofrequency ablation technique has been developed allowing for renal nerve ablation (RNA). Currently, two different catheter-based systems are primarily used (Simplicityw catheter by Medtronic-Adrian and the EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter from St Jude Medical).

The RNA technique has been associated with a very low complication rate, but the development of a renal artery stenosis after RNA has been reported (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:2694-2695).

Although little is known about the vascular injury induced by the RNA procedure at the site of ablation, a recent study has reported for the first time the evidence at optical coherence tomography (OCT) of local vascular injury induced by the radiofrequency energy. Such local tissue damage, which is not apparent with angiography, is characterized by local and diffuse vasospasm, oedema formation, and endothelial injury with thrombus generation (Templin et al. Eur Heart J, 25 April 2012).

Experimental research have suggested that these abnormalities are only present in the acute phase immediately after RNA and seem to be the consequence of a transient phenomenon of inflammation (Clin Res Cardiol 2011;100:1095-1101), similarly to what occurs in the coronary arteries after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

In the last decade, multiple studies have convincingly shown that the pre-procedural administration of statins can significantly reduce the extent of cardiac damage at time of PCI (Patti et al, JACC 2011). No previous investigation, however, has assessed whether pre-procedural statin load play any protective role on renal arteries at time of RNA.

Study Population Patients with resistant arterial hypertension scheduled to undergo renal artery ablation

Randomization Patients will be randomized to receive two overnight high doses of Rosuvastatin (40 mg 12 h before RNA and another 10 mg dose 2 h before the procedure, N=50) or placebo (N=50).

Study design Patients will be randomized to receive two overnight high doses of Rosuvastatin (40 mg 12 h before RNA and another 10 mg 2 hours prior to the procedure, N=56) or placebo (N=56).

RNA will be performed with two different catheter-based systems (Simplicityw catheter by Medtronic-Adrian and the EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter from St Jude Medical).

All patients will have OCT utilizing the C7-XR imaging system (Light-Lab Imaging, Inc., Westford, USA) before and after renal denervation of both renal arteries.

After the procedure, patients included in the Rosuvastatin-group will be given rosuvastatin 10 mg/day for 3 months and patients included in the Placebo-group will receive placebo 1 pill/day for 3 months.

At end of the 3-month follow-up period, patients will undergo repeat OCT of both renal arteries.

Sample size If we expect an incidence of 50% for each of the three primary endpoints (vasospasm, oedema or thrombus) in the control arm and hypothesize a 50% risk reduction of such incidence in the rosuvastatin arm, a total sample size of 112 patients would provide 80% power to detect this difference with an alpha level of 0.05.

Duration of the trial: 1 year

Primary End-point

Optical coherence tomography evidence of vascular injury induced by the radiofrequency energy, as detected by the evidence of at least one of the following 3 abnormalities:

* Presence (vs. absence) of local and diffuse vasospasm (i.e. as defined by immediate loss of lumen area or lumen diameter in any part of renal artery)
* Presence (vs.r absence) of oedema formation (i.e. as defined as any significant endothelial-intimal notch detected on the luminal wall surface)
* Presence (vs. absence) of endothelial injury (i.e. disruptions of the superficial intimal lining defined as endothelial detachments or vessel dissections) with thrombus generation (i.e. as a protruding mass attached to the luminal surface with a diameter of 0.5 mm in at least three following cross-sections)

Secondary End-points

* Comparison of the extent of vascular injury between the two catheter-based systems used for the study (EnligHTNTM vs. Simplicityw)
* Comparison vs. baseline of 24-hour and 48-hour post-procedural changes in CRP, creatinine. eGFR (as expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2), urine albumin:creatinine ratio, and absolute values of NGAL (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin).

Expected findings According to a previous preliminary experience with optical coherence tomography (Templin et al. Eur Heart J, 25 April 2012), the expected frequency of vascular injury in statin-naïve patients is 42% for vasospasm, 96% for oedema, and 67% for thrombus.

We expect a reduction of at least 25% in the frequency of abnormalities with pre-treatment with rosuvastatin.",UNKNOWN,,2014-01,2017-12,2016-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,112,ESTIMATED

The complication of myocardial fibrosis should be avoided in hypertensive heart disease, because increasing ventricular stiffness caused by myocardial fibrosis leads to the development of diastolic dysfunction of the heart. Diastolic dysfunction in patients with prolonged hypertension is often associated with myocardial fibrosis in addition to muscular hypertrophy as a final feature of hypertensive heart disease. The high risk of developing maladaptive cardiac remodeling during hypertension, and failure of pharmacological treatments to limit or even reverse this progressive stiffening of the myocardium, has led to the study of effects of Pycnogenol, a bioflavonoid-rich pine bark extract, with pleiotropic actions on cardiovascular system. Pycnogenol prevents adverse hypertension-induced myocardial remodeling in mice, through modulation of gene expression and activity of enzyme matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, affecting myocardial collagen degradation rate. Despite the mounting evidence suggesting the anti-remodeling effect of Pycnogenol in animal models, the clinical efficacy of Pycnogenol in hypertension-induced diastolic dysfunction is unreported. This leads to our central hypothesis that Pycnogenol reverses the hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients. Therefore in this clinical investigation, we will investigate the effects of Pycnogenol in modifying hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis (by measuring the serum markers of myocardial fibrosis and collagen turnover) and diastolic dysfunction (by transthoracic echocardiogram). We expect to improve diastolic function and ameliorate myocardial fibrosis with the nutritional supplement Pycnogenol, by modulation of MMPs and TIMPs enzyme activities.",TERMINATED,Not able to recruit qualified patents,2009-07,2011-07,2011-07,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,9,ACTUAL

NCT05091827,Cardiovascular Risk in Infants Exposed to Pre-eclampsia in Utero,Assessment of the Cardiovascular Risk Profile of Infants Exposed to Pre-eclampsia in Utero,"An increasing number of scientific publications show that high blood pressure is being described in younger and younger children of African ancestry. It therefore makes sense to seek for the causes of this raised blood pressure in the in utero events. Recent studies have attributed and increased risk to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to the gestational environment. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the mother which may influence how the developing foetus interacts with the external environment later on in life. Indeed scientific literature suggests that the foeto-placental vascular endothelial dysfunction may cause epigenetic alteration in the intrauterine environment of the foetus which may be at the origin of chronic diseases in children, thus predisposing them to risk factors of CVD. However, very few studies in women of African ancestry have been carried out to investigate whether or not children born of pre-eclamptic mothers of African ancestry are at risk of developing CVDs. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular risk in children born to pre-eclampsic mothers in a rural South African population. A prospective case-control control design recruiting pre-eclamptic and normotensive pregnant women and their offspring subsequently will be used. CVD risk will be accessed in the pregnant women at 30 weeks of gestation and in the offspring at birth and then six weeks later. The difference in CVD risk between children born to these two groups of women will be assessed and the correlation between maternal and offspring risks for CVDs determined. It is expected that results obtained from this project will provide information on the cardiovascular effect of in utero exposure to PE in a population of African ancestry. This knowledge will advise policy on the management of women with pre-eclampsia with a view of preventing cardiovascular diseases in the offspring. Furthermore, the project will afford the opportunity for scientific research capacity building in students in Walter Sisulu University and foster collaboration between clinical and fundamental researchers.","Study design This will be a prospective case-control study involving babies born to pre-eclamptic (cases) pregnant women as the case and babies born to normotensive mothers (control). The mothers will be recruited at the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This is a tertiary hospital to which all specialist cases are referred from the peripheral hospitals. Even though the prevalence of PE in South Africa is just over 5% nationally, 18% of all obstetric cases consulted in the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha are PE cases (unpublished data). It will therefore not be a great challenge to recruit the desired number of PE patients over the study period.

Sample size calculation The study done by Amini et al, (2010) showed blood pressure (BP) differences between neonates from normotensive and pre-eclamptic mothers5. The difference in blood systolic BP (SBP) was very high (normotensive: 49.85±5.49 versus pre-eclamptic: 68.2±149). Because the SBP variance and standard deviation were very high in the pre-eclamptic group, we decided to rather use the diastolic blood pressure values (normotensive: 30.17±11.89 versus pre-eclamptic: 42.11±11.49) for sample size calculation. The software - R was used: alpha = 0.01, mean difference = 11.94 and standard = 0.05 respectively were used. The results showed that total sample size is 97 (48 cases and 49 controls). We make the assumption that not all participants would return for the follow-up. Thus we adjusted our sample size by 20% to compensate for possible loses to follow-up. Therefore the total sample will be 97 + (97x20/100) = 117 neonates. However the study will start with the recruitment of 117 pregnant women (58 pre-eclamptic women and 59 normotensive pregnant women who meet the selection criteria).

NCT04451876,"Social Media Use ,Online Health Information Seeking and Knowledge on Hypertension","Social Media Use ,Online Health Information Seeking and Knowledge on Hypertension Among Undergraduate Students of Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)","The percentage of hypertension among adults aged 18 is relatively high which is about 30% in Malaysia. Uncontrolled hypertension will increase the risk of diseases especially cardiovascular disease. However, adults still lack awareness about the importance of knowledge of hypertension. In between, online health information seeking and the use of social media to gather health information have been quite a norm among students. The wide use of this platform has been proven in various researches and studies.

This study will be conducted among the undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM to look at the various socio-demographic factors associated with their level of knowledge on hypertension. Therefore, this may lead to a need to plan awareness programs on hypertension and to increase the knowledge of hypertension among health science students in the future. A cross-sectional study design will be done for this study. All undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM will be selected through simple random sampling. Online questionnaires will be given via the selected student email platform.

However, there are limitations for this study where we only focus on the students of FMHS, UPM. Hence, the results of this study may be limited to them only. The causal relationship cannot be determined by this study design as well. The purpose of this study is to determine the social media use, online health information seeking practices with knowledge on hypertension among undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM, and its associated factors","BACKGROUND Hypertension is a medical condition that acts as an important public health problem worldwide. It contributes to the disease which is mostly seen in primary health care settings such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death if it is not diagnosed as soon as possible. The World Health Organization (WHO) significantly mentions that an estimation of 1.13 billion people worldwide from poor countries where the healthcare system is weak have been detected with hypertension. Hypertension also puts an enormous financial pressure towards individuals and medical services via utilizing limited resources . Hypertension is predisposed to multiple factors. Such factors vary from country to country and there is also a disparity between urban and rural areas of the same location.

In Malaysia, 30% of adults above 18 have hypertension. Based on another study, it was proven that adults with uncontrolled hypertensive portrayed a higher risk of CVD mortality when compared to normotensive adults. It was reported that there were 3550 of them all caused hypertensive death and based on that 1027 are caused by cardiovascular disease; 771 are caused by heart-specific diseases and 256 by a cerebrovascular specific disease. However, untreated hypertension was stated to be the high risk of all caused death.

Based on a study by Grad I. et al, global knowledge on hypertension among adults is relatively low which is almost 49.2%. Whereas for medium knowledge on hypertension has 38% and only reported that 13% has higher knowledge on hypertension

. Besides, adults also have insufficient knowledge on epidemiology, method of treatment, and avoidance of hypertension(6).In addition, a good understanding of hypertension has also been linked with enhanced compliance with medications and good control of blood pressure.

According to Loiselle (1995), health information behavior is basically defined as a self-regulatory technique used by patients to coordinate transactions between self-related and health-related settings with the goal of balancing instrumental benefits and informative subjective costs. The students use electronic health knowledge to take some essential health-related decisions and actions. Students reported using the health details gathered more as a guide for lifestyle changes (72.4%) and the rest is dealing with healthcare practitioners online about the change in medication and guide of lifestyle changes.

WHO states that many people, primarily in the developing world, have access to online medical information, engage in online groups, buy well-being goods and services.

From the other side, hospital reports are often linked up by health agencies. The search for online health information has been on the increase and the knowledge gained has diverse influences on the healthcare outcomes of human beings. Based on a study conducted on 4504 respondents about mobile health use and perception among Malaysians in Selangor, only 1 in 5 respondents reported using some health-related application or mobile health device. The analysis of the health details that Malaysia is pursuing is still limited. From the point of view of scientific research, not much study has been done on different problems that occurred in the sense of finding health knowledge.

One of the interventional strategies to the elimination of health inequalities is by utilizing social media as a popular way to get health information. Depending on the concepts of loyalty and mutuality, social media promotes the sharing of life-enhancing services, such as health-related knowledge and social ties. In fact, social media sites are activating feedback systems that result in an enhanced degree of self-efficacy, which is vital in sustaining healthier behaviors and adhering to treatment. It becomes a mixture of direct contact and mainstream media which is personalized and responsive. Social networking media, including Facebook, one of the social media networking platforms, has such connectivity features in their architecture. As of 2004, it has been extremely popular with more than 350 million users around the world.

Non-communicable diseases constitute a worldwide crisis that contributes to more than 36 million (63 %) of all mortality globally. Almost 29 million (80%) of such deaths arise in low-and middle-income nations. Increasing use of social media implies a strategy to achieve scalability or even overcome barriers that often impede public health measures. For example, a smartphone-based home glucose monitoring service has been implemented through which community health professionals have given clinical advice for diabetic patients through smartphones.

The social media use, health information seeking, and knowledge on hypertension in Malaysia are not well studied. It is beneficial to have an overview of the social media use, health information seeking and knowledge on hypertension among the students of Faculty of Medicine and Health Science (FMHS), UPM because they are individuals who will work in a healthcare setting in the near future.

In conclusion, knowledge of hypertension is relatively very important to reduce the prevalence of hypertension and to create more awareness among the public. Ways of getting knowledge and online health information like social media are important as it is becoming a popular form of information. This study will be conducted among the students in FMHS, UPM because of the variety of sociodemographic factors present that will be a platform to see the association between the factors and their level of knowledge on hypertension. Moreover, this may be a good start to plan an awareness program on Hypertension and also initiate programs to increase the knowledge of hypertension among the students.

STUDY OBJECTIVE General Objective To determine the social media use, online health information seeking and knowledge on hypertension among students in FMHS, UPM.

Specific Objective I. To determine the socio-demographic factors (age, gender, race, family income status, undergraduate course and year of study) of students of FMHS, UPM. II. To determine the social media use of students among FMHS, UPM. III. To determine the online health information-seeking behavior on hypertension among students of FMHS, UPM. IV. To determine the level of knowledge on hypertension among students of FMHS, UPM. V. To study the association of socio-demographic factors, social media use and online health information seeking on the knowledge of hypertension.

STUDY INSTRUMENTS Study instruments include a questionnaire adapted from a previously published questionnaire. The questionnaire to assess the social media use and health information seeking was adapted from a study about Health Information Seeking and Social Media Use on the Internet among people with Diabetes. The hypertension knowledge questionnaire was adapted from a tool developed to assess hypertension knowledge among urban patients. This questionnaire is prepared in English and is divided into four parts.",COMPLETED,,2020-08-17,2020-10-30,2020-08-24,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,286,ACTUAL
NCT03401476,Effect of Morphine on Dyspnea and 6-Minute Walk Distance in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,Effect of Morphine on Dyspnea and 6-Minute Walk Distance in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Despite advances in treatment and corresponding improvements in survival, patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain highly symptomatic. In one survey of 315 patients with PAH, sixty-eight percent had moderate or severe dyspnea on exertion and 40% had a profound and clinically significant deficit in quality of life. Palliative care is being increasingly investigated in life-limiting cardiovascular diseases to alleviate symptoms. In PAH, its implementation is frequently delayed until end-of-life. Opioids are a common palliative care intervention, however the efficacy and safety of opioids for symptom relief in PAH has not been evaluated.","There is biologic plausibility for opioids in the treatment of dyspnea in PAH. Opioids have widespread effects including venodilation, vasodilation, reducing sympathetic outflow, blunting hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses, and altering the central perception of dyspnea. Although the origins of dyspnea in PAH are incompletely understood and multifactorial, right ventricular dysfunction reduces exercise capacity and likely also plays a role in the development of dyspnea. Mechanoreceptors situated in the right atrium and right ventricle sense elevated pressures and via sympathetic afferents may lead to an augmentation of ventilatory response and hence dyspnea. Morphine may specifically antagonize this feedback loop by causing venodilation and blunting sympathetics. Morphine also reduces central chemosensitivity and perceptions of dyspnea. Therefore, the drug may antagonize both peripheral and central drivers of dyspnea in PAH.

Investigators will conduct a single-center feasibility study of morphine for treatment of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in PAH. Participants will complete two 6-minute walk tests (6MWT) within one week. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive morphine prior to either the first or second 6MWT. Symptoms and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) will be compared between the two tests.",UNKNOWN,,2017-05-08,2019-12-31,2018-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,TREATMENT,15,ESTIMATED

NCT04861727,Use of Technology to Optimize Hypertension Treatment in Elderly People in Primary Care,Use of Technology to Optimize Hypertension Treatment in Elderly People in Primary Care,"The control of blood pressure (BP) in the elderly is influenced by several factors, among them, the measurement methodology. The measurement of BP in the office is prone to failures, so the use of technology associated with blood pressure measurements at home is an alternative to minimize failures and contribute to the optimization of treatment. The objective of this study will be to evaluate the adequacy of the treatment of Systemic Arterial Hypertension (SAH) in primary care using Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (MRPA). Method: Randomized clinical trial with hypertensive patients, aged 60 years or over, attended at the Family Pharmacy service inserted in the primary care of the municipal health network. The subjects who accept to participate in the study will be randomized to the intervention / control groups. submitted to MRPA, will undergo analysis of the pharmacotherapy prescribed for the treatment of SAH, collection of clinical data, which together will support the assessment of the adequacy of the treatment of hypertension. When inadequacies in pharmacotherapy are identified, suggestions for changes will be forwarded to the prescriber / professional or assistant health team, weighted by the pharmacist in agreement with the patient and according to the guidelines of the Brazilian Guideline on Hypertension. The outcomes: changes in treatment and blood pressure control in the intervention and control groups will be evaluated.","The study will be carried out at a municipal public pharmacy. The subjects will be users of the Family Pharmacy, aged 60 years or over, who seek the service to remove the drugs prescribed for the treatment of Systemic Arterial Hypertension. In order to calculate the sample for this study, the incidence of patients with Hypertension System who need treatment adjustments (under- or over-treatment) will be considered. It is expected that in the intervention group, MRPA indicates that 30% of patients will need to change their pharmacotherapy and, in the control group, using the office measure, 10%. For a two-tailed test with 80% power, 5% sampling error and 95% confidence level, the sample will be 160 users in the intervention group and 160 in the control group. Considering the pandemic of COVID-19 and the risk of infection during care in health services, whether from patients or health professionals from the health care network, the Family Pharmacy already adopts the screening for respiratory symptoms that identify suspected infection by Sars-Cov-2.To minimize the impact of selection and information bias, the following procedure will be used to select individuals: during attendance at the windows, each trained attendant will invite patients with eligibility criteria, when they accept, they will be inserted in the service schedule. The selection for control group and intervention group will take place by drawing from the list of scheduled people, with 3 participants being drawn for the Intervention Group, totaling 160 participants in each group. Data collection will only occur after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF). The Control Group will be attended by Pharmacists and will have the data collected according to the standard collection instrument, will receive general guidance on blood pressure control and pharmacotherapy assessment. The Intervention Group, in addition to the control group procedures, will also perform the MRPA, the result of which will guide the pharmaceutical suggestions, when necessary, they also received a Letter of Referral to the Prescriber containing pharmaceutical suggestions for optimization of pharmacotherapy, considering the current clinical protocols. In the service, patients and companions will be instructed on preventive measures against Sars-coV-2 infection, in addition to performing hand hygiene with water and liquid soap or 70% alcohol gel. The office will undergo cleaning before and after use, as well as the material, in addition to adopting the time of 15 minutes between appointments, maintaining the ventilation of the room, following all the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Pharmaceutical evaluation is already a routine of the service. For the purposes of this research, the procedures will be added to standardized instruments and routines to guarantee methodological quality and answer the questions of this research. The Data Collection Form (Appendix I) will be used, which includes the collection of data related to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. In order to assess adherence, the Portuguese version of the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) will be used in two stages: during the initial evaluation, when the patient was included in the research and 45 days after the intervention.

The pharmaceutical suggestion procedure, for this research, is defined as forwarding a letter of suggestion to the prescriber, previously agreed with the patient, based on clinical evaluation, review of pharmacotherapy, adherence to treatment and result of the MRPA procedure. The definition of the conducts to be adopted will be based on the 8th Brazilian Guideline on Systemic Arterial Hypertension, and in a complementary way - as it is an elderly patient (60 years old or more) - by the Brazilian Consensus on Potential Medicines Inappropriate for the Elderly.

The data will be tabulated and analyzed using the SPPS® Statistic 25 software. The Kolmogorov-Sminorv test will be used to assess the data distribution. The paired T test will be used to assess the differences between BP measurements in the office and the MRPA mean. Continuous variables with normal distribution will be presented as means, standard deviations and Odds Ratio. Categorical variables will be presented as a proportion, using the Chi-square test. Values of p \<0.05 will be considered significant.

To compare the proportion of patients with controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure, before and after application of the intervention, the chi-square test (χ2) will be used.

PPAR-γ is a nuclear hormone receptor and functions as a regulator of lipid- and glucose metabolism. PPAR-γ ligands improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.

Angiotensin II receptor 1-blocking and PPAR-γ-activating properties of losartan metabolites in patients would markedly improve the pharmacological profile of losartan by combining anti-hypertensive and highly beneficial metabolic actions. We developed the following hypothesis:

NCT06214676,OCTA in Patients With Primary Open-angle Glaucoma,Detection of Microvascular Changes in Patients With Primary Open Angle Glaucoma by Using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography,Is to investigate retinal microvascular changes in primary open angle glaucoma patients using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive imaging technique developed to visualize vascular networks in the retina and choroid. It utilizes low-coherence interferometry to measure changes in backscattered signal to differentiate areas of blood flow from areas of static tissue.

OCTA provides both structural and functional (i.e. blood flow) information in tandem. The ""corresponding"" OCT b-scans can be co-registered with the simultaneous OCT angiograms so the operator is able to scroll through the OCT angiogram like a cube scan. As a result, the precise location of pathology can be viewed on the corresponding OCT b-scans. This makes OCTA a better tool when detecting the exact location of a retinal pathology.

Glaucoma is the first cause of irreversible blindness and represents approximately 15% of all causes of blindness . This makes it a real public health problem. In 2020, glaucoma affected about 80 million people worldwide, with nearly 75% of open-angle glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive, blinding, irreversible optic neuropathy characterized by damage to the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibers with subsequent visual field defects ,elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a crucial glaucoma risk factor that causes direct damage to RGCs and the optic nerve . Moreover, glaucomatous retinsl ganglion cells loss occurs as well in people with normal IOP, implying mechanisms behind pressure-mediated damage. RGCs death may be due to the reduced blood supply and microvasculature dysfunction may be essential in glaucoma pathogenesis .

One hypothesis is that POAG is categorized by impaired chemical endothelial signaling between both: a) the inner wall Schlemm's canal endothelial cells as well as endothelial cells located in the ciliary body and the posterior longitudinal muscle that helps to set outflow resistance and b) the ocular vascular endothelial cell and underlying luminal smooth muscle for vessels supplying the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This hypothesis could explain why POAG occurs across a spectrum of IOP but it does not consider the role systemic endothelial cell dysfunction may play in the disease.

The non-invasive technique of OCT angiography (OCTA) can image and quantify both large vessels and the microvasculature of the optic nerve head (ONH), retina and choroid layers . Using the OCTA technique, reduced vessel density (VD) was observed in the ONH, peripapillary area and macula, predominantly in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-04,2025-02,2025-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,30,ESTIMATED

NCT01526876,The Effect of Clevidipine on Intracranial Pressure and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CCP) in Brain Injured Patients,"Effect of Clevidipine on Intracranial Pressure, Cerebral Blood Flow, Brain Tissue Oxygenation and Brain Cellular Metabolism in Severely Hypertensive Patients With Acute Brain Injury","Patients with acute brain injury are at risk for complications such as increased pressure in the brain (intracranial pressure (ICP)), decreased blood flow, bleeding, and brain swelling (cerebral edema). Several studies have suggested that high blood pressure is associated with a worsening outcome possibly due to an increased rate of continued bleeding or rebleeding, as well as increased brain swelling (cerebral edema). High systemic (body) blood pressure (SBP) may also increase the risk of ongoing bleeding. Therefore lowering the blood pressure (BP) is critical, as continued bleeding occurs most frequently in patients with high BP.

Clevidipine Butyrate (Cleviprex) is a new medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute high blood pressure (hypertension). Cleviprex is given through an intravenous line (IV) and has the benefit of being faster acting and easier to control adjustments than other drugs used to treat high BP. Patients who have an acute brain injury and who have severe high BP may benefit from this faster acting medication.

For this study, eligible patients, 18 yrs of age or older, will have been admitted to the Neurocritical care unit within 24 hours after their brain injury, who have high systemic (body) SBP. The treating physicians will have already had multimodality brain monitoring placed for clinical management of the patient (standard care).

The investigators will use Cleviprex to lower their SBP and record brain pressure and brain blood flow measurements from the multimodality monitoring. Due to the severity of their brain injury most of the patients eligible for the study will be unable to provide consent. Informed consent will be sought from a surrogate (family member, spouse or close friend) according to Columbia University Medical Center guidelines.

Cleviprex is fast acting and effects are seen in about 90 seconds. The medication will be started at a low rate, and if the SBP still needs lowering, the dose increased every 90 seconds until the maximum FDA approved dose is reached. If the SBP is still high, another medication used to treat high blood pressure will be added (Cardene or labetolol).

Once the SBP is lowered and is stable, the Cleviprex will be continued for 6 hours. As part of standard care, patients have their blood pressure monitored continuously. After 6 hours the treating physician will make a determination to continue clinical management with cleviprex or another antihypertensive medication.","This is an open-label, single arm, single center study in patients with hypertension in the setting of an acute brain injury. Approximately 15 patients admitted to the Columbia University Neurocritical Care Unit with intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury who are hypertensive and have neuromonitoring probes placed in the course of standard clinical management will be enrolled over a 10-12 month period. Patients must be hypertensive (SBP \> 180mmHg), or have an elevated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) above 100 mm Hg and the decision has been made by the ICU team to initiate an infusion of clevidipine to maintain CPP within a target range of 70-90 mm Hg and SBP between 120-180mmHg.

Due to the decreased level of consciousness from their injury, the majority of patients will be unable to provide consent. Informed consent will be sought from a surrogate according to Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) guidelines (See section 8-Informed Consent Process).

Clevidipine infusion will be used to treat hypertension within the first 24 hours after injury. Multi-modality brain monitoring will have been placed as standard care.

Clevidipine will be infused at an initial rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 90 seconds and titrated to effect (CPP target range of 70-90 mm Hg) by either doubling or reducing the dose by 50% every 90 seconds (with dose ranging 0-32mg/h of continuous IV infusion).

At the end of 6 hours clevidipine treatment, the treating physician will make a determination to continue clinical management with clevidipine or change to another antihypertensive medication.

This increase is connected in part to a growing number of people who are overweight and do not eat right or exercise enough. In younger children though, high blood pressure is a common consequence of underlying diseases, such as renal diseases.

This study looked at a blood pressure medicine called TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) to see how it works in children who have hypertension. Azilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that converts into TAK-536 (azilsartan), a blood pressure lowering medicine that had not been tested in children.

To be eligible to take part in this study, children with a diagnosis of hypertension (primary or secondary) must have been between the ages of 1 year and 16 years old (up to their 17th birthday). Each child was given one dose of azilsartan medoxomil, followed by a number of blood tests and assessments within 24 hours after taking azilsartan medoxomil to see how the medication is working. Adults who do not have hypertension also took part in this study to provide comparison.

This study took place in 9 sites in the UK and USA. A total of 20 children with hypertension and 9 adults without hypertension participated in this study.

This study lasted about 43 days. This included a 28 day screening period, a 2 day treatment phase and a follow up period. Each participant taking part in this study may have been requested to remain in a hospital for one overnight stay during the course of the study.

Treatment time is from the start of surgery up to 24 hours.,"Endothelin-1 levels are increased during and after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and are associated with many deleterious consequences, including increased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), reduced myocardial contractility, and ultimately right ventricular failure. Right ventricular failure during weaning from CPB increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, especially in patients with elevated PAP prior to cardiac surgery. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been shown to decrease PVR and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and improve right ventricular function in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In animal models, ERAs have been shown to decrease the incidence of post-bypass pulmonary hypertensive crises.

NCT01008176,Restoring Sleep Homeostasis to Lower Blood Pressure,Restoring Sleep Homeostasis to Lower Blood Pressure: A Behavioral Prevention and Treatment Approach,"Cutting back on sleep duration has developed into a common, highly prevalent habit in the adult population, and may lead to a major health problem. Large epidemiological studies have demonstrated that short sleep duration is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The investigators' preliminary data on the effects of experimental sleep reduction have shown elevation of blood pressure (BP) and inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C reactive protein (CRP), suggesting that both may play an important role in linking sleep loss and CVD risk. With this background, the investigators hypothesize that restoring sleep homeostasis, i. e. getting adequate amounts of sleep, is an effective behavioral intervention in the treatment of elevated BP.

The investigators will test this hypothesis in subjects with BP above normal and with short habitual sleep duration, as verified by sleep logs and actigraphic recordings. Subjects will either undergo 6 weeks of mild sleep extension, in which 60 min of bedtime will be added to the habitual sleep duration, or subjects will maintain their habitual sleep duration for the following 6 weeks.

Regarding their first specific aim, the investigators expect that sleep extension across 6 weeks will lower BP, inflammatory (IL-6, CRP, cell adhesion molecules) and autonomic markers (catecholamines). In particular, the investigators expect that in subjects with mild BP elevation, i. e. with pre-hypertension, sleep extension leads to normalization of BP.

This study presents a very first approach in using sleep behavior components for the treatment of elevated BP. Therefore, the investigators' second specific aim will characterize the strength of associations between changes in sleep duration, BP, and inflammation, and they will explore factors that are predictive for these changes. In particular, adiposity, as measured by percent body fat, has frequently been shown to be related to short sleep duration and inflammatory processes, but the role of adiposity in modulating the physiological consequences of changes in sleep duration has never been addressed.

If the investigators' hypothesis is correct, sleep extension may be considered as an additional component in current lifestyle intervention programs in combating and preventing hypertension.",,COMPLETED,,2005-09,2012-06,2012-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,23,ACTUAL

Pulmonary hypertension associated with CDH is frequently resistant to conventional pulmonary vasodilator therapy including inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can lead to right ventricular overload and dysfunction. In patients with CDH, left ventricular dysfunction, either caused by right ventricular overload or a relative underdevelopment of the left ventricle, is associated with poor prognosis.

NCT04143620,Triple Procedure for Dense Cataractus Neovascular Glaucoma Patients,Triple Procedure for Dense Cataractus Neovascular Glaucoma Patients,"Background: One of the most difficult refractory glaucomas in treatment is the neovascular type and its association with dense cataract add to this difficulty. This study aimed to provide results of triple surgical treatment of such conditions.

Methods: A total of 12 eyes of 12 patients with dense cataractus NVG patients were included in this study. The patients mean age was 57.25 ± 5.9 years. The mean pre-operative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 47.25 ± 4.04 mmHg with maximum antiglaucoma therapy. The mean best corrected distant visual acuities (BCDVA) in log MAR was 2.13 ± 0.38. All the patients received intra-vitreal injection of 1.25 mg (0.05 ml) bevacizumab followed by phacoemulsification, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) including pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP), and assisted trabeculectomy with Mitomycin c (MMC). Mean IOP and BCDVA changes were the main outcome results of this study.","Introduction Ocular ischemia due to diabetic retinopathy (DR) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) are the most common causes that contribute to the development of neovascular glaucoma (NVG). Ischemic retina derived factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that can affect the anterior segment and initiates neovascularization in the iris (NVI), neovascularization in the angle (NVA). Aqueous outflow is obstructed when neovascular fibrous tissues block the trabecular meshwork and leads to synechial angle closure, thus NVG develops. Intraocular pressure (IOP) rise due to NVG lowers the ocular perfusion leading to further retinal ischemia, and this in turn induces more neovascularization. The management of NVG is very difficult thus; the conventional treatments such as antiglaucoma drugs, trabeculectomy, cyclophotocoagulation and cyclocryotherapy have poor success rates. It is very important to reduce the ischemic drive promptly for the treatment of NVG. Pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) is a mandatory and effective in resolving the ischemic condition and decreasing the vasoproliferative factors production.\[ This management is particularly difficult in eyes with dense cataract. However, it is possible to overcome this difficulty by doing phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) + PRP. Moreover, phacoemulsification combined with PPV enables us to apply PRP from the posterior pole to the ora serrata peripherally. It has been known that Mitomycin C (MMC) increase the success rate of trabeculectomy in patients with NVG. Therefore, in the current study, we performed Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection, phacoemulsification, PPV + PRP and trabeculectomy augmented with subconjunctival injection of MMC.

The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of this combined surgical procedure to alleviate retinal ischemia, reduce IOP, and improve visual acuity in dense cataractus NVG patients.

Subjects and Methods

Twelve eyes of 12 patients with NVG associated with dense cataract enough to obscure fundus visualization (7 males, 5 females) were included in the study in the period from July 2016 to August 2019 at Ophthalmology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University. The patient's age ranged from 47 to 66 years with a mean age of 57.25 ± 5.9 years. The underlying cause for NVG was diabetes mellitus (DM) in 8 eyes (75%) and CRVO in 4 eyes (33.33%). Vitreous hemorrhage was present in half (50%) of the patients. The study was approved by the Local Ethical Review Committee and adhered to the tents of Declaration of Helsinki as well as all patients singed a written consent after discussion of the potential benefits and risks of this triple surgical procedures.

Preoperative examinations: Routine ophthalmological examinations were done after history taking including, age, sex, laterality, etiology of NVG and number of used anti-glaucoma drugs. The ocular examination includes estimation of visual acuity, IOP measurement with Goldman applanation tonometer, slit lamp examination of anterior segment, gonioscopy examination of angle of anterior chamber, biometry and ultrasonography. The demographic data were registered as in (Table 1).

Surgical procedures . In brief: - All procedures were done under peribulbar anesthesia with mild systemic sedation. IVB injection of 1.25 mg (0.05 ml) was given 2-6 days before surgery using a 27-gauge needle at the inferotemporal quadrant at 3.5-4.0 mm posterior to the limbus. Preoperative IV mannitol was given to all cases to lower IOP before surgery beside the full anti-glaucoma drugs including: topical Dorzolamide-Timolol combination, Brimonidine tartrate and oral Acetazolamide (250 mg) three times a day. Subconjunctival injection of MMC in a dose of 0.04mg/ml was done, and a period of 4 minutes was left before Conjunctival opening.

Fornix based Conjunctival incision was performed and a rectangular scleral flap of 3x4 mm was dissected. Separate temporal clear corneal incision phacoemulsification was done with intrabagal one-piece hydrophobic IOL implantation. Then, incision was closed with 10/0 nylon suture. This was followed by three ports 25-G PPV including core vitrectomy, injection of triamcinolone acetonide, induction of PVD, shaving of vitreous base, and dealing with any epiretinal membranes. PRP using diode endo-laser was done up to the far periphery (2000-3000 shots, duration 200 ms; power 400 mw). Fluid-air exchange was then performed and 20% SF6 was injected leaving 10 cc of gas to adjust pressure at the end of surgery. Then, the upper sclerotomies were sutured by vicryl 7/0 and the infusion cannula was left in place connected to the syringe of 20% SF6. Then, Healon was injected into the anterior chamber to maintain depth of anterior chamber and trabeculectomy by Kelly punch and peripheral iridectomy were done. Scleral flap was sutured by two 10/0 nylon sutures at the corners followed by watertight Conjunctival wound closure. More SF6 was injected to adjust IOP and the infusion cannula was removed, and its site was sutured with vicryl 7/0 suture. At the end of surgery, fluid was injected into the AC to test for filtration of bleb and to make sure that the conjunctiva was closed watertight. At last, triamcinolone acetonide subtenon injection was given to all eyes.

Post-operative management: The patients were prescribed prednisolone 1% (predfort, Alcon Co.) eye drops QID and tapered through 8 weeks, cyclopentolate 0.5 % TID, moxifloxacin 0.3 mg (Vigamox, Alcon Co.) eye drops QID for 2 weeks and ointment of tobramycin and dexamethasone at night for 4 weeks. Scheduled follow up visits were advised next postoperative day, one week, two weeks, monthly for three months, and then each three months for 2 years.

All patients underwent full ophthalmologic examination including BCDVA, IOP, gonioscopy, slit lamp examination, and dilated fundus examination. Antiglaucoma medications were prescribed if IOP was more than 21 mmHg. Baseline results and that of 1, 3 and 6 months, 1 and 2 years were included in the statistical analysis. This study main outcome measures were the mean BCDVA (log MAR), the mean IOP and the incidence of complications. Successful surgery was considered when the target IOP =21 mmHg was achieved without serious complications such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage, choroidal effusion, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, phthisis bulbi, or persistent hypotony (IOP \<5 mmHg). Complete success was considered when IOP of 6 -21 mmHg was achieved without any anti-glaucoma drugs, and qualified success when this target IOP was achieved with and without the use of anti-glaucoma drugs. Failure was defined as IOP \>21 mmHg despite the use of maximum tolerated medications, hypotony, or the need for another glaucoma surgery.

Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Changes in the mean BCDVA and the mean IOP were compared for each follow up visit with baseline using paired t test and graphs construction done by using Graph Pad Prism 5 program. P value \< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",COMPLETED,,2016-07-01,2019-08-31,2019-08-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,12,ACTUAL
NCT06436820,ICP & Outflow Study,The Relationship Between Intracranial Pressure and Aqueous Outflow in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension,"This study aims to investigate the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and aqueous outflow (the flow of the eye's internal fluid out of the eye), in patients with increased intracranial pressure (idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)).

Through observing changes in aqueous outflow facility in patients scheduled for lumbar Puncture (LP) as part of their routine care the objectives we aim to answer include:

* Investigating the effect of lumbar puncture induced reduction in ICP on patients with known or suspected IIH, compared to control patients, who will be receiving LP for reasons not pertaining to high pressure.
* Comparing pre lumbar puncture aqueous outflow facility between patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and control patients.

Outside of the standard care provided for these patients as part of their scheduled lumbar puncture, they will have measurements of their eye taken before and after their lumbar puncture.","This study aims to investigate the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and aqueous outflow (the flow of the eye's internal fluid out of the eye), in patients with increased intracranial pressure (idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)).

The effect of lowering intracranial pressure on aqueous outflow will be examined by taking additional measurements before and after a procedure called a lumbar puncture (LP). These measurements include a scan to measure the dimensions of the eye, intraocular pressure reading, and a non-invasive technique to measure aqueous outflow (electronic Schiotz tonography) which is used regularly in the eye research unit at St Thomas' Hospital.

Study participants will already be scheduled for a lumbar puncture as they have known or suspected IIH, and LP is routinely used to investigate this. Additionally, control participants having LP for reasons not pertaining to a condition that may elevate intracranial pressure will also be included. Study participants will finish their involvement following the second aqueous outflow reading, after their LP.

A lumbar puncture procedure directly measures the intracranial pressure, but also reduces the pressure in the process. If aqueous outflow is measured before and after lumbar puncture, it will provide more information about whether the change in intracranial pressure affects the intraocular pressure due to a change in the rate of fluid flowing out of the eye. If a relationship between intracranial pressure and aqueous outflow is found to be present, it may offer an alternative non-invasive measurement for intracranial pressure. Additionally, this study would highlight an avenue of investigation into dysregulation of intraocular pressure in conditions such as glaucoma. Similarly, negative findings would help inform ongoing discussions and controversies in the literature regarding relationships between intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-06,2025-11,2025-11,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,66,ESTIMATED

NCT00194974,Treatment Targets for Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy,Treatment Targets for Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy,"This project is a clinical study of women with high blood pressure who become pregnant. Preeclampsia is a syndrome developing at the end of a pregnancy characterized by an abrupt rise in blood pressure (BP), blood clotting and kidney dysfunction, and may result in premature delivery, infant death, and maternal bleeding, kidney failure and stroke. The goal is to determine whether lowering blood pressure to a normal pressure of 120/80 is associated with a lower incidence of preeclampsia. Women who are completely healthy have a 5% chance of developing preeclampsia, however women with preexisting high blood pressure have a 25% chance of this complication. Several studies, including our own suggest that higher blood pressure early in pregnancy (\<20 weeks) is associated with an even higher risk of preeclampsia. Currently we, the researchers at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, do not know how to treat women with high blood pressure and/or kidney disease during pregnancy. Keeping the BP in the normal range may be beneficial to the mother. On the other hand, we are not sure if the blood pressure lowering or the medications may or may not have adverse effects for the baby. Different trials to answer this question have been performed with no clear conclusions. Because of these uncertainties, we propose to compare two different strategies for treating women with high BP who become pregnant. We will treat half the women with BP medications to normalize BP (120-130/80 mm Hg) (experimental group) and the other half with the goal of keeping the BP slightly higher (140-150/90-100 mm Hg)(standard therapy group). We will determine which approach results in healthier pregnancies, and lower incidence of preeclampsia. Reducing the incidence of preeclampsia would be of significant benefit to both mothers and babies.","Methods:

This is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of conducting a larger, multi center randomized control trial. Fifty women with chronic hypertension who are pregnant and are seen in the first trimester of pregnancy will be recruited from the offices of obstetricians at New York Presbyterian Hospital.

Recruitment:

First trimester (up to 13 6/7th weeks)

Stratified by:

* Parity (primiparous vs. multiparous delivering a fetus \>20 weeks gestation)
* Severity of hypertension (\>150/95) as determined on screening antepartum visit

Inclusion Criteria:

1. Pregnant patients will be evaluated for recruitment to 13 6/7 weeks gestation.
2. Age 18-50
3. Patients will be included for consideration to enter this trial if office blood pressure is \>140/90 mm Hg: systolic \>140 mm Hg, diastolic \>90 mm Hg or both. The average of 3 readings taken a minimum of 5 minutes apart will be recorded as the baseline blood pressure.
4. Patients will also be included for consideration to enter this trial if they have known longstanding hypertension diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \>90 within 2 years of index pregnancy and/or are on antihypertensive medication, regardless of in-office blood pressure if seen in their first trimester.

Exclusion Criteria:

Significant target organ damage; at the patient's initial antepartum visit, routine serum creatinine and urine dipstick for protein are performed by the attending obstetrician. If the patient has been hypertensive by history for over 5 years, a screening electrocardiogram will be performed. These will be reviewed for results precluding participation in the trial.

1. Known renal disease creatinine \> 1.2 mg/dl
2. Proteinuria \>500 mg/day at baseline
3. Left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiography (ECG) criteria.
4. History of the following: chronic illness requiring immunosuppression, as well as secondary causes of hypertension: pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, coarctation of aorta, renal artery stenosis not revascularized.

NB: the presence of the above conditions would make it more likely that a clinician would treat blood pressure during pregnancy. Therefore, the patient may be randomized and treatment begun as per protocol prior to complete evaluation of presence of above conditions; if exclusion criteria are subsequently identified the patient would then be excluded and treated according to individual physicians standard of practice.

Enrollment:

Patients will undergo initial baseline evaluation. History and physical will be performed. Weight, height and blood pressure will be recorded.

Eligible patients will sign informed consent. Each patient will have a data sheet for the purpose of recording study results.

Randomization:

Patients will be randomized to one of two blood pressure targets:

120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg

Randomization will occur by blocked randomization in blocks of 6. Randomization is stratified for parity (nulliparous vs. multiparous) and severe vs. non-severe hypertension. There are therefore 4 potential groups:

1. Nulliparous + non-severe hypertension
2. Multiparous + non-severe hypertension
3. Nulliparous + severe hypertension
4. Multiparous + severe hypertension

There are 54 envelopes for each group (allowing for the theoretic possibility that all patients may fall into one group) and envelopes are numbered and will be opened sequentially to allocate patients during the randomization process.

Treatment:

Patients with no prior history of hypertension will be treated as per the protocol described below.

Patients with a known history of hypertension will still be randomized to the appropriate group according to parity and blood pressure in clinic, but will be asked to stop their antihypertensive medication for a wash out period.

The patient will then return to clinic three to seven days later off medication to have a repeat blood pressure measurement. If they own a home blood pressure monitor and this has been calibrated to office equipment, they may take their blood pressure at home.

They will be then be treated as per their randomization group i.e. to a blood pressure of 120-130/80-85 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90-100 mm Hg as per the protocol below.

The patient will be given a diary to record obstetric data and blood pressure data. Duplicate records will be kept by the patient and physician.

Weight, blood pressure, pulse, presence or absence of edema and urinary protein will be recorded at each visit.

Medication Protocol:

Treatment is to commence immediately after randomization unless the patient is undergoing a washout period described above.

Some patients will initially require no medication as BP's may be below the treatment threshold, depending on their treatment group.

Treatment will be with methyldopa, labetolol, long acting nifedipine, hydralazine or clonidine.

Scheduled Visits:

Patients will be followed every two to four weeks until delivery. Medication will be titrated to achieve the desired blood pressure targets. Patients will not be billed for these visits.

The achievement of target blood pressure will be assessed by an average of three blood pressure measurements obtained at every six weeks visits: weeks 20, 26, 32 and 38.

At the 20 week visit, routine blood work will be drawn to evaluate uric acid and plasma renin activity as validation of the prediction algorithm.

Home Blood Pressure Monitoring:

If patients own a home blood pressure monitor, they will be asked to bring it into clinic for calibration. They will be given a blood pressure diary to record home blood pressure monitoring or BP measurements done in another clinic or pharmacy.

Duration of Treatment:

The treatment goals of 120-130/80 mm Hg vs. 140-150/90 mm Hg will be applied from the time of randomization until delivery. Postpartum, clinicians will choose their own blood pressure goals as per JNC-7 guidelines.

Assessment of Outcomes:

For the pilot trial, maternal blood pressure is the primary outcome. This will be measured at weeks 20, 26, 32, 36 using a standardized method: after 15 minutes of rest, blood pressure will be measured with the woman seated, arm supported at heart level, bladder of cuff encircling \>80% of arm circumference and phase V Korotkoff used for diastolic reading. Blood pressure will be recorded three times, five minutes apart, and the mean of these values will allow assessment of BP control in the study.

Secondary outcomes:

1. The incidence of superimposed preeclampsia in chronically hypertensive women. Diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia will be made by the following criteria:

   * Worsening hypertension after 20 weeks
   * AND proteinuria \>.3g/day on 24 hour collection when there was previously none OR doubling of proteinuria, in those positive at baseline
   * AND/OR the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis on blood smear, liver transaminase levels \> 2 x normal, low platelets \<100/mm3).
2. Gestational age
3. Birth weight \< 10th centile for gestational age

Then the optimal noninvasive indicator for identify PH was determined and its critical point was obtained according to the Youden Index. Based on this, we investigate the proportion, risk factors and prognosis of PH in idiopathic bronchiectasis patients in another large-scale population.","Between April 2011 and December 2019, the data of idiopathic bronchiectasis patients were analyzed to determine the optimal noninvasive tool to identify PH. Based on the patients who received RHC examination, Spearman correlation was used to assess the correlation between mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) measured by RHC and other noninvasive indicators (estimated PASP assessed by echocardiography, main pulmonary artery (MPA) diameter and MPA/ ascending aorta (AA) ratio on chest HRCT scan), in order to screening out the optimal indicator to identify PH.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of non-curable blindness globally. Patients with glaucoma will get a gradual narrowing of the visual fields caused by compression at the optic nerve head due to increased intraocular pressure. Thus the main preventive strategy is to reduce intraocular pressure, initially by eye drops and/or laser treatment but in some patients surgery is warranted. The surgical procedure (trabeculectomy) most widely performed worldwide creates a path from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival space and thereby lowers the IOP by producing a more efficient drainage of the aqueous humour. Surgical success depends upon controlling post-operative inflammation to ensure a functional drainage. The purpose of this blinded, randomized study is to investigate which anti-inflammatory treatment provides better long-term control of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) following glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy) by comparing topical NSAIDs to topical steroids. Additionally, we want to explore the mechanisms behind the pathophysiology of glaucoma by evaluating retinal and optic nerve head perfusion before and after IOP lowering surgery. The primary outcome is the intraocular pressure 12 months after surgery measured by applanation tonometry.

MAIN HYPOTHESIS:

* NSAIDs and steroids are equally effective in assuring long-term filtering function and controlling IOP after trabeculectomy but may be associated with different risk profiles and bleb morphology
* Patients with lower post-operative IOP demonstrate less progression of visual field loss
* Trabeculectomy lowers IOP and provides better microcirculation in and oxygenation of inner retinal layers (i.e. ganglion cell layer) and the optic nerve head",,UNKNOWN,,2019-08-01,2023-07,2022-06-15,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,PREVENTION,70,ACTUAL

Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1.) standard of care (SOC) treatment or 2.) SOC plus a 6 week CR program.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic auto-immune disease characterized by inflammation and structural damage in synovial joints, but also has extra-articular involvements such as the cardiovascular system. RA patients have higher mortality rates than the general population, and approximately half of premature deaths are due to cardiovascular comorbidities. Traditional risk factors, especially hypertension (HTN), play a key role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

In chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA, autoimmunity is a cause of HTN as well as a result of physical damage to the vascular wall. Mild blood pressure elevation caused by specific HTN triggers such as salt retention, angiotensin-II or genetic susceptibility leads to neoantigen release through tissue damage. These neoantigens are recognized by antigen-presenting cells and lead to the differentiation of CD4+ naïve-T lymphocytes into Th1 and Th17 cells. IL-17 and IFN-γ expression causes local inflammation in the vascular wall, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness. Thus, HTN causes an increase in CVD risk through a common pathogenesis mechanism with RA.

European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations emphasize that rheumatologists should be responsible for CVD risk management in RA. However, both RA and HTN treatment is generally administered pharmacologically without focusing on CVD risk. Patients may be recommended regular exercise and lifestyle changes according to EULAR recommendation guide for CVD risk management. One possible intervention that could be used to decrease CVD risk caused by both diseases is cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program in which regular exercise is one of the main components. But RA patients, especially those with cardiovascular comorbidities, are rarely referred to the CR program.

This study will help to clarify the effects of the CR program added to the pharmacological treatment of these patients on cardiovascular mortality risk (Framingham risk score and QRISK-3 score), blood pressure (24-Hour holter monitoring), disease activity (DAS28-CRP), aerobic capacity (VO2max), quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey) and psychological state (Beck depression inventory).",RECRUITING,,2022-12-15,2024-06-15,2024-04-15,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,40,ESTIMATED

NCT00005748,Stress Reduction and Prevention of Hypertension in Blacks,,To examine the role of Transcendental Meditation in stress reduction and prevention of hypertension in Blacks.,"BACKGROUND:

African Americans suffer from disproportionate rates of hypertension and related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due, at least in part, to excessive socioenvironmental and psychosocial stress. Furthermore, despite the substantial individual and population risk burden associated with high normal blood pressure (BP) in African Americans, there had been no controlled studies to evaluate stress reduction approaches in the primary prevention of hypertension targeted to this high risk group. Therefore, recent (mid 1990s) NIH and NIMH policy committees called for a new research focus on primary prevention of hypertension targeted to high risk populations-notably African Americans with high normal BP. In previous randomized controlled trials by the investigator, hypertension and psychosocial stress were significantly reduced in low SES African Americans who practiced stress reduction with the Transcendental Mediation (TM) program compared to relaxation or health education controls. In the most recent long-term trial, African Americans with borderline hypertension showed BP reductions that would be associated with a 17 percent decrease in prevalence of hypertension, a 15 percent reduction in stroke, and a 6 percent reduction in CHD in the population. These BP reductions compared favorably to decreases shown with sodium restriction and weight loss programs in other prevention trials. Also, pilot data from two clinical trials indicated that TM was associated with significantly lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in African Americans and in Caucasians with high BP over a 5-year and 15-year period, respectively.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A randomized controlled trial of stress reduction for the primary prevention of hypertension was conducted in African Americans with high normal BP. African American males and females (N-352, aged 21-75 years) with high normal BP (SBP 130-139 and/or DBP 85-89 mm Hg) were recruited from the African American Family Heart Health Plan at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, which housed the nation's largest registry of African Americans with known CVD risk factors. After baseline assessment, participants were randomized to either the TM program or to a matched health education control intervention. The primary outcome was change in clinic BP over a 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes in ambulatory BP, hypertensive events, psychosocial stress and health behaviors. Also, a model of the pathways through which components of stressful experience affect high BP in African Americans was tested.

This study is described as a clinical trial. The summary statement states that it is not an NIH Phase III clinical trial.

Vision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. The modern goals of glaucoma management are to avoid glaucomatous damage, nerve damage, preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients with minimal side effects.

Although intraocular pressure is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. Intraocular pressure can be lowered with medication, usually eye drops. There are several different classes of medications to treat glaucoma with several different medications in each class. In order to prevent blindness from glaucoma, it is critical that patients take their glaucoma eye drops accurately and faithfully for the rest of their lives. Poor compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for vision loss in glaucoma patients. In addition, coordination involved in placing an eye drop in the eye is considerably more difficult and unpleasant to patients than many other therapies.

The study also aims to test this training course among non-physician graders in Vietnam,"Background:

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of diabetes will increase by 51% from 463 million in 2019 to 743 million in 2045 among adults between the ages of 20-79 years. This increase is projected to be 15% in Europe, 33% in North America, 74% in South East Asia and 143% in Africa from 2019 to 2045. About 3 in 5 participants who have diabetes in Africa remain undiagnosed. Whereas the total diabetes related health expenditure is 494 billion USD in high income countries, and 264 billion USD in middle income countries, low income countries expend only 1 billion USD. Therefore, diabetes is a huge problem worldwide especially in low income countries.

Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes which leads to blindness if left untreated. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness especially among the working group when vision is very important for daily living. Diabetic retinopathy is identified in a third of diabetic patients.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) however can be treated effectively but early detection and timely referrals are essential for successful outcomes. Early diagnosis, timely referrals and access to treatment through a comprehensive and systematic surveillance of the diabetic population has been shown to be clinically effective and cost effective. The United Kingdom (UK) has a national population based diabetic retinopathy screening programme which has been very successful. These screening programmes are non-existent or inadequately developed in many resource constrained settings. A study was recently concluded in Vietnam in which non-physician graders were trained to screen for diabetic retinopathy among the population of diabetic patients. The study also assessed the accuracy of DR grading among medical graders versus non-physician graders in Vietnam.

The aim of this current study is to develop and test a low cost opportunistic glaucoma screening model during diabetic retinopathy screening using the same non physician graders currently used in the recently concluded diabetic retinopathy (DR) study.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic optic nerve changes and functional visual field defects which in part is related to a raised intraocular pressure (IOP). The disease is characterized by typical pattern of damage to the optic nerve, loss of retinal ganglion cells, and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Glaucoma can be divided into two main types based on the morphology of the anterior chamber angle: there is the open angle and the angle closure glaucoma. These two types of glaucoma have different risk factors, different natural histories and different management. There are other forms of classification which include primary and secondary glaucomas depending on the etiology of the glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. An estimated 60.5 million persons were said to be affected by glaucoma in 2010. Glaucoma is a huge problem worldwide especially in developing countries. The disease however can be managed with medical, laser, and surgical forms of treatment. Reduction of intraocular pressure by 30-50% from baseline usually stops progression of the disease.

It has been reported that the increasing life expectancy especially of Asians and Africans may lead to an increase in the prevalence of glaucoma by 74% from 2013 to 2040. It is projected that the prevalence of glaucoma will increase from 64.3 million to 111.8 million in 2040, and that glaucoma will disproportionately affect people residing in Africa and Asia.

Glaucoma often progresses unnoticed by the patient until central visual acuity is affected, therefore early detection of the disease is important before symptoms develop. The rate of undiagnosed disease however is quite high in developing countries with a large proportion not being aware of the disease. It is estimated that about 95% are not aware of their glaucoma in developing countries while 50% are unaware of the disease in developed countries. Early detection of glaucoma requires some form of screening. Screening of any disease is a form of secondary prevention and the goal is often to prevent undesired outcomes. In the context of glaucoma, screening helps to diagnose it in the asymptomatic stage so that treatment can be started earlier to slow down or prevent progression of the disease to blindness. In a recent study on the burden of undetected untreated glaucoma in the United States, it was reported that the odds of having undiagnosed glaucoma was highest among blacks with a 4.4 times greater odds compared with Caucasians. This disparity was attributed to uneven access to health care by blacks. One way to alleviate this is to conduct population based screening for glaucoma. But this has not been found to be cost effective in developed countries.

In a very recent study published in the Lancet Global Health, however, population screening was reported to be cost effective in China. In a study on the cost effectiveness of community screening for glaucoma in rural India, it was reported that community screening would prevent 2,190 person years blindness over a 10 year period. It was concluded that community population screening may be cost effective if targeted at 40-69 years' age group and if implemented in urban areas. A study in China recently demonstrated using a decision analytic Markov model that population screening for both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) was cost effective in both rural and urban China.

It is possible that screening of two major blinding eye diseases (glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy) using the same facilities is likely to be more cost effective. Opportunistic glaucoma screening can be more cost effective especially when it is piggy bagged into another screening programme. Diabetic retinopathy screening has been ongoing with the use of optic nerve photos. It is possible to train the same non- physician graders who are currently screening for diabetic retinopathy to also screen for glaucoma using the same facilities and images.

The use of non-physician graders to conduct screening in low-resource settings is particularly important as these are the group of health workers who have been trained to screen for diabetes. In addition, it reduces the burden on scarce, highly-trained health care providers in developing countries.

Study Aims:

* To develop a training course for screening glaucoma using fundus images obtained during diabetic retinopathy screening by non-physician graders.
* To test this training course among non-physician graders in Vietnam

Main research question Can trained non-physician graders accurately screen for glaucoma during diabetic retinopathy screening?

Methods

Study design: This is an uncontrolled interventional experimental before and after study in which a minimum of 42 non-physician graders shall be trained to screen for glaucoma using optic nerve photos obtained for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in Vietnam.

The study flow will be as follows:

* Non-physician graders are consented, enrolled and undergo testing on the standard image set at baseline
* The non-physician graders complete the training course. There are questions at the end of each module of the course and participants must pass the revision questions. Those failing to pass any aspects of the revision questions must review those parts of the course.
* Non-physician graders will undergo a post course test on the standard image set.

Their performance will be compared to baseline and also to that of ophthalmologists who are taking part in the DR grading programme, but who have not taken the optic nerve grading course

• Non-physician graders will undergo a post course test on the standard image set.

Their performance will be compared to baseline and also to that of ophthalmologists who are taking part in the DR grading programme, but who have not taken the optic nerve grading course

Standard Image training set and Test Set:

These will each consist of about 50 normal optic nerve images of people without glaucoma and about 50 images of people with glaucoma, obtained from the on-going ORBIS CAFÉ DR screening programme (in which the graders are working), population-based eye studies in the UK (NICOLA) and the standard Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy Evaluation (GONE) set of images. (https://gone-project.com/newgone/)

Training and evaluating competencies:

Training shall be done online, using the Cyber-sight website of Orbis, The course has been created specifically for the study by the investigators, modified from materials used to teach physicians on the World Glaucoma Association and GONE websites and training courses for ophthalmology residents. A minimum threshold of 70% accuracy on a previously-designed test set will be considered as adequate competency. Participants who score less than 70% on the test will have a teacher led training course after which the participants will repeat the test again.

Recruitment:

Vietnam non-physician and ophthalmologist DR image graders: These persons are already trained to screen and grade diabetic retinopathy and will be recruited by asking them about their willingness to take part in the study. Informed consent will be obtained, and participants will be allowed to participate voluntarily .and if they told that if they choose not to participate in the study, their jobs will not be affected in anyway. A minimum of 42 non-physician and 12 ophthalmologist graders shall be included in the study

Planned statistical analysis of results:

Statistical Sample Size \& Methods: The minimum sample size of 42 participants was calculated using the paired sample size formula for quantitative outcome data with confidence level of 95% and statistical power of 80%. Using the statistics from the Glaucoma Optic Neuropathy Evaluation study (GONE), we assumed that the mean baseline score would be the same as the 5th percentile score on the GONE evaluation course which is 29%.

At the end of the course, we assumed that the mean score would be the same as the 45th -50th percentile score on the GONE evaluation course which is 60%. Briefly the GONE online course was designed to evaluate participant's skills in evaluating the optic nerve head for glaucoma. It was started in 2015 and as of October 2021, there had been 45,619 attempts by 11,287 individuals. However, when only first attempts and those who had completed at least 80% of the course were considered, this number reduced to 3666 participants. This course consists of 15 disc images in all.

Sensitivity and specificity (with 95% confidence Intervals (CI's)), positive and negative predictive values, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa statistic comparing non-physician and ophthalmologist graders in Vietnam with the grades on the standard image sets shall be performed. The performance of non-physician graders after training will be compared to that before training, and also to that of ophthalmologists who have not taken the optic nerve course but are working as DR graders in the CAFÉ programme, with the main outcome for comparison being the area under the receiver-operator curve.

Data Protection issues Participants from whom optic nerve images were obtained shall not be formally enrolled into this study. Only their de-identified optic nerve images will be used in this study and analysis of images shall be done in a de-identified fashion. Although optic nerve images are considered personal data, all images are fully anonymized and de-identified. Blanket permission for research use of images was obtained in the NICOLA, HANDAN and the GONE studies. These studies have full ethical approvals and obtained consent from participants to use the images in future studies.

All electronic copies of data shall be stored on password-protected computers with written log books and password protected access to buildings. All paper copies of data will be locked in a specific filing cabinets in QUB. All optic nerve photos will be anonymized, completely de-identified and kept in a safe, password-protected server at QUB. All data produced from this study shall be completely anonymized.",COMPLETED,,2021-11-22,2022-04-30,2022-03-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,SCREENING,42,ACTUAL
NCT06739057,Pediatric Ventricle Function Assessment Study,Pediatric Ventricle Function Assessment Study,"This study aims to develop a deep learning-based framework for right ventricular (RV) segmentation, prediction of RV fractional area change (FAC), and identification of pediatric RV dysfunction. The AI model was designed to distinguish between normal pediatric hearts, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). To improve diagnostic accuracy, the investigators extended the analysis beyond the A4C view by integrating data from both A4C and PSAX views. Additionally, the framework was applied to predict left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF), further showcasing its versatility and clinical utility.","Heart defects are a leading cause of birth defect-associated illness and mortality worldwide, affecting approximately 1% of live births globally. Among these, about one-quarter1 present with critical heart defects requiring early intervention to improve survival and outcomes.Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a prevalent form of heart disease in pediatric patients, often arising from conditions such as prematurity, post-surgical effects of congenital heart disease, functioning as the systemic ventricle, and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. These patients face significant risks, including RV failure, decreased quality of life, potential need for transplantation, and increased mortality. Accurate assessment of RV function is crucial but challenging due to the RV's complex geometry.

Unlike left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, RV dysfunction primarily results from pressure and volume overloads and has unique pathophysiological characteristics. While LV dysfunction mechanisms are well-studied, less is known about RV, and much of its clinical management is adapted from LV-focused research. The RV, with its thinner and more adaptable walls, remodels efficiently but often tolerate changes for extended periods before failure. Furthermore, RV dysfunction frequently leads to LV dysfunction due to strong interventricular interactions. These differences, along with the RV's irregular shape and orientation, complicate imaging and assessment, requiring advanced imaging techniques, often involving multiple modalities.

Precise evaluation of RV size and function is essential for diagnosing, managing, and predicting outcomes in pediatric cardiac conditions. Echocardiography, as a non-invasive and accessible tool, is the first-line imaging technique for monitoring RV function). However, traditional RV functional measures face limitations in pediatric populations due to significant variability in RV morphology. Among systolic parameters, fractional area change (FAC) has demonstrated stronger correlations with disease severity in advanced heart failure patients and a closer relationship with RV ejection fraction as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), suggesting its reliability in assessing pediatric RV function. An FAC \<35% is considered abnormal by the guideline. Accurate FAC assessment can guide timely interventions, improve prognosis, and enhance long-term outcomes by enabling better monitoring of RV function over time.

Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) includes a wide range of structural abnormalities and conditions that affect the heart's development before birth, with examples such as Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and Pulmonary hypertension(PH). The RV plays a crucial role in TOF diagnosis because its outflow tract obstruction and hypertrophy are primary features of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension increases the afterload (pressure) on the right ventricle, leading to RV structural and functional changes. These changes are typically not seen in the LV unless there is severe biventricular involvement or secondary effects.

Echocardiography is a non-invasive, widely accessible, and essential first-line tool for routine follow-up of various pediatric cardiac conditions affecting the right ventricle (RV). However, assessing RV function in pediatric heart disease remains challenging due to significant variability in RV morphology and physiology. The apical four-chamber (A4C) view is a cornerstone for right ventricular (RV) function assessment due to its ability to evaluate RV size, shape, and systolic function comprehensively. The parasternal short-axis (PSAX) view is often used as a supplementary echocardiographic view alongside the A4C view for assessing right ventricular (RV) function. Advances in AI-driven echocardiography, particularly deep learning, hold promise for enhancing cardiac function assessment. Recent innovations, like EchoNet-Dynamic, have shown the utility of video-based deep learning algorithms for adult LV segmentation and ejection fraction estimation. Building on this progress, the investigators developed EchoNet-Peds , an AI model for pediatric echocardiography that automates LV segmentation and ejection fraction calculations. Beside left ventricle segmentation methods, other deep learning applications include automated quantification of left ventricular structure and function, as well as novel methods for estimating intraventricular hemodynamic parameters on a beat-to-beat basis . However, most deep learning studies focus on LV assessment, with comparatively fewer models dedicated to the RV, mainly addressing segmentation tasks. While some recent advancements have emerged, such as a model estimating RV ejection fraction from echocardiographic images in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients , significant gaps remain in applying AI to pediatric RV functional assessment.

This study aims to develop a deep learning-based framework for right ventricular (RV) segmentation, prediction of RV fractional area change (FAC), and identification of pediatric RV dysfunction. The AI model was designed to distinguish between normal pediatric hearts, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).

All participants will be provided with a ""smart bottle"" to house their glaucoma medications. The smart bottle records the date and time that the bottle is opened. For participants in the intervention arm only, a reminder function will be activated. The proportion or prescribed doses taken according to the monitor will be compared for the two groups.","The purpose if this study is to improve glaucoma medication adherence in Veterans with medically-treated glaucoma. The study design is a single-site randomized controlled trial. Specific Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of an intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among Veterans at 6-month follow up.

Hypothesis 1: Veterans randomized to the intervention will have a greater proportion of prescribed glaucoma medication doses taken as measured by the electronic medication monitor in the 6 months following the intervention compared to Veterans randomized to the control arm.

The primary outcome for hypothesis 1A is the proportion of prescribed doses taken according to the electronic monitor. Participants in both arms will receive the electronic monitor or ""smart bottle,"" which wirelessly transmits the date and time of opening of the smart bottle to the study team. From these medication events, the proportion of prescribed doses will be derived, defined as the ratio of the number of times the smart bottle was opened to the required number of doses prescribed according to the medical record over the period of time that the bottle is in use. For example, if a participant is advised to take his or her glaucoma drop twice a day for the 180 days that the bottle is in use and the smart bottle reveals 135 openings over the same time period, the proportion of prescribed doses taken is 37.5%.

Specific Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of the intervention on intensification of glaucoma therapy among Veterans at 12-month follow-up.

Hypothesis 2: The proportion of Veterans in the intervention arm that are prescribed more intensive glaucoma therapy, defined as addition of adjuvant glaucoma medication or recommendation for laser or glaucoma surgery will be less than the proportion of Veterans in the control arm who are prescribed more intensive glaucoma therapy in the 12 months following the intervention.

Baseline data collection will include cataloging the current glaucoma medication regimen prescribed to the participant. Chart abstractions will be performed at 12 months following the baseline visit and intensification of glaucoma therapy will be defined as either 1) the addition of another glaucoma medication to the baseline regimen, 2) recommendation for glaucoma laser treatment, or 3) recommendation for glaucoma surgery in the 12 months following the baseline visit . The investigators will collect these data at 12 months because the Metrics study suggested that 55% of participants in the control arm will have intensification of therapy within one year.

Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness and budget and workflow impacts of the intervention compared to usual care.

Hypothesis 3: The intervention will be cost-effectiveness for the following ratios: 1) cost per percentage improvement in medication adherence; 2) cost per blindness averted; and 3) cost per quality-adjusted-life years saved.

A direct measurement approach will be used to estimate per-patient intervention and control arm costs. Glaucoma-related health care utilization costs will be derived from VA administrative datasets. The cost estimates will be combined with observed improvement in medication adherence and reduction in escalation in therapy to estimate the first two incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Simulation using Markov modeling will be used to estimate the incremental cost per blindness averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Cost estimates and labor time data collected will be combined with glaucoma prevalence rates among Veterans to estimate overall budget and workload impacts to the VA healthcare system.",COMPLETED,,2017-08-09,2021-03-01,2019-08-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,200,ACTUAL

This by obtaining a blood sample from the PAH patients undergoing right heart cathetrization as well as obtaining the endothelial cells from the balloon tipped catheters and extracting the EBV virus to detect its presence.

IgG, IgM and PCR for EBV tests will be done.","About Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pathophysiological disorder that may involve multiple clinical conditions combined with a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of more than 20 mmHg at rest (Humbert, M.et al., 2022).

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition characterized by vascular proliferation, leading to increased vascular resistance and right heart dysfunction. PAH may be idiopathic (Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension IPAH; previously known as primary pulmonary hypertension, PPH) or associated with other conditions or exposures, including connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, portal hypertension, and anorexigenic drug ingestion (Humbert, M.et al., 2022).

About Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus Chronic Active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is usually defined as a chronic illness lasting at least 6 months, an increased EBV level in either the tissue or the blood, and lack of evidence of a known underlying immunodeficiency. It may be associated with Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, and extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (Kimura et al., 2017).

CAEBV is characterized by an unusual pattern of anti-EBV antibodies and may be associated with cardiovascular abnormalities (Hashimoto et al., 2011).

Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is based on clinical symptoms and serological markers, including the following: immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA), heterophile antibodies, and IgG antibodies to the EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1)(Klutts JS. Et al., 2009).

Elevated levels of EBV DNA in the blood are more specific for CAEBV than elevated levels of EBV antibodies (Kimura H. et al., 2017).

Role of EBV in PAH The relationships between EBV and autoimmune diseases are complex and involve several mechanisms. A proposed scenario was the interrelation between genetic predisposition and EBV infection, a cross-reaction between self antigens and EBV viral proteins, the development of autoantibodies (anti-Sm or anti-Ro antibodies in SLE, anti-CCP antibodies in RA), an epitope-spreading process that can lead to the development of additional non-cross-reactive autoepitopes, and finally the clinical manifestations (Poole BD et al.,2006).

EBV has multiple impacts on host immunity and can adapt to its environment. For instance, EBV produces an IL-10-like cytokine, it can modulate IL-6 release, it induces the production of TNF-a by infected B cells, and it can inhibit apoptosis of infected B cells by the production of a Bcl-2 homolog. All these biological properties of EBV are relevant to, and can contribute to, the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders (Toussirot É et al.,2008).

The pathophysiology of the development of PAH in CAEBV is unclear. It may be related to lymphocytic infiltration and the resultant damage to the pulmonary vascular endothelium caused by EBV infection or may occur secondary to the vascular damage caused by inflammatory reactions induced by EBV infection (Gotoh K. et al., 2008).

Another is EBV-induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines resulting in inflammatory change (Fujiwara M. et al., 2003).",COMPLETED,,2023-05-01,2024-04-01,2024-03-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,78,ACTUAL
NCT00580957,The Autonomic Nervous System and the Metabolic Syndrome,The Autonomic Nervous System and the Metabolic Syndrome,"The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the role of the autonomic nervous system in the insulin resistant state associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity results from an accumulation of excessive fat deposit due to increase caloric intake or decrease energy expenditure, this condition is usually associated with diseases such as hypertension or diabetes, a cluster known as the metabolic syndrome. The first step in the development of the metabolic syndrome is a resistance to the action of insulin. The mechanism underlying insulin resistance in obesity is still unknown, however some investigators have proposed that the autonomic nervous system, particularly the increase sympathetic activation in obesity may play an important role. We have extensive experience studying the role of the autonomic nervous system in the cardiovascular alterations associated with obesity by producing complete autonomic withdrawal with a drug named trimethaphan. We propose to use the same approach to study the role of the autonomic nervous system in the development of insulin resistance in obesity.","The purpose of this study is to look at the role of the autonomic nervous system, an involuntary nervous system that controls your blood pressure, in insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin is a substance that helps your body use the sugar in the food that you eat. Some people's tissues stop reacting in a normal way to insulin, a condition known as insulin resistance. A person with insulin resistance can have other health problems, such as obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. These problems together are called the metabolic syndrome. We think that the autonomic or involuntary nervous system controls the way your body responds to insulin. This system is changed in obese people, and we think that it may cause the insulin resistance. We plan to study this with two drugs -trimethaphan and L-NMMA. Neither of these drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they will be used for research purposes only.

NCT04958057,Social Risks-Focused Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Preeclampsia (SAIL),Social Risks-Focused Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Preeclampsia in AA Women,"Preeclampsia is a disease of pregnancy and first few weeks after birth. It is diagnosed as new onset of high blood pressure and injury to organs such as kidneys, liver, and brain. Preeclampsia is growing at a rapid rate - rate that exceeds diabetes and heart disease. Over half a million lives lost each year to preeclampsia. Women with a history of preeclampsia have 3-4 times the risk of high blood pressure. They also have double the risk for heart disease and stroke. Racial and ethnic disparities are present in preeclampsia. Black women are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia. They are also at much higher risk of dying from preeclampsia than other women. The reasons behind such disparities are unclear. What may explain these differences are social determinants of health. The contribution of social determinants to differences in preeclampsia is well recognized. However, a major gap in research remains strategies that address these factors. Our study will test a lifestyle intervention incorporating social risk factors to reduce the risk of preeclampsia.","Preeclampsia is a significant global health problem affecting over 10 million pregnancies each year. Preeclampsia disproportionately burdens ethnic minority women, especially African American women when compared to non-Hispanic white women. Once diagnosed with preeclampsia, African women are 3 times more likely to die of preeclampsia compared to their white counterparts. Evidence supports contribution of social risk factors towards racial and ethnic disparities seen with preeclampsia. However, currently, there are few trials that examine efficacy of social risks-focused lifestyle interventions on reduction of preeclampsia and its complications. This proposal is designed to address this crucial gap by testing feasibility (Aim 1), acceptability (Aim 1) and efficacy (Aim 2) of a social risks-focused lifestyle intervention to reduce preeclampsia in pregnant inner-city African American women. The intervention will be delivered via a randomized control trial design (N=100), with 6 monthly group sessions conducted in the second and third trimesters. The overall hypothesis is that the intervention will be feasible and acceptable, and that women randomized to the intervention group will have lower blood pressure and lower rates of preeclampsia compared with women receiving routine prenatal care.",RECRUITING,,2022-03-28,2024-12-31,2024-11-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,100,ESTIMATED

NCT06726057,Implementing a Multi-component Hypertension Control Strategy in Rural Pakistan,A Multi-component Intervention for Controlling Hypertension in the Adult Rural Population of Pakistan: a Protocol for a Hybrid Type III Implementation-effectiveness Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"This is a research about cardiovascular disease risk reduction: a comprehensive package for the reduction of risk in Sindh, Pakistan. The research is being conducted by the Aga Khan University and is funded by the National Institute of Health and Care Research UK.

Hypertension is a major public health concern globally. It is a significant risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature death. In Pakistan, the prevalence of hypertension, including those on medication, is high. However, there are also high rates of undertreatment and underdiagnosis of hypertension in Pakistan. Addressing the prevention and control of CVD requires a multi-faceted approach that targets diverse populations across different settings. In some populations, we have interventions that have been proven effective but have not been implemented for example in rural communities. In Pakistan, prior community-based trial regarding multi-component hypertension intervention has proven to be effective in reducing blood pressure. However, the findings of this work have not translated to change in practice on the ground suggesting the need for implementation research to examine the best ways to implement this intervention in the real world. Hence, in this study researchers aim to assess the impact of this evidence-based intervention when implemented at scale in rural communities.

Participants will be asked to participate in a research study designed to improve their blood pressure control. This study enrols participants aged 35 years and above. As part of this study, they will undergo:

* blood pressure measurements at regular intervals by lady health workers
* home health education sessions conducted by lady health workers
* participants may be referred to a nearby health facility/qualified medical practitioners for management of high blood pressure
* baseline survey at the start of the study having questions about participants' medical history, risk factors for cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure and bodily measurements including weight, height and waist circumference
* follow-up surveys every 6 months for 2 years. The survey questions will comprise of medical history, risk factors for cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure; and bodily measurements including weight, height and waist circumference
* blood and urine samples for testing at baseline survey and during endline survey

POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORT

There are no risks involved as a result of participants' participation in this study except for their time. Since they will be followed up for 2 years, any new information developed during the study that may affect their willingness to continue participation will be communicated to them. Participants may feel a little discomfort at the site of the needle prick when drawing a blood sample.

POSSIBLE BENEFITS

Participants will be able to know about their risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. They'll be referred to a qualified medical practitioner for the management of your high blood pressure. Also, the results of their blood and urine tests will be shared with participants that will help them know about their health.

The Blood Pressure Lowering Strategies to Eliminate Hypertension Disparities (BLESSED) cluster randomized trial aims to test the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of a community health worker (CHW)-led multifaceted intervention compared to enhanced usual care for hypertension control in Black communities. In the BLESSED trial, the investigators plan to recruit 1,176 adults with hypertension (approximately 28 per church) from 42 predominantly Black churches in the Greater New Orleans area. The multifaceted intervention will last for 18 months, followed by a post-intervention follow-up visit at 24 months. The BLESSED trial aims to generate evidence regarding the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of this CHW-led church-based multifaceted intervention in eliminating hypertension disparities in the United States (US) general population.","Louisiana residents, especially African Americans, bear a disproportionately high burden of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the Blood Pressure Lowering Strategies to Eliminate Hypertension Disparities (BLESSED) cluster randomized trial, the investigators will compare the impact of two implementation strategies - a CHW-led multifaceted strategy and a group-based education strategy - for delivering interventions recommended by the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension clinical guidelines on implementation and clinical effectiveness outcomes in predominantly Black community members over 18 months. The BLESSED study utilizes an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design to: (1). test the effectiveness of a CHW-led church-based multifaceted implementation strategy for reducing estimated CVD risk over 18 months among African American church community members at high risk for CVD, and (2). assess the implementation outcomes (acceptability, adaptation, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetrance, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability) simultaneously. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework has guided the development and evaluation of the multifaceted implementation strategy, which includes CHW-led health coaching on lifestyle changes and medication adherence; healthcare delivery in community; church-based exercise and weight loss programs; self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP); and provider education and engagement. The CHW-led church-based intervention will provide strong social support and tackle multiple social determinants of CVD disparities. The primary clinical effectiveness outcome is the difference in mean change of systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 18 months between intervention and control groups.

NCT02822222,Safety Study of RMJH-111b to Treat Essential Hypertension,"A Phase 1/2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of RMJH-111b in Adult Subjects With Essential Hypertension","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of RMJH-111b, including how well it is tolerated, and the effect of RMJH-111b on blood pressure in subjects with hypertension. The study also measured the amount of magnesium in the blood and urine before and after RMJH-111b administration to evaluate what the body does to RMJH-111b (pharmacokinetics).","This was a phase 1/2, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and tolerability of RMJH-111b in adult subjects with essential hypertension. Assessments of pharmacokinetics and efficacy were secondary objectives.

RMJ Holdings LLC (doing business as RMJH Rx) is developing RMJH-111b (magnesium citrate, tribasic anhydrous) soft gelatin capsules for the treatment of essential hypertension. The rationale for developing RMJH-111b for essential hypertension is based on reported calcium channel blocker and vasodilator effects of magnesium cation (Mg++). Given this hypothesized mechanism of action, RMJH-111b may not be effective for subjects with other causes or forms of hypertension, and thus the diagnosis of essential hypertension was a key inclusion criterion for this trial.

In order to avoid confounding the results of the trial, subjects who were already taking anti-hypertensive medications to manage their hypertension were taken off of those medications and underwent a 7-day washout period. Subjects that met the specified blood pressure criteria after the washout \[systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 150 and ≤ 200 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 95 and ≤ 115 mmHg\] received placebo orally twice a day (bid) for a 3-day run-in period (Days 1-3). Subjects that were recently diagnosed or previously diagnosed and off treatment for \> 1 week before starting the study and who met the blood pressure criteria proceeded directly to the 3-day run-in period (i.e., without the 7-day washout period). During the 3-day run-in period, the subjects remained in the clinical research unit (CRU) on a low salt (2.5 g/24 hours) diet.

Subjects that remained eligible after the run-in period were randomized to receive either 440 mg of RMJH-111b or placebo orally bid (i.e., total daily dose of 880 and 0 mg elemental magnesium, respectively) for a 7-day treatment period (Days 4-10). A total of 21 subjects randomized 15:6 to RMJH-111b or placebo was planned. Subjects were randomized on either June 10th or 23rd of 2016. Based on the screen failure rate of the 1st cohort, the number of subjects needed for the 2nd cohort was projected. The actual number of subjects eligible for randomization at the end of the run-in period in the 2nd cohort exceeded the projection by 1 and all eligible subjects were randomized. Thus, the actual number of subjects randomized was 22, with 16 subjects in the RMJH-111b group and 6 subjects in the placebo group (i.e., 16:6 rather than 15:6). Subjects remained in the CRU on a low salt (2.5 g/24 hours) diet for the entire 7-day treatment period and through the 24-hour post treatment assessments (Day 11).

Subjects returned to the clinic 8 days (±3 days) after the last dose of Study Drug (active or placebo) for their Final Study Visit.

Protocol-specified reasons for discontinuing a subject from the study included, but were not limited to: 1) subject's blood pressure was too elevated for them to safely continue in the study (subjects who experienced SBP \>200 mmHg or DBP \>115 mmHg had to have these measurements repeated approximately 1 hour later, and if the SBP or DBP remained elevated, the subject was to be removed from the study and treated accordingly), 2) subject experienced a sharp drop in blood pressure (SBP \< 110 mmHg or DBP \< 60 mmHg); 3) subject's patellar reflex (knee jerk) disappeared, and 4) subject's total serum magnesium levels increased to ≥ 5 mg/dL (twice the upper limit of normal). As a conservative measure for this first trial of RMJH-111b, the criterion regarding drop in blood pressure did not require any associated clinical symptoms. For the pivotal trial, RMJH Rx will incorporate orthostatic hypotension monitoring and refine the discontinuation criterion regarding drop in blood pressure to allow for continued Study Drug treatment in the absence of clinical symptoms, so as to avoid unnecessarily removing a subject that is experiencing therapeutic benefit.

All measurements used for the safety assessments in this study are widely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. Further, they included standard parameters used in the evaluation of drugs with the potential for anti-hypertensive and magnesium toxicity effects.

Because blood pressure varies at daytime compared to nighttime, mean daytime (8 AM to 4 PM), nighttime (10 PM to 6 AM), and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) parameters were used to assess the efficacy effects of RMJH-111b on blood pressure in this trial. While 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is considered as a more precise method for the evaluation of drug effects on blood pressure than clinic visit (seated) blood pressures, this trial also included efficacy evaluations of seated SBP and DBP parameters for informational purposes and in particular to facilitate the design of the larger pivotal trial where ABPM monitoring will not be practical.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of magnesium is complicated by pre-existing endogenous levels of magnesium, other ingested sources of magnesium (daily diet and supplements; supplements with total daily dose of magnesium ≤ 150 mg were allowed in this study), and the tight regulation of magnesium in the body (magnesium homeostasis) with relatively high levels of magnesium in bones and soft tissues compared to approximately 1% in the blood. Thus, the total serum magnesium exposure was anticipated to be minimally effected with RMJH-111b intake, but evidence of urinary magnesium excretion coupled with maintained total serum magnesium exposure was expected to provide an indication of intake rather than magnesium wasting.",COMPLETED,,2016-06-10,2016-07-07,2016-07-07,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,22,ACTUAL

NCT00001622,Study of the Response of Human Small Blood Vessels,Study of the Relation Between In Vivo and In Vitro Response of Human Small Vessels,"A layer of cells called the endothelium line the walls of blood vessels. These cells produce substances that control the tone of blood vessels and thus control blood flow through the vessel. One of the substances produced involved in the control of blood vessel function is nitric oxide. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the relaxation of blood vessels.

Researchers have been interested in the function of the endothelium in patients with high blood pressure (essential hypertension) and patients with high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia).

After conducting studies on the endothelium and nitric oxide, researchers have found that the endothelium is indeed functioning abnormally in patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In addition, researchers have determined that the dysfunction is a result of abnormalities in the nitric oxide (NO) system.

In this study researchers plan to investigate the relationship between blood vessel responses in real-life settings versus laboratory settings in normal volunteers, patients with high blood pressure, and patients with high cholesterol.","Over the last ten years, we have been interested in the investigation of endothelial function in patients with essential hypertension and patients with hypercholesterolemia. We have performed intra-arterial infusion of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent drugs into the brachial artery with noninvasive measurement of the response of the forearm vasculature by means of strain gauge plethysmography. Those studies have allowed us to: a) demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with hypercholesterolemia; and b) identify an abnormality in the endothelium-derived nitric oxide system that is responsible for endothelial dysfunction in these patients. Further studies to more precisely determine the intracellular processes that mediate this abnormality in endothelial function in these patients are limited by the inherent shortcomings of the in vivo technique. An alternative possibility is the study of human small vessels in vitro; however, the relationship between in vivo and in vitro vascular responses to endothelium-dependent and -independent agonists has not been established. In the present study, we propose to investigate this relationship in normal volunteers, patients with essential hypertension, and patients with hypercholesterolemia.",COMPLETED,,1997-03,2001-03,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,,,,TREATMENT,87,

NCT03258125,miRNA-452 in Patients With Preeclampsia and Its Correlation With MMP-9,Expression of miRNA-452 in Patients With Early Onset Preeclampsia and Its Correlation With MMP-9,Preeclampsia is a pregnancy related disease characterized by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women. PE is one of the most challenging diseases in obstetrics worldwide that affects 2-8 % of pregnancies causing both morbidity and mortality of both mother and fetus.,"The etiology and pathophysiology of preeclampsia are still unclear but the impaired invasive ability of the trophoblast cells of the placenta and vascular endothelial cell damage are the main two factors. The invasiveness of trophoblast cells depends on the production of proteases, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs are a family of 24 zinc dependent endopeptidases capable of degrading extra cellular matrix components. MMP-9 plays an important role in placental invasion and implantation.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small (19-24 nucleotides in length), single-stranded, non-protein-coding RNAs, which suppress translation or promote the degradation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thus play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and even development of cancer.

The role of miRNA in preeclampsia pathogenesis has been investigated in a number of studies. One of the target areas of the miRNAs that forms a link with preeclampsia pathogenesis is the dysregulation of trophoblast differentiation, proliferation, and invasion; this occurs during early pregnancy and leads to the development of preeclampsia; a range of miRNAs have been confirmed to play pivotal roles in these processes by targeting a number of different genes.

MiR-452 is a newly discovered cancer related type of miRNA that was shown to be involved in invasion process where it was upregulated in certain types of cancer such as blad¬der cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma and was found to be significantly decreased in other types of cancer such as non-small cell lung cancer , glioma, prostate cancer and Gastric cell cancer.

Based on these previous studies which demonstrate the effect of miR-452 in invasion process of cancer cells either by stimulation or inhibition and that preeclampsia is a disease of impaired placental invasion in which MMP-9 play an important role, we will investigate the placental tissues expression changes of miR-452 which is not studied yet in early onset preeclampsia patients compared to control and try to find a possible mechanism by which it act on placental invasion by measuring expression level of MMP-9 and making correlation between them. The results of this study will provide experimental and theo¬retical basis for clinical prediction, prevention and treatment of preeclampsia.",COMPLETED,,2019-01-01,2020-06-01,2020-04-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,50,ACTUAL

In this rospective comparative study, we are aimed to evaluate the correlation between EUS-PPG measured in supine position (EUS-suPPG), and EUS-PPG measured in left lateral decubitus position (EUS-lePPG).","The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) remains the gold standard for assessing portal hypertension, yet its clinical application faces several limitations. First, HVPG has restricted diagnostic scope, being unable to accurately evaluate prehepatic or presinusoidal portal hypertension. Second, the measurement process exposes both patients and physicians to radiation and involves complex techniques that preclude routine implementation in many hospitals. Finally, as HVPG indirectly estimates portal pressure through wedged hepatic venous pressure, its accuracy may be compromised by multiple factors including intrahepatic venous shunting, catheter insertion depth, excessive sedation or patient agitation during the procedure, and incomplete balloon occlusion of hepatic venous flow.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided portal pressure gradient (EUS-PPG) measurement effectively addresses these limitations of HVPG. Current clinical studies on EUS-PPG have predominantly been conducted in the supine position. However, this position significantly increases the technical difficulty of endoscopic ultrasonography and complicates the simultaneous performance of endoscopic selective varices devascularization (EUS-ESVD) under single anesthesia. The consistency of EUS-PPG measurements between left lateral decubitus and supine positions requires further investigation.

This prospective comparative study enrolls hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by esophagogastric varices. Prior to endoscopic treatment, we perform EUS-guided puncture of both the portal vein and hepatic vein using a 25G needle. Pressure transducers measure the portal venous pressure (PVP) and hepatic venous pressure (HVP), with their differential defined as EUS-PPG. Measurements obtained in supine position are designated EUS-suPPG, while those in left lateral decubitus position are termed EUS-lePPG. Statistical analysis will evaluate the correlation between EUS-suPPG and EUS-lePPG values, with postoperative monitoring for complications including infection and hemorrhage.",RECRUITING,,2025-05-20,2026-06-30,2026-05-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,40,ESTIMATED

Narrowed arteries in the brain can cause stroke. Animal studies show that nitrite injections improve blood flow and that injections over long periods of time prevent damage to the arteries in the brain; however, there is no information on the effects of prolonged nitrite infusion in humans. This study will establish the safe dose and side effects of nitrite infusion in humans.

Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened for high or low blood pressure, aspirin use, pregnancy, and blood levels of nitrite and methemoglobin (a substance that temporarily and slightly lowers the oxygen carried in the red blood cells). Pregnant women are excluded from the study.

Participants are admitted to the Clinical Center for 16 1/4 days, the first 2 days in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Upon admission they provide a medical history, have physical and cardiovascular examinations, and blood tests. For the infusion procedure, a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the wrist or the crease of the elbow to measure blood pressure, and catheters are placed in a vein in each arm for administering the nitrite and withdrawing blood samples.

In the morning of day 1, after initial blood pressure and heart rate measurements are taken and a blood sample is drawn, a saline (salt water) infusion is started. Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then every hour for 6 hours, then every 2 hours for 12 hours. Blood samples are collected every 4 hours for 24 hours.

If the pressure continues to remain stable, monitoring continues every 8 hours for the rest of the study. Blood is drawn periodically from the catheter to determine the amount of nitrite and methemoglobin in the body, with decreasing frequency from several times during the first hour of the infusion to every 24 hours.

It also has been shown to open blood-brain barrier facilitating transfer of chemotherapeutic agents, dilate constricted pulmonary arteries, and inhibit apoptosis, as well as modulate angiogenesis. Until recently, all these biological effects were attributed to the regional synthesis of nitric oxide by the endothelium and its local influence of vascular tone. However, ""NO bioactivity"" may be transported in blood and have biological effects at a distance from the site of entry into the circulation. These effects of NO are mediated by intravascular NO-stores. Candidates are protein and heme-bound NO species (RXNO) in plasma or erythrocytes and the oxidative NO-metabolite nitrite. Cumulating evidence suggests that nitrite may serve as a major intravascular storage pool for NO. Recent studies have shown that (1) regional, intra-arterial infusion of nitrite elicits a downstream vasodilator response in humans and (2) intravenous long-lasting administration prevents development of delayed cerebral vasospasm in a primate model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). These studies suggest a potential new therapeutic approach to many diseases. Despite extensive data documenting the pharmacokinetics and safety of the bolus and short intravascular infusions of nitrite, there are no human data evaluating safety and toxicity of prolonged delivery of nitrite, which would be required for treatment of vascular diseases.

OBJECTIVES

This study has the following objectives: (1) to determine the safety and (2) toxicity of a 48-hour and 14-day intravenous infusion of nitrite. The study should also help to elucidate the mechanism(s) through which nitrite ions contribute to vasodilation.

STUDY POPULATION

The study population will include sixteen 48-hour infusion healthy volunteers (out of 40 screened volunteers) of both genders, age 21-60, who will have a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite (the source of the drug will be determined by a CRADA).

DESIGN

This is a Phase I toxicity study of intermediate (48-hour) intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite in healthy volunteers.

OUTCOME MEASURES

Sixteen healthy volunteers of both genders, age 21-60, will have a 48-hour continuous intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite during which the subjects' clinical condition, blood levels of nitrite/methemoglobin, hematology, blood chemistry, and pressure will be meticulously monitored.

The first subject will receive the sodium nitrite infusion at 12 mg/48 hours. This dose, according to our knowledge from the former studies and detailed analysis of pharmacokinetics of sodium nitrite, will result in blood levels of sodium nitrite below 80 nmol/L, levels that are significantly below levels reported as normal (0.5 micromol/L to 1 micromol/L). Thus, we will use the modified accelerated titration design for Phase I Clinical studies. In the accelerated design the initial patient will start with the dose 1 nmol/min/kg/48hr, i.e. 12 mg total over 48 hours for a person weighting 60 kg. Cohorts of one new subject per dose level and double dose steps will be used during the initial accelerated stage. When the first instance of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at any dose level, the next lower dose level cohort will be expanded to three patients and revert to the use of conventional modified Fibonacci escalation/de-escalation. If no DLT is observed at level 10, the cohort will be expanded to a total of three and de-escalated as appropriate. If no more than one subject among three patients experience DLT at this dose, level 10 will be considered to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

The results of this 48-hour infusion phase 1 trial will be submitted to FDA before initiation of a 14-day clinical study.",COMPLETED,,2005-02-04,2011-05-10,2011-05-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,12,ACTUAL
NCT05002322,Expanding Health Systems Research to Optimize Hypertension Care Cascade in HIV-Infected Individuals in Mozambique,Scaling Out and Scaling Up the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach to Optimize the Hypertension Diagnosis and Care Cascade for HIV-infected Individuals,"Undiagnosed and untreated hypertension is a main driver of cardiovascular disease, affecting disproportionately low and middle-income countries, where guidelines to screen and manage hypertension are poorly used. More than 13% of Mozambique adults are infected with HIV, and over 900,000 are on anti-retroviral therapy. HIV clinics are the only services within primary care providing continued care, and can be used to standardize and scale the hypertension care cascade. Hypertension affects 40% of Mozambican adults, and thus HIV and HTN often coexist in the same person.

The investigators propose to use low-cost tools that improve service performance, promote routine hypertension diagnosis and management, and ameliorate flow through the hypertension cascade, thus improving patients outcomes. Building on a current project some districts of two provinces of central Mozambique, the investigators will establish scientific evidence on the effectiveness of a tool that uses cycles of evaluation and improvement of health system, to address the hypertension care cascade in HIV-infected people. The investigators will strengthen the framework currently in use (based on nurses) setting a novel modality delivered by district health supervisors, and will expand the geographic study area by adding 6 districts of one additional province in southern Mozambique (Maputo Province), to create a foundation for national scale-up.

The Project planning phase (two years) will develop a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders, establish national technical working groups with the participation of the provinces, and identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect uptake of the results, integration of high blood pressure and HIV services, scale-up to the entire country, and sustainability of the tested framework. Additionally, the investigators will i) conduct a six-months pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district supervisor-led intervention in one primary care facility; and, ii) redesign tools and standard operating procedures, as necessary. During the implementation phase (last three years) the investigators will deploy the district-based dissemination and implementation randomized trial in 18 health facilities - using an intervention that involves assessment, effectiveness evaluation, promotion of local uptake, implementation and maintenance - and determine the costs of the hypertension care cascade optimization, by estimating the total incremental costs.","In Mozambique HIV prevalence is over 13% and hypertension (HTN) affects 40% of adults. HIV and HTN comorbidity is increasing with the aging of HIV-infected population and expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but guideline application for HTN screening and management remains low and uneven. Around 14% of adults are aware of their HTN status and only 3% of those with HTN have their condition controlled. The HIV treatment platform is the only broadly implemented chronic care service and provides an opportunity to standardize and scale HTN screening and management.

Systems-level implementation strategies may reduce drop-offs along the HTN cascade, improve service quality, and maximize availability of efficacious HTN medicines. Systems engineering tools can identify drivers of inefficiency, support locally informed provider decision-making to prioritize solutions, and improve integration of services to reduce inefficiencies in complex, multi-step health services using simple, low cost, iterative adaptations in service delivery design. The participation of frontline staff and senior management champions in this process improves patient outcomes.

The investigators aim to describe HTN care cascade at the health facility level and use it as the entry point for systems optimization of HIV services, using cascade analysis and associated systems engineering tools. In central Mozambique a Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) identified HTN cascade steps for PLHIV, developed a HTN Cascade Analysis Tool (HCAT), mapped data sources, and developed a registry to populate the HCAT and capture study outcomes from outpatient registries and patient charts (SAIA-HTN). Building on this, our project will 'scale out' through the novel modality of delivery by district health supervisors, and 'scale up' by expanding to six districts in one additional province (SCALE SAIA-HTN). It also aims at developing a dissemination and implementation model to serve as a foundation for national scaling.

Projects Aims:

1. To develop a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders and establish HTN technical working groups at the national level and participating provinces;
2. To identify key facilitators and barriers that could affect the adoption, integration, scale-up and sustainment of the SAIA-HTN implementation strategy;
3. To conduct a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the district MOH supervisor-led SAIA-HTN intervention over six months in one primary care facility (to redesign tools and standard operating procedures as necessary);
4. Develop a district-based dissemination and implementation of SAIA-HTN (SCALE SAIA-HTN) using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model to evaluate the program: a. Determine the proportion of health facilities and population in the six districts reached, and identification of sub-groups not reached (target: 33% of facilities and 80% HIV+ adults reached); b.Assess the intervention effect on HTN process measures (BP screening, HTN diagnosis, HTN medication initiation, maintenance on HTN treatment), and HTN treatment effectiveness (HTN control, HIV viral load suppression); c.Determine the proportion of districts and facilities adopting the intervention (target: 95%), and explore the determinants of adoption identified using the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC); d.Determine core elements of the scaled SAIA-HTN implementation process and describe drivers of success/failure using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); e.Calculate the proportion of districts sustaining the intervention 9, 18, 27 months post-introduction (target: \>90% at 9 months, \>80% at 18 months, and \>65% at 27 months).
5. Determine the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization, including total incremental and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care.

Methods: The investigators will use the SAIA strategy to visualize and quantify interconnected service delivery steps, informed by previous SAIA research, epidemiologic research on HTN, and ongoing SAIA-HTN research to optimize HTN screening, care and treatment for PLHIV in central Mozambique (to evaluate SAIA-HTN's effectiveness on systems' and patient-level health outcomes for PLHIV).

Study Plan: The investigators will use multiple novel implementation science methods to understand and explain what influences implementation outcomes, including i) the CFIR to identify barriers and facilitators (determinants) to implementation, ii) the ORIC scale to assesses readiness for change as an organizational-level determinant of adoption, and iii) the RE-AIM evaluative Framework, which measures the active ingredients for public health impact (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance).

Planning phase: The investigators will mobilize a multi-sectoral stakeholder partnership, conduct a needs assessment (to evaluate facilitators and barriers that could affect adoption, integration, scale-up and sustainment of SCALE SAIA-HTN in the two provinces), and pilot the intervention's feasibility and acceptability over six months in one clinics (to refine implementation procedures for follow-on scaling out and scaling up).Implementation phase: 'scale out' SAIA-HTN to test a novel delivery modality (using district supervisors), 'scale up' to cover six districts in Maputo province, and evaluate its impact on cascade performance and patient outcomes. The investigators will randomly allocate health facilities from the six districts in Maputo Province into three implementation waves, staggered by nine months (27 months total).

The SAIA-HTN implementation strategy uses an iterative, five-step process applied at the facility level to give clinic staff and managers a systems view of cascade performance, identify priority areas for improvement, discern modifiable solutions, and test workflow modifications.

SCALE SAIA-HTN will test integration and scale up of SAIA-HTN through routine management systems relying on district Ministry of Health (MOH) supervisors as the disseminating agents (rather than research nurses), in three facilities per district during a nine-month intensive phase (mentored by study assistants), and subsequent sustainment phase (led independently by district MOH supervisors). Based on trial results, the investigators will model out the costs and potential benefits on HTN management for PLHIV given different scale-up scenarios nationwide. The trial will culminate in the development and dissemination of the SCALE SAIA-HTN package, summarizing trial results and providing implementation and cost guidance to inform policy development and support national scale-up through routine management structures.

Study design: phased-in (stepped wedge) with random assignment of two districts to each of the three nine-month intervention waves, to reach six districts in Maputo Province by the end of the trial.

Study Setting: Maputo Province (population of \>1.5 million inhabitants; \>98% of formal health services offered through public sector clinics). Health facilities with highest numbers of active HIV+ patients on ART will be enrolled.

Study Team: This project brings together a diverse and uniquely qualified team of cardiovascular, HIV, community surveys, health systems, and implementation scientists.

Procedures Stakeholders meetings: to create a multi-sectoral partnership of key stakeholders and establish HTN technical working groups (TWG) at the national level and with participating provinces.

Stakeholder field visits to SAIA-HTN trial in central Mozambique: for key personnel and district MOH supervisors from the pilot facility.

Orientation meetings/workshops: for introducing SCALE SAIA-HTN, the implementation approach, and evaluation design to study investigators, provincial MOH managers, and district MOH supervisors in each province, who will review and agree on study procedures, and clinical and organizational skills-building approaches. Throughout the two phases of the project the TWG will inform on mediators and mechanisms of action, scale-up and sustainment efforts, and ensure responsiveness to local needs; at end of the planning phase, the TWG will review findings, discuss necessary adaptations and refine SCALE SAIA-HTN for the implementation phase.

Standardized readiness assessments: in the six first wave health facilities to assess structural and organizational readiness to deliver HTN services (ORIC measures, staffing levels, attributes and training, availability of essential commodities, equipment and supplies, and infrastructure) and repeated for subsequent waves prior to launching intensive implementation phases.

Pilot study: Outpatient staff managing HIV/CVD care and district MOH supervisors will participate in orientation training for the feasibility and acceptability of the SCALE SAIA-HTN intervention, which will be carried out over six months in one primary care facility. Tools and standard operating procedures will be redesigned as necessary for the implementation phase. Facility-based HTN screening will be carried out by nurses at entry into the pilot facility; all hypertensive (new and existing) patients will be recruited, with the support of district supervisors and study teams. Feasibility and acceptability will include i) measurement of intervention fidelity, reach and exposure, and adoption; ii) knowledge and competency questionnaire to health personnel. Follow-up visits to both monitor and support implementation will be carried out twice in the first month, and monthly thereafter. Additional data will be collected by: focus group discussion (FGD) with key staff to assess acceptability of content and delivery of the intervention; questionnaire to participating staff pre and post-intervention; key informant interviews with the district supervisors, facility managers and frontline staff.

Evaluate programs' Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Reach: determine the number, proportion/representativeness of individuals reached by interventions; use study reports to estimate the proportion of facilities in the six districts reached by SCALE SAIA-HTN (target: 30%); determine the number and proportion of HIV-infected adults with HTN reached (target: 80%).

Effectiveness: HTN treatment effectiveness (primary effectiveness outcome: HTN control, Secondary outcomes: HIV viral load suppression, proportion of HIV- infected patients screened for HTN in outpatient services, HTN diagnosis, HTN prescription of eligible patients, \>90% patient adherence to HTN treatment).

Adoption: ORIC assessment scale (target of 95%) used to six frontline staff working across the HIV-HTN cascade and facility leadership in each clinic (n=108), and two supervisors (NCD and HIV) from each district (n=12) to describe determinants of adoption.

Implementation: Tools at CFIR website will be adapted to gather data via interviews and FGDs with facility and district staff (qualitative), intervention meeting minutes (qualitative), and annual quantitative questionnaires to quantify facility structural determinants of implementation of HTN management guidelines.

Maintenance. Proportion of districts sustaining the intervention as designed 9, 18 and 27 months post-introduction (target: \>90% at 9 months, \>80% at 18 months, and \>65% at 27 months). In-depth interviews and FGDs to probe district/facility perspectives on determinants of sustainment

Determination of the costs of SCALE SAIA-HTN for care cascade optimization: total incremental and unit costs of integrating HTN diagnosis and management into HIV care. For cost estimation activity-based cost menus will identify start up and recurrent activities, and measure resource use and costs from design through implementation.

NCT03285230,The French E3N Prospective Cohort Study,The French E3N Prospective Cohort Study (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale),"The French E3N cohort was initiated in 1990 to investigate the risk factors associated with cancer and other major non-communicable diseases in women.

The participants were insured through a national health system that primarily covered teachers, and were enrolled from 1990 after returning baseline self-administered questionnaires and providing informed consent. The cohort comprised nearly 100 000 women with baseline ages ranging from 40 to 65 years.

Follow-up questionnaires were sent approximately every 2-3 years after the baseline and addressed general and lifestyle characteristics together with medical events (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, fractures and asthma, among others). The follow-up questionnaire response rate remained stable at approximately 80%.

A biological material bank was generated and included blood samples collected from 25 000 women and saliva samples from an additional 47 000 women.

Ageing among the E3N cohort provided the opportunity to investigate factors related to agerelated diseases and conditions as well as disease survival.","Who is in the cohort? In June 1990, a questionnaire was sent to 500 000 women who had been born between 1925 and 1950 and were insured by the Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale (MGEN), a national health insurance plan that primarily covers teachers. The questionnaire was sent along with a leaflet explaining that an Inserm research team was launching a study of cancer risk factors and that participation would require filling in questionnaires every 2-3 years as well as the submission of a signed consent form providing permission to obtain information about each participant's vital status, address changes and medical expense reimbursements from the insurance plan. Nearly 100 000 women volunteered.

How often have they been followed-up? Until now, nine follow-up questionnaires have been sent every 2-3 years from the baseline. Approximately half of the answers were obtained after the first mailing. Two reminders were sent thereafter. The questionnaires were accompanied with newsletters that informed participants about the major results obtained to date. The participation rate remained high (77-92% according to the questionnaires) and the lost to follow-up rate was minimal because of the ability to trace non-respondents through their insurance plan files. The questionnaires were accurately filled in, with few missing or unacceptable answers.

What has been measured? To date, 11 self-administered questionnaires have been sent. The collected data are sociodemographic factors, anthropometric measurements, reproductive factors, hormonal treatments, health behaviour and lifestyle. Each follow-up questionnaire also recorded the participant's health status. The questionnaires are available at www.e3n.fr .

The questionnaires are anonymous and identified with an identification number and pin code that can be rapidly scanned to identify the respondents. The questionnaires are optically scanned and all answers are checked on screen. The scanned images are saved to allow data entry at a later time, including information regarding the addresses of medical doctors (18 000 to date) or drug names (pre-listed to avoid errors). The longitudinal data (repeats of identical questions for the purpose of updating information about topics such as menopause or smoking) are routinely homogenized. Several validation studies (e.g. dietary and anthropometrical data studies) have been performed and have revealed very satisfactory results.

Self-reported cases of cancer are validated and coded after reviewing the pathology reports obtained from medical practitioners, and nearly 90% of all cancer cases are histologically confirmed. Other diseases are also validated (e.g. diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, Parkinson disease) by requesting additional information about the participants (e.g. glycosylated haemoglobin levels, fracture-related circumstances, drug names) and sending questionnaires to medical doctors.

Additionally, a biological material bank was generated. Blood samples were initially collected from 1994-99. The participation rate among the invited participants was approximately 40%; this yielded approximately 25 000 blood samples that were each separated into 28 aliquots (e.g. plasma, serum, leukocytes, erythrocytes). Plastic straws were used to store each participant's samples in liquid nitrogen containers. The bio-repositories are located at the IARC (Lyon) and the EFS (Etablissement Français du Sang, Annemasse). Since 2004, approximately 10 case-control studies have been conducted (approximately 1 800 cases and 3 500 controls) with regard to the measurements of various biomarkers (e.g. fatty acids, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B, cholesterol and C-reactive protein). A metabolomics study is currently ongoing.

From 2009-11, saliva samples (Oragene, DNA Genotek, Kanata, ON, Canada) were requested from 68 242 living women and were obtained from 47 000 women (participation rate, 69%). Salivary DNA has been extracted and has been used for genotyping in two case-control studies (approximately 2 500 cases and 850 controls) since December 2010.

The research team is currently planning to set up a tumour tissue bank and will begin with the collection of breast cancer tissues.

What has it found? The E3N cohort has produced a spectrum of results regarding the complex roles played by nutrition, hormonal factors, physical activity, anthropometric characteristics and other major lifestyle-related factors with respect to various diseases.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,1990-06-15,2025-12-15,1991-11-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,100000,ACTUAL

The central hypothesis is that dysregulated glucose metabolism elicits a response in PAH patients that can be modified by exercise and diet, thereby leading to improvements in pulmonary vascular disease.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) leads to premature death as a consequence of increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right heart failure. PAH-targeted therapies developed over the past 20 years target excessive vasoconstriction. However, the pathobiology of PAH is more complicated, and includes dysregulated vascular cell proliferation, cellular metabolic abnormalities, and inflammation. Even with modern PAH therapies, current outcomes remain poor, with an estimated 3-year survival rate of only 55%. Thus, there is a clear need for more effective therapies, based on better understanding of the pathobiology of the disease.

Insulin resistance has emerged as a potential new mechanism in PAH. Animal models of insulin resistance are associated with PAH, which reverses with the administration of insulin sensitizing drugs. Over the past decade there has been an epidemiologic shift in PAH, where the disease is increasingly observed in older, obese, and diabetic subjects. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in PAH, a feature of insulin resistance, have been observed and found to be a strong independent predictor of PAH mortality. Elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) also correlates with PAH diagnosis and severity. As measured by the OGTT, idiopathic PAH patients have not only insulin resistance, but also an inability to mount an appropriate insulin response to a glucose challenge. These data point to dysfunction in the pancreatic beta cells of PAH patients. It is known that an exercise and low glycemic index diet intervention improves insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic subjects.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2017-09-27,2025-06-30,2022-02-18,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,34,ACTUAL

All patients, except those excluded (n=44), were open block randomized to follow two treatment regimens: ""traditional"" or ""current"" and to receive active telephone calls (""phone calls"" group) or not to receive telephone calls (""no phone calls"" group).","To evaluate the importance of providing guidelines to patients via active telephone calls for blood pressure management and the discontinuation of treatment in hypertensive patients, using two treatment regimens with low-dose medications, which were offered for free to avoid the influence of the financial factor. We opted for a regimen called ""traditional"" based on diuretics and beta-blockers, and another one called ""current"" treatment based on the angiotensin II antagonist and calcium channel blocker.

Patients and Methods The patients studied were those with essential hypertension who could receive telephone calls to be reminded of the dates of their medical appointments and to receive guidance about hypertension; patients were of both genders, from any ethnic background, over 18 years old and with body mass index below 40 kg/m2, and were enrolled in the study after signing a free and informed consent term. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors in the General Hospital at the São Paulo University School of Medicine.

Exclusion criteria were patients with blood pressure \< 140/90 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, pregnant women or nursing mothers, patients with secondary hypertension, white-coat hypertension with systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg at the doctor's office and awake mean systolic pressure \< 135 mm Hg or awake mean diastolic pressure \< 85 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication, malignant hypertension, presence of liver dysfunction evidenced by the patient's clinical history or by one of the liver function tests with levels twice the normal values (alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase), patients with clinical conditions that might interfere with the total conformity with the study or those who might have increased risk for participating in the study, patients with previous history of hypersensitivity reaction to the study medications, patients with a history of alcoholism, drug abuse or mental disorders that might invalidate the free and informed consent or limit the patient's ability to meet the protocol rules, patients who had participated in any other studies involving investigational drugs or drugs already marketed within the previous month, before enrollment in this study or concomitantly with this study.

Measurement of blood pressure was performed five times by the nursing staff in right upper limb, with patient sitting, using a cuff of appropriate size to the arm and a validated automatic oscillometric device (Dixtal, DX 2710, São Paulo, Brazil) The mean of the last two measurements was calculated and recorded as long as the difference between these measurements was less than 4 mm Hg. If after the 5 measurements the difference between the last two ones was higher than 4 mm Hg, the measurement was repeated until the difference between the two measurements was less than 4 mm Hg.

The diagnosis of hypertension was made when the mean values of the last two measurements were: systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg with or without medication in the initial visit (Visit 0). Patients who were receiving antihypertensive medication at the initial visit and had systolic pressure \< 140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure \< 90 mm Hg were re-evaluated 8 weeks after discontinuation of their medication and introduction of placebo, and they were included in the study when the mean values were systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg.

All the patients underwent Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) performed with a validated oscillometric device (SpaceLabs 90207, SpaceLabs Inc, Richmond, WA, USA) , 5 weeks after start of the placebo to eliminate the cases of patients with white-coat hypertension and in patients who did not receive placebo to identify the white coat effect.

Patients were assigned to two groups: a) ""uncomplicated"" - composed of hypertensive patients without complications and without other concurrent diseases; and b) ""complicated"", including patients with severe hypertension (mean diastolic pressure \> 110 mm Hg with or without medication) or comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus 7, renal failure (serum creatinine \> 1.4mg/dL), coronary insufficiency, congestive heart failure or prior history of cerebrovascular accident.

All patients, from both the complicated and the uncomplicated group, were open block randomized to receive active telephone calls (""phone calls"" group) or not to receive telephone calls (""no phone calls"" group) and to follow two treatment regimens: ""traditional"" and ""current"".

Thus, after the first visit and randomization, patients from the ""phone calls"" group were invited to enroll by telephone in the program called ""Biosintética Assistance"" supported by Biosintética Laboratory. The patients who subscribed started receiving active telephone calls from appropriately trained operators as well as magazines with health-related information, which were sent periodically by mail. There were 6 contacts by telephone during the study. The patient was reminded to attend the next visit; he/she received instructions about hypertension as well as any necessary clarifications. All the patients randomized to the ""phone calls"" group were invited to attend occasional informative lectures with the participation of a multidisciplinary team.

At the initial stage of treatment, the ""uncomplicated"" group received, after 8 weeks of treatment with placebo, one of the following treatment regimens: a) ""traditional"" treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg 2x/day and atenolol 25 mg 2x/day; and b) ""current"" treatment with losartan 25 mg 2x/day and amlodipine 2.5 mg 2x/day. If blood pressure could not be controlled during the visits, the medications had their doses doubled or another antihypertensive was added. The ""complicated"" group did not undergo the treatment period with placebo and was randomized to receive ""traditional"" or ""current"" drug regimens similar to the ones administered to the ""uncomplicated"" group, considering the specificity of each condition. The addition of other antihypertensive agents in the ""uncomplicated"" group, as well as the specificities of regimens of patients in the ""complicated"" group, were performed according to the guidelines from the V Brazilian Guidelines on Arterial Hypertension. 5 All the patients were instructed to take the medication every day at 7:00 am and 7:00 pm, with a variation of up to one hour. All the medication necessary for 12 months of treatment was supplied to the patients by the physician at the end of the visit in sufficient amount at no cost until the next visit, in order to eliminate the financial factor in this analysis. Patients were instructed to bring the remaining pills during their subsequent visit to be counted by the nursing staff, without the patients' knowledge of this procedure.

Doctors' visits, preceded by the nursing staff visit, took place every 8 weeks for 56 weeks with measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and weight. The weight was checked with the patient wearing light clothes and barefoot on a scale (model 2096PP, Toledo do Brasil, São Paulo, SP, Brazil).

Chronotherapy, which describes timing of a treatment with the body's daily rhythms, has recently been used with hypertension medications and has been shown to be effective at lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease events. Specifically, taking medications in the evening was shown to be more effective than morning medication routines. Little information is available about the effectiveness of chronotherapy combined with exercise (i.e., planned physical activity) interventions in older adults with hypertension.

NCT00353925,Genetic Analysis of African-Americans With High Blood Pressure,Genetic Analysis of African-American Hypertensives,"The purpose of this study is to learn if kinase, a protein found in the heart, contributes to thickening of the heart muscle in people with high blood pressure.

A protein called myosin causes the heart to contract and relax. It is thought that kinase changes myosin to make it work better at different heart rates. This study will try to determine if, in some people with high blood pressure, the different forms of this protein cause changes in the heart. If the protein affects the size of the heart, it might be possible to use it to improve heart function after an injury, such as a heart attack.

African-Americans with high blood pressure will be eligible for this study. Current data show that of almost 900 multi-ethnic individuals, the particular form of kinase under study in this project is found exclusively in the African-American population. Study participants will have two tubes of blood drawn for DNA testing to determine what form of kinase is present. An electrocardiogram will also be done if a recent one is not available. Some people may also have an echocardiogram, an ultrasound test to image the heart.","Genetic and in vitro mechanical studies in our laboratory have suggested that the perturbations in the phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) can modulate cardiac function and produce a compensatory hypertrophic response. We have cloned a novel human cardiac kinase (MLCK) that targets the cardiac RLC and identified a common allele unique to the African-American population. The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate a large group of African-American individuals with hypertension and/or cardiac disease, a portion of who will possess this allele. It is well documented that hypertensive African-Americans have an increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We expect that, in this population of hypertensive individuals, we will find an increased left ventricular mass in individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for this kinase allele.

In this study, patients with the allele can be matched to others in the cohort without the allele and evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac MRI to evaluate cardiac function and chamber size. In addition, metabolic stress testing will be performed to assess the implications of this allele on clinical performance. Another group of 75 Afro-Americans with dilated cardiomyopathy will be referred from local heart failure clinics and evaluated in a similar fashion. Allele prevalence and associated cardiac findings will also be compared with hypertensive patients matched for age and gender. In a parallel experiment, mice over-expressing this kinase, are being generated and will provide us with tissue samples with which to pursue the biophysical basis of the mechanical changes in muscle function.",COMPLETED,,1999-10-05,2007-12-10,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1000,

In particular, this study will examine the use of conduction system pacing (CSP) in clinical practice. Information collected in the registry will help researchers better characterize strengths and limitations of current technology and treatments.","During this past decade, there has been a dramatic surge in interest in new physiologic pacing strategies which engage and take advantage of the intrinsic cardiac conduction system. These approaches include His bundle pacing (HBP) as well as approaches which seek to pace the proximal left conduction system (LCS), including left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) or pacing in the region of the left posterior fascicle. Left ventricular septal pacing (LVS) has also been proposed as another means to avoid dyssynchrony with early data suggestive of comparable electrical synchronization as biventricular pacing. These approaches utilize approved pacing systems and leads which are delivered to new targets in the His-Purkinje system or LV endocardial fibers. Despite the growing interest in HBP, LCS, and LVS, the majority of data are from disparate cohort studies and there has been a lack of uniformity in assembling data or analyzing and interpreting outcomes.

The goal of the Conduction System Pacing International Registry (CONSPIRE) is to systematically and prospectively collect data across multiple centers of excellence on the early implementation of permanent conduction system pacing devices in order to characterize strengths and limitations of current technology.

The effects of self-measuring of the blood pressure at home and the use of a pro-active web-based feedback system on the blood pressure, number of antihypertensive drugs used, and surrogate cardiovascular markers during a 12 month period will be investigated.","Patients are assigned to the intervention or control group (1:1 ratio) by the research nurse based on a computer-generated allocation sequence. Stratified randomization will be performed to allocate equal numbers of patients with and without diabetes in both groups. This is an open trial without masking of the participants or investigators. Outcome measures are not blinded.

Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study. After informed consent is given, all patients will be seen by the nurse practitioner and the doctor (coordinator of the study) for an intake. During this intake patients will be informed about the study, medical history will be taken, questionnaires are completed a physical examination is performed and BP measurements and laboratory tests are performed. The patients will also receive information about hypertension and personal lifestyle advises during the intake. After inclusion, patients are randomized into two groups:

1. Control group: After the intake the patients will receive usual care at the outpatient clinic. After one year the coordinator of the study and the nurse practitioner will see the control group patients for a final evaluation. During this evaluation, the questionnaires, measurements and laboratory tests are repeated.
2. Intervention group: After the intake, patients receive a HBP-monitor and a login account to a personal website. Furthermore, instructions about the use of the home blood pressure monitor and the website will be given. The web-based program can be used by the patient to upload the blood pressure readings and to communicate with the nurse practitioner or to the doctor and vice versa. Patients can ask questions daily and will receive personal lifestyle advices on monthly basis. If needed, medication adjustments will be made based on the blood pressure measurements. Online information will be provided to the patients as a reference work with information about hypertension, treatment strategies and technical facts of the blood pressure monitor and the website. Patients in the intervention group will visit their own physician in the OPD after 6 months, instead of every 3 months. If necessary patients can visit their physician earlier. If patients have multiple diseases, regular visits to the internal medicine department are not restricted.

After 12 months, patients in the intervention and control groups are seen for the final evaluation.

Data registered only during intake:

* Medication
* Quality of life: This is assessed by the SF-12 Health Survey
* Physical examination:

  * Height and weight, BMI
  * Waist circumference
  * Blood pressure: This will be measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and an office blood pressure (OBP) measurement.
  * Signs of secondary hypertension
  * Signs of organ damage
* Lifestyle habits:

  * Physical activity: The level of physical activity is measured with the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) \[19\].
  * Diet: Saturated fat intake and Fruit and Vegetable intake are measured with two validated Dutch Questionnaires \[20, 21\]. Salt intake is measured with 24-hour urine analysis.
  * Alcohol consumption: Respondents are asked how much glasses alcohol they drink per week on average.
  * Smoking: Smoking status is assessed by asking respondents if they are current smokers (what they smoke, how much they smoke, intention to quit smoking), an ex-smoker (how many pack years or never-smoked).
  * Quality of life: This is measured by the SF-12-health survey
* Laboratory tests:

  * Thyroid-stimulating hormone
  * Microalbuminuria / proteinuria (24-hour urine collection)

Measurement procedures:

In both groups a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement will be performed at the start of the study and after 12 months. After the start of the study, the intervention group will measure their own blood pressure with the use of the ""Microlife WatchBP"" Home blood pressure monitor with an inflatable cuff for the upper arm. This meter is approved by the Dutch Heart Foundation \[18\]. The measurements are automatically transferred to a secured website (https://www.bpathome.com/main/ageneral.html) when the meter is connected with a computer using an USB-portal. This website can be approached by the caregivers and the patients. Patients are instructed to measure according to the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for blood pressure monitoring at home. During HBP measurement the following recommendations are made:

* The arm must be supported (on a table)
* The arm is positioned at heart level
* All measurements are performed on the same arm (arm with highest blood pressure during intake)
* During intake the size of the inflatable bladder is determined (length of inflatable bladder should cover 80-100% of the arm circumference, the width is half that length)
* The centre of the bladder is placed over the brachial artery.

The intervention group will measure their BP according to the guideline for blood pressure monitoring at home:

- HBP is monitored for 7 days at a stretch every month with two morning and two evening measurements. The average of all values will be used for clinical decision making, with the exception of the first day, which will be discarded.

Diagnostic and therapeutic thresholds:

Cut-off limits for conventional blood pressure measures are not applicable for HBPM, therefore different cut-off limits are used. Hypertension will be diagnosed by HBPM starting at BP levels of 135/85 mmHg for patients without diabetes and 130/75 mmHg for patients with Diabetes. The target HBP for therapy is below these thresholds. For OBP, hypertension will be diagnosed at BP levels of 140/90 mmHg for patients without diabetes and 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes, the target OBP is below this threshold.

Safety limits are set on readings greater than 200/100 mmHg or systolic BP less than 80 mmHg, which will trigger an alert in the system.

Pharmacological therapy:

All patients enrolled in the study will continue their current blood pressure medication.

The medication and dose adjustments in patients randomized to the intervention group will be done monthly by the nurse practitioner or the coordinating physician based on their HBP measurements. Patients in the study group can communicate with the coordinating doctor by the secured website. Medication adjustments are made by a physician and communicated by the web-based system or telephone. Medication adjustments are made based on the European guidelines. When necessary the doctor who coordinates the study can consult a senior physician to discuss about the medication changes. These patients will see there own physicians 6 months after the inclusion, provided these patients only have hypertension. If patients have multiple diseases, regular visits are not restricted. The head of the outpatients clinic will supervise the coordinating doctor during the study.

Patients randomized to the non-intervention group will receive usual care and their own specialist will make the necessary medication adjustments, during their visits to the outpatient clinic or during hospitalization.

Lifestyle interventions:

Patients in the intervention group will receive both general and personal lifestyle-advices every month and when patients have questions about lifestyle.

Multiple aspects will be taken into account:

* Smoking cessation: For counseling and help with smoking cessation, the guidelines of a Dutch expert centre for tobacco control 'STIVORO' will be followed.
* Moderation of alcohol consumption: Advice on alcohol consumption is based on the national guidelines of acceptable alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Women are advised not to drink more than one consumption a day and men are advised not to drink more than 2 consumptions a day. Furthermore the risks associated with binge-drinking are explained.
* Regular physical activity: Patients are advised to put together at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on at least five days a week, according to the guideline of healthy physical activity in the primary care. Moderate to intense exercise includes for example: walking, cycling, gardening, swimming and dancing.
* Reduction of high salt and fat intake: Patients are advised not to consume more than 6 grams of salt during the day. Furthermore the total daily intake of fat is aimed to be less than 30% of total daily energy intake and the saturated fatty acids less than 10% of total daily energy intake. Dietary interventions are based on the national guidelines of healthy diet.",UNKNOWN,,2011-09,2013-03,2013-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,300,ESTIMATED

The approach to this risk factor can be pharmacological and non-pharmacological. The non-pharmacological approach is based on lifestyle modification. Among the measures aimed at modifying lifestyles is the restriction of daily intake of sodium in the diet. Such restriction enhances the hypotensive effect of pharmacological treatment so that its application and intensification would delay the start of pharmacological therapy, as well as avoid the need to increase the dose of antihypertensive drugs or the number of drugs to be used for the control of hypertension.

In relation to salt intake in the Spanish population, the average is above the figures of less than 5 grams per day recommended by the WHO. Sodium intake can be estimated by determining the 24-hour urine sodium concentration. In addition, there is a positive correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure figures and the excretion of sodium in urine.","In the present work, with a prospective cohort observational study design, it intends to assess the effectiveness of the use of an educational program based on the follow up of a hyposodium diet and assessed through the routine use of urine sodium monitoring of the hypertensive patient in the primary care setting, in order to optimize treatment, as well as to review the clinical control in this group of patients. On the other hand, it is intended to establish guidelines in the form of practical guidelines to provide with a standardized clinical approach for primary care centers.",TERMINATED,the principal investigator withdraws from the project for personal reasons,2020-09-01,2022-09-01,2022-09-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,2,ACTUAL
NCT00005325,Identifying Genes Involved in Abnormal Blood Pressure - Hypertension SCOR,,To seek out genes or genetic markers which identify subjects more vulnerable to hypertension under the influence of environmental factors.,"BACKGROUND:

Essential hypertension is a multifactorial disorder with a Gaussian distribution and with a genetic component that appears to be polygenic and heterogeneous. The studies require clinical knowledge of the pathophysiology and therapy of hypertension, availability of a large racially diverse patient population and a General Clinical Research Center for recruitment, characterization and classification of subjects, in combination with knowledge of molecular biology for DNA preparation and expertise in molecular genetics and molecular epidemiology for genetic analysis.

The study is part of a Specialized Centers of Research initiative in the Molecular Genetics of Hypertension. The initiative originated in deliberations of the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. In May 1993, a program evaluation committee convened by the NHLBI was charged with the task of assessing the overall goals of the Hypertension SCOR program and of recommending areas of future need. The committee's recommendations formed the basis of this proposed initiative which was released as a Request for Applications in December, 1993.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study, a subproject within a Hypertension Specialized Center of Research (SCOR), had five substudies between 1996 and 2001. The first classified hypertensives into relatively homogeneous subgroups according to intermediate phenotypes based on heritable biological traits, including anthropometric and neurohumoral data obtained by submitting selected subjects to a 3-day inpatient protocol, from which data were extrapolated and applied to stratify larger subject populations in order to enhance efficacy of subsequent genetic analysis. The second substudy genotyped subjects for chromosomal loci using approximately 350 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers spaced every 5-10 centimorgans (cM) along each chromosome. The strategy was to initially type markers in a select group of hypertensive kindreds that independently demonstrated linkage. The third substudy analyzed the genetic marker data for linkage using both parametric (lod score) and nonparametric (affected-pedigree-member) methods. Suggestive findings were pursued in the sib-pairs. The fourth substudy used the case-control method to confirm positive linkage from substudy 3 and to identify particular allele associations using methods of linkage disequilibrium and DNA pooling. The fifth substudy screened and assessed mutations in candidate genes linked to hypertension in patients and controls. A collaboration was established with the Framingham Heart Study, with linkage analyses conducted for hypertension in this cohort.

The subproject was renewed in February 2001 through 2006 to continue the clinical studies and to expand the collection of hypertensive families, including subjects who have undergone extensive clinical evaluation and who can be subgrouped into intermediate phenotypes, as well as families from genetically isolated populations from Greece, Israel, and South Africa. Various subsets of this population will be submitted to different genetic analyses as appropriate, including linkage and association studies, genome-wide scan for genetic isolates, evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected genes, testing of quantitative trait loci (QTL) by micro satellite markers and mapping of promising marrow regions by DNA sequencing.",COMPLETED,,1996-02,2006-07,2006-07,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,0,

NCT00005222,Decline in Cardiovascular Mortality: Framingham 1950-1984,,To investigate possible mechanisms responsible for the decline in cardiovascular disease mortality among the Framingham Heart Study population and to evaluate the health status of survivors in terms of subsequent illness and functional limitations.,"BACKGROUND:

Cardiovascular disease mortality has declined more than 30 percent in the last thirty years. Almost two-thirds of this decline occurred between 1970 and 1980. Despite this decreased mortality, cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death. It is also the disease category associated with the most rapidly rising health care costs. Secular trends in lifestyle, self-care, improved access to medical care, and improvements in diagnostic and curative medicine have all been implicated. An understanding of the mechanisms contributing to this decline is necessary in order to develop a scientific basis for palliative and preventive care. Also, the dramatic decline in cardiovascular disease mortality has raised the issue of the quality of life among the survivors. The question is raised whether more people are surviving but with worsening health in terms of increased incidence and prevalence of disease as well as increased levels of functional limitation.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Five hypotheses were tested to address the issue of secular trends in lifestyle, self-care and medical care which may have influenced cardiovascular disease mortality. These were: differences in risk factor levels among similarly-aged birth cohorts influenced mortality by lessening the severity of disease or by improving recuperative capacity; mortality among the later birth cohorts declined due to less comorbid disease at the time of the disease event; long-term case fatality declined because the progression of disease was slower as evidenced by a reduction in disease recurrence; medical intervention reduced mortality by eliminating lethal sequelae in the later birth cohorts; decreased mortality resulted from medical innovations in diagnosis and therapy. Three hypotheses were tested to address the issue of worsening health among the survivors in the later birth cohorts. These were: although more individuals in the later birth cohorts survived 13 years of follow-up than did members of similarly-aged birth cohorts in earlier periods, they had higher rates of morbidity and were hospitalized more often; survivors in the later cohorts exhibited more disability in functional limitations; more survivors in the later cohorts were institutionalized in chronic care hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. Data on risk factors, co-morbidity, and recurrent cardiovascular disease in the three birth cohorts were already computerized. Data on medical interventions, improvement in case management, and the use of various technological innovations were abstracted from medical records and linked with the data on disease events. Data on functional limitations were available both by type and extent of disability from the Disability Analysis of Health Data, a study supported by the Social Security Administration. This data file was merged with the file for disease events to determine if general differences in functional health existed among the three birth cohorts at intake, and if between-cohort differences existed among survivors.

The study was renewed as a Shannon Award in Fiscal 1991.

NCT01990625,A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Ultrasound Use to Improve Pregnancy Outcomes in Low Income Country Settings,Global Network First Look: A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Ultrasound Use to Improve Pregnancy Outcomes in Low Income Country Settings,"In many low-income countries, the use of ultrasound by medical officers and non-physician health care staff (e.g., midwives) for antenatal identification of high risk pregnancies is a new intervention requiring authoritative investigation. The primary hypothesis to be assessed in this study is that antenatal ultrasound screenings performed by medical officers and non-physician health care staff will significantly reduce a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and maternal near miss, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. Underpinning this hypothesis are two assumptions. The first assumption is that antenatal detection of complicated pregnancies will lead to appropriate referral at the right time for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. The second assumption is that ultrasound's introduction will increase antenatal attendance leading to greater rates of institutional delivery. To assess these underlying assumptions beyond the composite end point, this study will investigate the health system impact of compact ultrasound. Secondary outcomes include antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC facilities, referral rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both planned and emergent) and an assessment of medical officers and non-physician health care provider ultrasound competence and training quality.","The use of ultrasound by physician and non-physician health care staff for antenatal identification of complicated pregnancies is a potentially effective intervention; however, authoritative investigation in many low-resource settings is needed to establish its potential impact. The investigators propose to undertake a multi-country, cluster randomized trial to assess the impact of antenatal ultrasound screening performed by community physician and non-physician health care staff on a composite outcome consisting of maternal mortality and near miss maternal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. Underpinning this objective are several assumptions. The first assumption is that ultrasound's introduction will increase antenatal attendance and improved outcomes due to the antenatal care alone, and greater rates of institutional delivery. The second assumption is that ultrasound use will lead to antenatal detection of complicated pregnancies and timely and appropriate referral for complicated pregnancies to comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) facilities. Increases in antenatal care utilization and referral will result in a decrease in a composite outcome including maternal mortality and near miss mortality, stillbirth and neonatal death. Secondary outcomes to be evaluated include antenatal attendance rates, institutional delivery rates at basic EmONC facilities, referral rates to comprehensive EmONC facilities, cesarean section rates (both planned and emergent), an assessment of community physician and non-physician health care provider ultrasound training and competence and the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound in community health facilities. The investigators will also determine causes for non-compliance with recommendations for referral.

In summary, this trial will evaluate whether training antenatal health care providers to perform basic obstetric ultrasonography, and using these trainees to provide routine ultrasounds in primary care clinics and to refer appropriately will improve pregnancy outcomes in low-resource settings.

To assess the impact of ultrasound, the investigators propose to utilize an existing research infrastructure, the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research (Global Network), which currently includes 7 sites in 6 countries, India (2), Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, DRC and Guatemala. The investigators of the Global Network have an ongoing maternal and newborn health registry to document all pregnancies and their outcomes to 6 weeks post-delivery in more than 100 communities. Thus, population-based rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality and morbidity, as well as health care utilization, are being obtained. A sub-set of these clusters will be utilized for the ultrasound trial.

RTI International serves as the data coordinating center for the Global Network to help facilitate the design and conduct of the trial, manage the trial related data, and provide statistical analyses of the trial results. GE Healthcare will provide the ultrasound equipment, and will also fund the University of Washington to provide training and technical support on the implementation of ultrasound in community settings. Together, the Global Network with the support of the University of Washington and GE Healthcare will maximize the resources necessary to conduct a definitive trial on the potential impact of ultrasound to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and maternal morbidity in low-resource settings.",COMPLETED,,2014-04,2016-09,2016-08,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,45038,ACTUAL

NCT05349825,Investigation of MDR1 Gene Polymorphism and Losartan Plasma Concentration in Patients Undergoing Hypertensive Episodes While Under Losartan Treatment,"Investigation of MDR1 (Multi-Drug Resistance) Gene Polymorphism and Losartan Plasma Concentration in Patients Undergoing Hypertensive Episodes While Under Losartan Treatment: A Prospective, Case-Control Study","Losartan is an antihypertensive drug belonging to the ARB family. It is characterized as the substrate of the Multi Drug Resistance-1 (MDR1) drug-efflux protein (a pump that ensures the removal of drugs/foreign substances out of the cell) encoded by the ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1 (ABCB1) gene. A recent line of evidence indicates that potential polymorphisms in this gene tend to alter the absorption, transport, bioavailability of losartan, and, indirectly, its effectiveness in hypertension control. As identified by new research, the C3435T, G2677T, and C1236T polymorphic alleles of the MDR1 gene might alter the bioavailability and thus the effectiveness of losartan","This trial was conducted in the emergency services of Gazi University and Pamukkale University. The patient group was comprised of 50 individuals presenting with a hypertensive episode (patients under 60, \>140/90 mmHg, patients over 60, \>150/90 mmHg, according to the JNC8 guidelines) while under losartan treatment. The control group, by contrast, included 50 patients whose blood pressure was regulated while receiving losartan treatment and who were admitted to the ED for reasons other than hypertensive episode. The eligible patients matching the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study.

Within the scope of this research, we included hypertension patients over 18 who gave their informed consent for the study and received minimum 25 mg losartan daily for at least six weeks. 50 individuals admitted to the ED due to a hypertensive episode while under losartan treatment were assigned to the patient group, while 50 patients whose blood pressure was regulated while receiving losartan treatment and who were admitted to the ED for reasons other than hypertensive episode were included in the control group. Those who did not give their consent to participate and did not match the inclusion criteria were excluded from the scope of the study Prior to the trial, the participants were assessed based on the pre-defined patient selection criteria, and the non-eligible ones were excluded from the trial.

NCT00553722,Does Aldosterone Cause Hypertension by a Non-Renal Mechanism?,Does Aldosterone Cause Hypertension by a Non-Renal Mechanism?,"It is well known that Aldosterone (aldo) can cause hypertension (HBP). Since aldo is known to cause the kidney to retain sodium (Na) and Na retention is known to cause HBP, it has been thought that the mechanism by which aldo causes HBP is by Na retention. Recent studies have suggested that aldo has many effects in addition to its ability to cause the kidney to retain Na. To test the hypothesis that aldo can cause HBP in a manner which does not involve Na retention, we plan, in this protocol, to give Eplerenone, a specific aldo antagonist, to patients on dialysis who have HBP. A positive effect of Eplerenone to lower HBP in these patients would support this hypothesis.","Background Shortly after the structure of aldosterone (aldo) was determined (1) in 1952, its effect on the kidney to cause sodium (Na) retention and potassium (K) and hydrogen ion (H) excretion were characterized (2,3). Although the ability of aldo to effect many transporting epithelia is now well known, it is this effect on the kidney to retain sodium which is felt to play an important role in Na retention to cause edema and, in some settings, hypertension (HBP).

Aldo was shown by Edelman (4) to bind to a specific receptor and then be transported into the nucleus of aldo responsive cells and subsequently lead to the production of aldo-induced proteins. The first aldo receptor antagonist )ARA(, spironolactone, has been used clinically for over 30 years in the management of edema and in the past few years a new agent Eplerenone, which is structurally similar to spironolactone, but without the side effect of gynecomastia, has come into clinical use in the USA and in Israel.

Treatment of HBP is usually directed at the cause of the HBP if it is known, for example, removal of tumors releasing catecholamines and correcting renal artery stenosis. If HBP is due to primary aldosteronism, then surgical removal of the tumor, or use of an ARA is usually effective (5,6). When the cause of the HBP is not known, traditionally called essential hypertension, therapy today frequently involves drugs that interfere with the RAS (7), but until recently the addition of an ARA was not usually included. Recently studies by Epstein and others (8,9) have shown that the addition of an ARA to the drug management of what has been considered essential HPB can further reduce HBP by over 10 mmHg, thus suggesting that the addition of an ARA to the routine tools available to treat HBP is important. Although the mechanism by which this addition of an ARA lowers HBP is not clear, the obvious suggestion is that by blocking the effect of aldo on the kidney to reabsorb Na there is an increased excretion of Na which is responsible for the lowering of HBP.

In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), at the time they start dialysis HBP is common and has been attributed to volume overload or an active RAS (10). Early in the history of hemodialysis the potential for the RAS to be involved in causing HBP was unclear, but studies with saralasin (11,12), a competitive angiotensin II antagonist, clearly showed that in dialysis patients with elevated plasma renin levels the renin was involved in causing HBP by leading to the generation of angiotensin II. Although a number of other mechanisms apart from volume and angiotensin II have been considered, there is little evidence today that any, including aldo, play a regular role in causing HBP in the dialysis setting.

Because of the possibility that aldosterone may contribute to the HBP of patients on dialysis, independent of an effect on sodium excretion (since such patients excrete little urine), this protocol is designed to test this possibility by administering an ARA to patients on chronic dialysis with HBP. A positive result would strongly suggest that there is an effect to lower HBP independent of sodium excretion. Such a result would be indicative of a non-Na mechanism for ARA to lower HBP in dialysis patients, but would also suggest the possibility of ARA acting by a non-Na mechanism in lowering HBP in essential HBP.

Is hyperkalemia a concern in this protocol? Although there is evidence that aldo can facilitate potassium excretion, even in patients with renal failure (13) by increasing GI excretion, there have been several studies recently which demonstrate that spironolactone (14,15) or Eplerenone (16) can be given to renal failure/ dialysis patients without the development of hyperkalemia. Thus, it seems that these ARAs can be given to patients with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis, without hyperkalemia routinely developing. Nevertheless, in this protocol, plasma potassium will be regularly measured to minimize the development of hyperkalemia.

A very small study addressed this question using Spironolactone (14). Since it has been shown that Eplerenone does not cause gynecomastia in men, and many of our dialysis patients are men, we will use this drug, rather than Spironolactone, in this study.

Rational and Aims The role of aldo to cause HBP by a Na retaining mechanism is well described. Since recent studies suggest that aldo may have other mechanisms of action, this protocol will address the possibility that aldo can cause HBP by a non-Na retaining mechanism. This will be done by giving an ARA, Eplerenone, to patients with HBP on dialysis. In these patients the kidney plays no role in Na regulation. Thus, if BP falls with Eplerenone, these observations would strongly support the hypothesis than aldo can cause HBP by a non-Na retaining mechanism.

Methods We will select study participants from adult hemodialysis patients treated thrice weekly at Shaare Zedek Medical Center Dialysis Unit. Men and women will qualify for the study if they were on hemodialysis therapy for more than 3 months, have an average predialysis plasma potassium concentration less than 5.6 mEq/L at the time of enrollment and have nil or minimal urine output (\<500 mL/24 h). All participating women of childbearing age will have a negative pregnancy test result before entering into the study. Additional exclusion criteria will include a known allergy to Spironolactone or Eplerenone; any acute illness; hypotension, defined as a predialysis systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg; severe hypertension (predialysis systolic blood pressure \>180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure \>100 mm Hg); decompensated heart failure; inability to give informed consent; and noncompliance. The Institutional Review Board of Shaare Zedek Medical Center will be asked to give approval to the study protocol. All participants will give written-informed consent.

We plan on enrolling 27 patients in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study. At study start, participants will be administered either Eplerenone, 25 mg, or a placebo tablet orally twice daily for 4 weeks. This 4-week period will be followed by a 3-week washout period. After the washout period, patients will cross over in their treatment arms for 4 more weeks. Patients administered Eplerenone for the first 4 weeks will be given placebo for the last 4 weeks, and vice versa. All patients will serve as their own controls.

Participants will receive outpatient hemodialysis 3 times a week using B. Braun CE0123 machines (B. Braun, D-34212 Meisungen, Germany). All patients will use B. Braun polysulfone membranes. To control for the effects of volume on blood pressure and the RAS, we plan to keep target postdialysis weight (dry weight) constant for each patient during the study. Dialysate sodium concentrations will be held constant at 140 mEq/L for all patients, dialysate potassium concentrations will be maintained at 2 mEq/L thru the study. We do not plan to impose additional dietary potassium restrictions beyond the usual recommendations for patients with ESRD treated with hemodialysis. We plan to make no changes to dialysate potassium concentrations or antihypertensive regimens. Because of a mandate not to alter the antihypertensive regimen, target weight, and dialysis potassium bath during the study, we will exclude patients with hypotension, severe hypertension, and hyperkalemia. To evaluate the effect of Eplerenone independent of its diuretic action, we plan to include only oliguric or anuric patients (urine output \<500 mL/24 h).

We plan to determine predialysis and postdialysis weights, interdialytic weight gains (IDWGs), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures for each patient by calculating an average of 3 measurements obtained during 1 week before the administration of any study medication (baseline), during each week of placebo and Eplerenone treatment, and during the last week of the washout period. At the beginning and end of each treatment period, we plan to measure predialysis and postdialysis plasma potassium and aldosterone levels, renin activity (PRA), and, on a nondialysis day, 24-hour urine excretion of sodium, potassium, and creatinine. We plan to monitor predialysis plasma potassium concentrations weekly in all subjects. Predialysis blood samples will be obtained after cannulation of the vascular access before the start of the dialysis session. We plan to obtain postdialysis blood samples from a predialyzer blood sample port at the end of the hemodialysis session after slowing the blood pump to 50 to 100 mL/min. Shaare Zedek Medical Center Laboratory will perform all laboratory tests.

Statistical Methods Results will be presented as mean ± SD. To compare clinical and laboratory parameters, Student t-test will be used for paired samples. Linear regression and correlation will be used to assess the relationship between 2 variables. Stepwise regression will be used to identify predictors of a single variable. P less than 0.05 will be used to define statistical significance. We will perform all statistical analyses using standard software packages.",UNKNOWN,,2007-11,2009-11,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,TRIPLE,DIAGNOSTIC,27,ESTIMATED
