NCT06375694,Probiotic Effect on Dietary Nitrate to Plasma Nitrite Production ( OPEDNPN ),Oral Probiotic Effect on Dietary Nitrate to Plasma Nitrite Production,"Nitric Oxide (NO) is an important molecule that is produced naturally in the body and that helps maintain healthy blood flow. Low availability of NO contributes to many diseases while administration of NO is therapeutic.

In addition to being made naturally in the body, NO can be obtained through the diet via the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle. Nitrate, which is abundant in green leafy vegetables and beetroot juice, is partially converted to nitrite by oral bacteria. The nitrate and nitrite are taken up into the blood and nitrite is converted into NO. Remaining nitrate in the blood is taken back up into the mouth by salivary glands and the cycle continues. Emerging studies suggest that the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle may contribute to cardiovascular health. In addition, there have been many studies where dietary nitrate is given to increase NO and treat various conditions.

The current study rests on the premise that the quality of the oral microbiome plays a major role in the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle and hence cardiovascular health and the efficacy of dietary nitrate interventions. Investigators have begun to identify oral bacterial species that are effective nitrite producers as well as though that are nitrite depleters (those that interfere with nitrite production from nitrate).

In laboratory experiments, certain bacterial species have been shown to block nitrate to nitrite conversion by other oral bacteria. These nitrite depleting species are found in a commercially available oral probiotic designed to improve oral health. The purpose of this study is to examine if use of the probiotic negatively affects the Nitrate-Nitrite-NO cycle. Nitrate to Nitrite conversion will be assessed by measuring plasma levels of nitrite before and after consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice. Dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite conversion will assessed at baseline and after one week of consumption of the probiotic or a placebo (follow-up). The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants that consume the probiotic will have lower nitrate to nitrite conversion at follow-up compared to baseline and that there will be no significant change in nitrate to nitrite conversion between baseline and follow-up for participants who consume the placebo.

While this study does not aim to treat any specific disease, it is intended to elucidate a basic physiological function that may be relevant to cardiovascular health and certain NO-based therapeutics.","Background

Nitric oxide (NO) plays critical roles in a myriad of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology and function of various organs and systems.1,2 Low NO bioavailability contributes to pathology in multiple diseases including hemolytic anemias,3 malaria,4,5 transfusion of older stored blood,6,7 chronic heart failure,8 atherosclerosis,9 and diabetes.10 Recent reports suggest that the oral microbiome is linked with regulating NO homeostasis through the action of certain bacteria that have an ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite.11-15 Nitrite is then further reduced to NO through a variety of mechanisms in different tissues.16,17 Plasma nitrate is taken up back into the oral cavity by salivary glands so that the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle provides sustained increases in NO bioavailability. Many clinical studies have used dietary nitrate as a source of NO through nitrite conversion.18-24 However, there is substantial variability in the clinical outcomes due to dietary nitrate intake and this is reflected in variability in the amount of nitrate converted to plasma nitrite.13,24-29 30. The variability and hence a large overall limitation in efficacy of dietary nitrate based treatments has been attributed to the capacity of the oral microbiome to reduce nitrate to nitrite.24-27 Preliminary work has begun to identify bacterial strains that are efficient nitrate to nitrite converters as well as those that actually inhibit nitrate to nitrite conversion.31,32 The efficiency of the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle and the role of oral bacteria may contribute to normal health.11 Thus, understanding the variability in nitrate to nitrite conversion and aspects of the oral microbiome could lead to improvements in normal cardiovascular health. In addition, in order to maximize benefits from dietary nitrate interventions, we need to understand factors of the oral microbiome that affect nitrate to nitrite conversion. The investigators have recently discovered that several species of Lactobacillus produce a metabolite that blunts nitrate to nitrite conversion by other oral bacteria in vitro. Several of these Lactobacillus species are the main component of a commercially available oral probiotic, https://www.amazon.com/Dental-Probiotics-Breath-Gingivitis-Throat/dp/B096SZSFFS

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to determine if Lactobacillus will blunt dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite conversion.

The investigators hypothesize that the presence of oral Lactobacillus will blunt the conversion of dietary nitrate to plasma nitrite and will test this by comparing the conversion before and after use of this probiotic.

The main hypothesis rests on the auxiliary hypothesis that use of the oral probiotic will results in increased abundance of Lactobacillus in the oral cavity and will test this through genomic sequencing.

Methods OPEDNPN All eligible volunteers will be consented after learning about the study and agreeing to participate. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) Probiotic and (2) Placebo. A total of 20 volunteers (10 per group) will participate in the study. The only difference for participants for each group will be whether they receive the placebo or probiotic.

All volunteers will participate in two visits: (1) Visit 1, baseline and (2) Visit 2, follow up. At each visit, volunteers will report to the Olin Physical Lab room 208 after having fasted for 3 hours prior. They can drink water one hour before the visit. Participants will be instructed not to use anti-bacterial mouthwash the day of the visit. The participant will be asked to provide 4 mL of saliva and a study team member will collect a bacterial sample from the posterior dorsal surface of their tongue (as described below). These samples will be frozen at -80 degrees for genetic analysis and identification of bacterial strains.

After saliva and tongue samples are collected, blood will be drawn (as described below) for plasma nitrite and nitrate determination. This blood sample will be the ""pre-"" sample collected at baseline and follow-up. Volunteers will then drink one 70 mL Beet it Sport Nitrate 400 shot (https://www.beet-it.us/pages/beet-it-sports). A ""post-"" blood draw will be collected 2.5 hours after consumption of the beetroot juice.

At Visit 1, after the second blood draw, volunteers will receive 7 days worth of either probiotic or the placebo. Volunteers will consume the probiotic (or placebo) as indicated by the manufacturer of the probiotic once a day. On day 8, the volunteers will return for visit 2.

The data will include (1) baseline and follow-up analysis of oral bacterial strains and (2) Pre- and post-beet juice consumption plasma nitrite and nitrate levels. The investigators hypothesize that the abundance of Lactobacillus will be higher at follow-up compared to baseline for volunteers taking the probiotic but that there will be no change in the placebo group. The investigators also hypothesize that the change in plasma nitrite (post minus pre) will be lower at follow-up than at baseline for volunteers taking the probiotic but that there will be no change in the placebo group.

* Study Materials (all commercially available):

  1. Placebo: Honest Placebo Pills by Zeebo
  2. Herbiotics Oral + Ent Probiotic
  3. Beet it Sport Nitrate 400 shot
* Collection of Saliva and Tongue scraping. Volunteers will report to the Olin Physical Lab room 208 after having fasted for 3 hours prior. They can drink water one hour before the visit. Participants will be instructed not to use anti-bacterial mouthwash the day of the visit. The participant will be asked to provide 4 mL of saliva by spitting into a microcentrifuge tube. For the tongue samples, a HydraFlock 6"" Sterile Large Flock Swab w/Polystyrene Handle (Puritan Medical) will be used to collect scrapings. Volunteers will be asked to open their mouths as wide as possible and stick out their tongue. The posterior 1/3 of the dorsal surface of the tongue will be sampled by scraping lightly to moderately firmly the dorsal surface of the tongue back and forth Scraping will take a minute or so. The tongue scraping will be placed in 0.85 mL of buffered sterile saline and 0.15 mL glycerol. All samples will be frozen at -80°C and sent to Professor Hariom Yadav at the University of South Florida for genomic analysis.
* Blood draws and processing Blood will be drawn by a certified, trained phlebotomist. Blood samples (maximum \~10 mL) will be collected from participants following consent. Blood will be collected at each visit pre and 2.5 hours post beet juice consumption. Blood will be drawn as close to the 2.5 hour mark as possible. Realistically, it may occur between 2 to 3 hours after the final study beverage is consumed. Blood will be drawn by lab personnel with certified phlebotomy training via standard venipuncture methods or Tasso HemolinkTM device. The HemoLinkTM is an FDA-approved blood collection device that uses small lancets and gentle suction to collect a very small sample (\~ ¼ teaspoons) of blood. Blood will be collected in standard blood collection tubes (e.g. citrate (blue-top), EDTA (purple-top) and heparin (green-top)) and labeled appropriately. The preferred tube is a 4 mL heparin tube. All blood samples drawn for research purposes will be identified by the study participant number and date/time of collection, which will also be recorded on the standardized data collection form. No personal identifying information will be included on the samples processed for research purposes. All blood samples will be immediately spun immediately in a centrifuge at 600-800g for five minutes and the supernatant collected. The plasma will be frozen on dry ice and then stored at -80°C for analysis of nitrite and nitrate content.
* Probiotic or placebo consumption Both the probiotic and placebo will be consumed twice a day according to instructions for the probiotic. One capsule is chewed or allowed to melt in the volunteer's mouth and then the contents are switched around in the mouth before being swallowed.

Risks Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn from patients willing to participate. This will be done in the usual fashion, preparing the venipuncture site with the local anesthetic EMLA, then drawing blood through a small gauge (23 or 21) butterfly needle. Drawing blood from a vein may be associated with discomfort or bruising at the site of needle puncture. Rarely, fainting or infection at the site of needle puncture may occur. All blood will be drawn from a person trained in phlebotomy. There will be no way to trace the blood back to the donor.

There are no known health risks for donating saliva or tongue scrapings from individuals who will be included in the study. There is a very minimal risk of linking individuals to the study. There will be no way to trace the saliva or tongue scrapings back to the donor.

Protections Against Risk Strategies for protection against risk. To protect privacy of participants and confidentiality of research data, no personal information regarding individual participants will be linked to the in vitro studies.

Plans for medical attention. In case of injury (which is extremely unlikely) as a result of saliva donation, the individuals will be instructed to contact their physician and medical care will be offered and charged to available research coverage maintained at Wake Forest School of Medicine.

In case of injury as a result of blood drawing, the patients will be instructed to contact their physician and medical care will be offered and charged to available research coverage maintained at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Blood drawn on the Reynolda campus is not a clinical setting, but blood will be drawn by trained phlebotomists with years of experience who maintain their training.

Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes will be promptly reported by the principal investigator or designated member of the research team to the IRB and sponsor or appropriate government agency if appropriate.

Incidental Findings. No incidental findings are expected to be discovered in this study as measures of bacterial nitrate reduction are not currently of clinical relevance so a strange, individual result in that measure would not be worth communicating.

Sample size assessment and statistical analysis

The investigators plan to enroll 10 participants who receive the probiotic and 10 participants who receive the placebo. The investigators hypothesize that, using a paired t-test, participants taking the probiotic will have significantly (P \< .05) lower change in plasma nitrite (post minus pre) at follow up compared to baseline while there will be no significant effect of the placebo (paired t-test).

The Investigators calculated that they would have 80% power to measure a 75% decrease in the change in nitrite at follow-up compared to baseline for the probiotic group with 10 participants per group (Continuous endpoint Two independent samples). The investigators assumed a 60% standard deviation in the change in nitrite for follow-up vs baseline based on previous data from our lab.",RECRUITING,,2024-06-01,2025-05,2025-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,20,ESTIMATED
NCT00954694,Analysis of the NuStep as an Introductory Fitness Regimen,Assessing the Impact of an Introductory Exercise Regimen: An Analysis of the Consequent Effects of NuStep in Relation to Physical Activity and Lifestyle Adjustment in Adults With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,"The purpose of this research study is to determine if participation in a fifteen week introductory exercise regimen using the NuStep by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes will affect exercise adherence and lifestyle adjustment. This study will examine if using the NuStep encourages participants to seek other modes and facilitates interest in exercise. Age, gender, weight, height, waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, and A1C will be recorded pre, mid-point, and post-test. During each NuStep exercise session heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose level, oxygen saturation, METs, and the Borg rate of perceived exertion will be monitored.

Associations between NuStep use and exercise adherence are investigated through the following hypothesis and null hypothesis. There is an association between using the NuStep as an introductory exercise regimen by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and exercise adherence. The null hypothesis states there is no association between using the NuStep as an introductory exercise regimen by sedentary adults diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and exercise adherence. The primary endpoint of the study is the qualitative measurement, by use of a questionnaire, of attitude and interest toward exercise in participants by assessing if they choose to seek and perform other modes of exercise. Secondary endpoints are the quantitative measurement of the change in weight, waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, blood pressure, 6-minute walk test, and A1C levels.",,UNKNOWN,,2009-08,2009-11,2009-11,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,PREVENTION,30,ESTIMATED
NCT06662994,High Dose Aflibercept in Diabetic Macular Edema in Patients With Previous Vitrectomy,High Dose Aflibercept in Diabetic Macular Edema in Patients With Previous Vitrectomy,"Patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) sometimes must undergo vitrectomy surgery (PPV) for diabetic and non-diabetic related issues. Patients may have improved DME with anti-VEGF therapy and ranibizumab has been found to reduce central macular thickness (CMT) with anti-VEGF therapy following vitrectomy. Those patients still require intravitreal injections but the pharmacokinetics of a vitrectomized eye are different than those eyes that have not undergone vitrectomy. The clearance of protein molecules is quicker in vitrectomized eyes so these patients may be more refractory to standard of care anti-VEGF therapy. In rabbit models, the half-life of both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were reduced by a factor 1.8 and 1.3, respectively, after pars plana vitrectomy. In a study examining intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in human eyes, the half-life was found to be 18.6 days in non-vitrectomized eyes and 3.2 days in vitrectomized eyes, but there was considerable intrasubject variation. Patients with various disease states, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have been managed with monthly anti-VEGF therapy successfully after vitrectomy surgery. Another study performed by the DRCR net showed that patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF are not affected in the long term if they had had a previous vitrectomy. High dose aflibercept may improve anatomic and visual outcomes in this patient population. Also, high dose aflibercept may allow for longer treatment intervals in these vitrectomized eyes.","Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and previous Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) will be treated with a treat-extend-stop (TES) protocol that was previously published. Below is the description of the TES protocol published in the International Journal of Retina and Vitreous. This protocol was originally used in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) but it is being adapted for treatment of patients with DME in this study.

Patients were treated following the treat-and-extend-stop (TES) protocol, which is a variant to the treat-and-extend regimen. The TES treatment protocol required 3 loading injections at 4-to-6-week treatment interval. Upon clinical examination and on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), dosing interval was extended by 1 to 2 weeks in patients with dry macula. Any evidence of fluid on OCT and decreased vision was carefully monitored. If fluid or worsening of vision was detected, the dosing interval was reduced. After successful management of patients following decreased interval, patients were allowed to increase interval by 1 week for the next 2 to 4 injections. In patients with good response without worsening vision, but exhibiting presence of mild fluid during the initial 4 to 6 week treatment interval, the same interval was maintained. In patients with complete absence of fluid in the macula, dosing interval was extended by 1 to 2 weeks. Extension of dosing interval continued until 12 weeks was reached between visits. To avoid recurrence of fluid, patients were monitored carefully once the 12-week interval was reached. Patients who experienced deterioration of vision or increase in metamorphopsia were instructed to contact the office for earlier return visit.

In this study, patients that have had a previous vitrectomy and have DME will be treated with high dose aflibercept until fluid has resolved and then the time interval in between treatments for those patients will be extended, while maintaining a fluid-free macula.

GDM is an important red flag: up to 70% women with GDM will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during their lifetime. Accordingly, professional associations recommend T2DM postpartum screening (T2DM-pP-S), 6-to-24 weeks after delivery. A 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be performed for diagnosis (gold standard). Nevertheless, this T2DM-pP-S recommendation has failed worldwide for the same reasons: the presently impractical pattern of the testing. A solution is direly needed.

Our overall goal is to improve detection of pre-diabetes and diabetes and more specifically, to facilitate the recommended T2DM-pP-S in women diagnosed with GDM.

We hypothesize that, in GDM women, results of an OGTT performed after delivery, before hospital discharge (OGTT-1) predict results of the recommended OGTT at 6-to-12 weeks postpartum (OGTT-2). Our aims are:

1. To validate in Caucasian women the predictive threshold value of the 2hr-glucose of OGTT-1 established by our Stage-1 study.
2. To determine, in a multiethnic non-Caucasian cohort, the threshold value for the 2hr-glucose of OGTT-1 that is predictive of abnormal glucose tolerance at OGTT-2.
3. To define the OGTT time preference of women (before hospital discharge vs. 6-to-12 weeks postpartum).

If our results are in line with our Stage-1 data, most redundant 6-to-24 weeks postpartum OGTT will be avoided. Medical practice will change.",,COMPLETED,,2014-12,2018-12-31,2017-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,228,ACTUAL

Results may provide evidence about the role of carbohydrate restriction in individuals with or at high risk of type 2 diabetes.,"In the short-term, among patients with type 2 diabetes, low-to-moderate carbohydrate diets have a greater glucose-lowering effect than do high-carbohydrate diets. However, compared with usual diet, the effect of a behavioral intervention promoting a low-carbohydrate/high-unsaturated fat and high-protein dietary pattern among individuals with prediabetes or untreated type 2 diabetes is not well understood.

The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to study the effect of a behavioral intervention promoting a low-carbohydrate/high-unsaturated fat and high-protein dietary pattern compared with usual diet on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic risk factors among individuals with or at high risk of diabetes (HbA1c 6.0-6.9%).

A total of 150 participants with HbA1c 6.0-6.9% will be recruited and randomly assigned to either a 6-month behavioral modification program designed to reduce carbohydrate intake (initial target \<40 g digestible carbohydrates, final target \<60 g digestible carbohydrates) or to usual diet in a 1:1 randomization ratio.

The primary outcome will be the difference between the active intervention and control groups for change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, total-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio, and body weight.

NCT04222660,Corneal Nerves Function and Structure,Diabetic Neuropathy: Function-Structure of Corneal Nerves to Assess Injury-Repair,"Peripheral neuropathy affects about 50% of the diabetic population and there is no treatment other than good blood glucose control, which is ineffective in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Part of the problem for the lack of an effective treatment is the inability to detect peripheral neuropathy in its early stage. The hypotheses to be addressed in the first phase of this study is that changes in cornea sensitivity (blinking and squinting) following addition of a hyperosmotic solution will provide a novel screening tool for early diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. For the second phase of the study the investigators will examine the effect of fish oil treatment of diabetic subjects with neuropathy on corneal nerve density and sensitivity. Corneal nerves are the most highly innervated part of the human body with great sensitivity. The first phase will use this property and determine whether sensitivity is lost in diabetic patients with neuropathy. Preclinical studies have supported this hypothesis and now this will be tested in human subjects. Preclinical studies have also shown that treating diabetic rodents with fish oil improves nerve regeneration and outcome measures of peripheral in diabetic rodents. In the second phase the investigators will perform preliminary studies in human subjects with diabetic neuropathy and determine whether treating them with fish oil increases corneal nerve density and sensitivity.","Recruitment has been suspended because of the COVID-19 crisis and the Iowa City VA is just beginning to have face to face appointments.

The hypotheses to be studied in the following specific aims is that changes in cornea sensitivity to a hyperosmotic solution will provide a novel screening tool for early diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The investigators also propose that clinical feasibility studies will demonstrate that treatment with fish oil will improve outcome measures of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Specific aims:

1. Determine if the reflex squinting and blinking response to the application of a hyperosmotic solution to the cornea is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without peripheral neuropathy.

   a. Determine whether changes in corneal sensitivity correlate with loss of cornea nerves in the sub-epithelial layer of the cornea and symptom scores for PN.
2. Determine if treating human subjects with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy with an oral fish oil supplement increases circulating levels of resolvin D1, restores cornea sensitivity to a hyperosmotic eye drop challenge and improves corneal nerve density and symptom scores for peripheral neuropathy.

For this first phase the investigators will enroll 75 subjects to participate (Fifty subjects with type 2 diabetes; 25 with clinically detectable peripheral neuropathy and 25 without neuropathy will be enrolled as well as 25 age-matched control subjects). In the second phase of the study the investigators will investigate whether increased intake of fish oil improves diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Subjects will receive 4g (2g twice a day) of fish oil per day in capsule form.

The investigators first introduced fish oil as a successful treatment of peripheral neuropathy in pre-clinical studies with diabetic rodents and will now expand those studies , culminating in this feasibility study of treatment using human subjects with type 2 diabetes and neuropathy. In this study non diabetic subjects (control) and subjects with type 2 diabetes with mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy will be recruited from phase 1 of this study to participate in the phase 2 treatment phase of the study. A baseline determination of their neuropathy (Subjective Peripheral Neuropathy Screen Questionnaire) including evaluation of corneal nerve structure and sensitivity and blood sample will be performed. Tests besides the questionnaire to be used to screen the subjects for peripheral neuropathy will include 10 g mono filament, vibration threshold, ankle reflex and sensitivity to warm and cold stimulus. Subjects will then be instructed to take 2 fish oil capsules twice a day. Subjects will return at 4, 8 and 12 months for re-evaluation. If successful, the feasibility study will provide a proof of concept to advance fish oils to a larger clinical trial for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Visual acuity (subject's vision) will be measured by having the subject read the smallest letters on an eye chart with their glasses or best correction. This takes about 5 minutes or less.

Slit lamp examination: A standard slit lamp examination will be performed to insure that no exclusion criteria are present and no corneal abrasion is present.

The corneal sensitivity procedure will consist of applying a drop of 5% Muro 128 to the eye and recording the blinking and squinting response over the next 5 minutes. Based on preclinical studies it is anticipated that normal subjects will have an increased blinking and squinting response seconds after the addition of the hyperosmotic solution (5% Muro 128), whereas diabetic subjects with neuropathy will have a attenuated response.

Corneal sensation threshold: Corneal sensation will also be measured in each eye using a handheld Luneau Cochet -Bonnet aesthesiometer. This device contains a thin, retractable, nylon monofilament in which the length (stiffness) is varied between 6.0 mm and 1.0 mm until the subject can detect the touch on their central cornea, resulting in a blink reflex. In each eye, testing will begin with the 6.0 mm filament, after which the length will be progressively shortened by 0.5 mm until the patient reports sensing the corneal contact. Each eye will be tested three times and the best performance (in terms of longest filament that is perceived to touch the cornea) will be recorded as the corneal sensation threshold.

Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT):

The thickness of the optic nerve and macula will also be measured inside of the eye using a special camera that forms an image of the layers of the retina. The imaging is harmless and measures the thickness or structural health of retinal layers and optic nerve. A new feature of OCT is eye-tracking. Eye tracking does not take any longer since it is done simultaneously with the imaging. Eye tracking during OCT may give us new insight into some eye disorders. This test takes approximately 10 minutes.

A hand-held pupillometer/electroretinogram device (RETeval, LKC) will be held in front of the subject s eye, but will not touch the eye. The device will provide a brief, a series of brief light stimuli and then record the pupil response and the elicited electrical response from the retina from a surface skin patch (electrode) placed below each eye, from the light as a measure of whether the inherent sensitivity of the eye in the retina is normal. The investigators will repeat this in the left eye. The visible light stimulus is safe and is given at an intensity experienced in normal daily light exposures. The test takes about 2 minutes per eye.",COMPLETED,,2021-06-21,2025-05-13,2023-06-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,BASIC_SCIENCE,44,ACTUAL

NCT00205660,"Changes in Adiposity, Metabolic Measures From Atypicals to Aripiprazole",Changes in Adiposity and Metabolic Measures During Medication Switches to Aripiprazole From Other Atypical Antipsychotics,"This proposal aims to use well-validated methodologies such as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests (fsOGTTs), and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps to characterize the metabolic effects of 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment following chronic pretreatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone.

We hypothesize that switching to aripiprazole treatment will induce improvements in total body adiposity, inflammation (e.g., high sensitivity C-reactive protein \[hsCRP\]), glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin sensitivity) and lipid metabolism (e.g., fasting plasma triglyceride), in comparison to chronic pretreatment with olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine.","Schizophrenia is associated with increased rates of obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), causing increased morbidity and mortality due to acute (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) and long-term (e.g., vascular disease) complications.1-5As a result, cardiovascular (CV) mortality remains one of the leading causes of excess mortality in patients with psychotic disorders.6,7 T2DM is characterized by disturbances in insulin secretion and insulin action at skeletal muscle (i.e., decreased glucose disposal), liver (i.e., increased glucose production) and adipose tissue (i.e., increased lipolysis), leading to disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism. The metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and abdominal adiposity usually includes a procoagulant state and endothelial dysfunction, and is strongly associated with increased CV morbidity and mortality.

Hyperglycemia was first noted in patients with schizophrenia prior to the introduction of antipsychotic medications, but glucoregulatory defects, dyslipidemia and increased adiposity are all additionally associated with both older and newer antipsychotic treatments.1 In most patients, these metabolic derangements are primarily related to increases in adiposity, although treatment effects independent of adiposity may also play a role in up to 25% of cases of new onset T2DM during antipsychotic treatment.8,9 Increased adiposity, especially visceral abdominal adiposity, is associated with insulin resistance, elevated plasma lipids, and increases in inflammatory markers. All of these conditions contribute to elevated mortality and all can be directly measured in patients treated with different medications.

Direct measures of adiposity, insulin action and secretion, plasma lipid levels and inflammation are available and have been well validated as predictors of CV disease and T2DM complications. Unfortunately, to date, studies using large population-based samples of patients taking antipsychotic medications have only used insensitive measures, like random glucose, or surrogate measures such as prescription of an oral hypoglycemic agent, to estimate the prevalence of T2DM during antipsychotic treatment. No data are available concerning insulin sensitivity and secretion, plasma lipids or inflammatory markers from large population-based samples of individuals treated with antipsychotic medications. Reviewed below, limited data are available from smaller analytic studies using sensitive measures. Despite convergent evidence for the contribution of adiposity to the metabolic derangements associated with antipsychotic treatment, investigators have only begun to use direct measures of adiposity to characterize the weight gain associated with antipsychotic treatment.

This proposal aims to use well-validated methodologies such as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests (fsOGTTs), and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps to characterize the metabolic effects of 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment following chronic pretreatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone.

We hypothesize that switching to aripiprazole treatment will induce improvements in total body adiposity, inflammation (e.g., high sensitivity C-reactive protein \[hsCRP\]), glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin sensitivity) and lipid metabolism (e.g., fasting plasma triglyceride), in comparison to chronic pretreatment with olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine.

Aim 1: To characterize the glucoregulatory effects of 12 weeks of aripiprazole treatment.

This study hypothesizes that switching to aripiprazole treatment will be associated with statistically significant improvements in glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin sensitivity) in comparison to chronic pretreatment with olanzapine. Given the planned sample size and study duration, we hypothesize that aripiprazole treatment will be associated with numerical, but not statistically significant, improvements in comparison to pretreatment with risperidone or quetiapine. We hypothesize that aripiprazole treatment will be associated with no significant change in comparison to pretreatment with ziprasidone. These hypotheses will be evaluated by measuring insulin sensitivity and other indices via fsOGTTs and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps.

Aim 2: To evaluate medication-related measures of abdominal fat, total body fat and total fat-free mass.

This study hypothesizes that switching to aripiprazole treatment will be associated with reductions in adipose tissue mass in comparison to olanzapine. We hypothesize that aripiprazole treatment will be associated with numerical, but not statistically significant, reductions in comparison to pretreatment with risperidone or quetiapine. We hypothesize that aripiprazole treatment will be associated with no change in comparison to pretreatment with ziprasidone. These hypotheses will be evaluated by measuring body composition using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and anthropomorphic measurements to provide estimates of total body fat, abdominal fat and fat-free mass.",COMPLETED,,2005-02,2009-08,2009-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,51,ACTUAL

NCT01712594,Safety and Effectiveness Study of a Closed Loop System Maintaining Patients' Glucose Levels During an Overnight Period,Feasibility and Safety of a Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System (Aka AAGC) With an Artificially Induced Calibration Error During the Overnight Period,"Currently, patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes rely on either finger stick or sensor glucose readings when making their insulin dosage decisions. Designing a computerized system that mimics the way insulin is produced naturally in a person who does not have type 1 diabetes holds many challenges; all of which cannot be addressed in just one study. The purpose of the Medtronic Overnight Closed Loop study is to assess the performance of a system designed to automatically infuse the correct insulin dose during the hours that the patient is sleeping.

The system consists of an insulin pump that provides insulin to the patient through an infusion set. A sensor inserted just under the patient's skin measures glucose levels and a transmitter sends this information to the pump. To enable the sensor to register the glucose information correctly, it must be set (calibrated) by a finger stick blood glucose 3-4 times a day. In the commercially released system, the physician would recommend the continuous background (basal) insulin rates and the patient would be required to make decisions regarding extra insulin (bolus) for meals or as a response to high glucose levels.

In the Closed Loop System, a mobile control system is added to these devices. This consists of an Android phone, a closed loop algorithm and a translator. This system is designed to translate the sensor information and direct the pump to provide the required dosage of insulin automatically without requiring input from the patient.

Reliable calibration has proved challenging, and so it is important that the system function safely, even when calibration is inaccurate. In this study, a calibration error will be introduced under very controlled circumstances. This testing will identify if the system can maintain acceptable overnight glucose levels, regardless of whether or not calibration is ideal.",,COMPLETED,,2013-05,2014-12,2013-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,TREATMENT,9,ACTUAL
NCT00264394,Cardiovascular Risk Factor Management in HIV Infection,Efficacy of a Computerised Physician Reminder System to Control Cardiovascular Risk Factors in HIV-infected Patients Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy: A Nested Randomised Controlled Cluster Trial Within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study,"There is growing evidence that antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) through metabolic side effects, such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. Prevalence of risk factors for CHD in HIV-infected individuals receiving ART in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) is high. This cluster randomised controlled trial is nested into the SHCS and will investigate whether physicians randomised to the routine provision of risk profiles from their patients receiving ART will improve the management of risk factors in HIV-infected patients compared to control physicians not routinely receiving such information. Risk profiles will be generated by the SHCS data center and provided to clinicians in all study centers.","Evidence from the D.A.D. study, an international cohort study which includes a large proportion of SHCS patients, suggests that exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) most likely due to ART induced metabolic changes like dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. The exact mechanisms for these metabolic changes and whether specific classes or combinations of ART are causally related to these changes are not known. Of males aged \< 40 and \> 40 years in the SHCS, 8.8% and 32.5% are at moderate (10% - 20%) and 1.7% and 6.9% at high (≥ 20%) risk of CHD in 10 years according to the Framingham algorithm. The overall percentage at moderate and high 10-year risk of CHD was 14.9% and 3.0%, respectively. Therefore, an intervention to reduce CHD risk among individuals at high risk for CHD is warranted. We propose a randomised controlled cluster intervention trial to reduce total cholesterol in all HIV-infected individuals in the SHCS (primary endpoint) and in those with greater than or equal to 10% 10 year risk of CHD based on the Framingham score (secondary endpoint). The intervention is the receipt of structured continuously updated information on CHD risk factors and treatment of CHD risk factors of HIV-infected patients. Randomisation will be done at the physician level and stratified by centre (7 centres of the SHCS, outpatient clinic or hospital), and size of patient volume for registered private practices. For physicians randomised to the intervention group, a flow sheet with information on risk factors and treatment status of CHD will be provided for each of their patients every 6 months by the SHCS data centre. Each centre and each physician treating SHCS patients will receive internationally and locally approved guidelines for the management of risk factors for CHD in HIV-infected patients. The intervention will be limited to 18 months. Our goal is a 7% reduction in total cholesterol (primary endpoint) between the intervention and the control group in the entire cohort. With alfa-error of 5%, power of 80% and a loss to follow-up of 10%, 408 patients per arm will be needed. Sample size calculations adapted to the cluster design of the trial show that we have sufficient power to detect a 12% reduction in total cholesterol in patients receiving ART and at moderate to high risk of CHD.

NCT06526494,Metformin and Vascular Function in Prediabetes,Metformin and Vascular Function in Prediabetes,"The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate whether metformin improves vascular function in individuals with prediabetes. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does metformin improve large conduit artery endothelial function in individuals with prediabetes?
2. Does metformin improve microvascular endothelial function in individuals with prediabetes?

Researchers will compare metformin to a placebo to see if metformin improves vascular function in prediabetes.

The trial duration is 12 weeks. Participants will take metformin or a placebo once a day for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, participants will take metformin or a placebo twice a day for the remaining 10 weeks. There will be a screening visit, two baseline visits, a 4-week safety visit, and two 12-week end-of-study visits. Adherence will be calculated from pill count and adverse events will be quantified via a questionnaire.","Prediabetes affects approximately 98 million people in the United States and significantly elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and progression to type-2 diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, is a key subclinical risk factor contributing to the increased CVD risk in prediabetes. Additionally, endothelial dysfunction exacerbates insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, further elevating the likelihood of progression to overt diabetes. Thus, targeting endothelial dysfunction in prediabetes presents a strategic opportunity to mitigate the risks of both CVD and overt diabetes.

Hyperglycemia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation reduces nitric oxide bioavailability, driving endothelial dysfunction in prediabetes. Therefore, interventions that lower hyperglycemia could decrease ROS production, enhance nitric oxide bioavailability, and improve endothelial function in prediabetes. Metformin, a first-line anti-diabetic agent, lowers hyperglycemia by reducing hepatic glucose output and enhancing insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Despite its established vascular benefits in diabetes, the effects of metformin on endothelial function in prediabetes remain unexplored.

This study will enroll 30 individuals in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial utilizing innovative methodologies to elucidate the vascular benefits of metformin in prediabetes. Specifically, the investigators will assess 1) large conduit artery endothelial function, and 2) cutaneous microvascular endothelial function in prediabetes. By investigating these mechanisms, the investigators aim to provide critical insights into metformin's potential to reduce CVD risk and prevent the progression to diabetes in individuals with prediabetes.",RECRUITING,,2024-11-13,2026-10-01,2026-10-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,30,ESTIMATED

The investigators will carry out separate population based cohort studies using administrative health databases in six jurisdictions in Canada, the US, and the UK. Cohorts will be defined by the initiation of a new anti-diabetic drug when incretin-based drugs entered the market, with follow-up until hospitalization for AP. The results from the separate sites will be combined to provide an overall assessment of the risk of AP in users of incretin-based drugs and by class of incretin-based drugs.","The study objective is to determine whether the use of incretin-based drugs, compared with the use of oral anti-diabetic drug combinations, is associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis (AP) in routine clinical practice. A common-protocol approach will be used to conduct retrospective cohort studies using administrative health care data from six jurisdictions (the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, as well as United States (US) MarketScan and the United Kingdom (UK) Clinical Practice Research Datalink \[CPRD\]). Briefly, the Canadian databases include population-level data on physician billing, diagnoses and procedures from hospital discharge abstracts, and dispensations for prescription drugs. Ontario data will be restricted to patients aged 65 years and older as prescription data are not available for younger patients. The CPRD is a clinical database that is representative of the UK population and contains the records for patients seen at over 680 general practitioner practices in the UK; these data will be linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database, which contains in-hospital diagnosis and procedure data. US MarketScan includes individuals and their dependents covered by large U.S. employer health insurance plans, and government and public organizations.

Study population

In each jurisdiction, the investigators will assemble a base cohort that includes all patients with a first-ever prescription for a non-insulin anti-diabetic drug, including biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogs, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides or combinations of these drugs from the earliest availability of data at each site to the last date of availability of data. The date of prescription (for the CPRD) or dispensation (for all other sites) of the first-ever non-insulin anti-diabetic drug will define the date of base cohort entry. From this base cohort, a study cohort will be created including all patients who initiated a new anti-diabetic drug class during the year in which incretin-based drugs entered the market in each jurisdiction or any time thereafter. These new users consist of both those who are newly-treated for diabetes, as well as those who switch to or add on a new anti-diabetic drug class not included as part of their previous treatment history. The date of study cohort entry is defined by the prescription date of the newly-prescribed drug class. Patients in the study cohort will be followed from the date of study cohort entry until an event (defined below) or censoring due to death, departure from the database, loss of continuous health plan or drug plan enrolment, entry into a long-term care facility, an incident diagnosis of HIV or new prescription of HAART, or the end of the study period (June 30, 2014 or the last date of data availability at that site), whichever occurs first.

Case-control selection

The cohort defined above will be analyzed using a nested case-control analysis, where cases are defined as a hospitalization for AP. Risk set sampling will be used to randomly select up to 20 controls for each case, matched on sex, age (± 365 days), date of study cohort entry (± 180 days), duration of treated diabetes (± 90 days), and duration of follow-up in days.

Exposure assessment

Current exposure to an anti-diabetic drug will be defined as any prescription whose duration plus a 30-day grace period overlaps the index or event date. Current exposure will be classified hierarchically based on the following five mutually-exclusive categories: 1) incretin-based drugs; 2) insulin; 3) ≥2 oral anti-diabetic drugs used in combination therapy; 4) oral anti-diabetic drug monotherapy; and 5) no current exposure to an anti-diabetic drug. Oral anti-diabetic drugs used in combination will serve as the primary reference category as incretin-based drugs are second- to third-line therapy and thus used at a comparable point in the disease management.

Statistical analyses

Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association of hospitalization for AP, comparing incretin-based drugs to current use of oral anti-diabetic drug combinations. This is considered the primary analysis. Secondary analyses will include sub-classifying current users of incretin-based drugs by type (i.e., DPP-4 inhibitor vs GLP-1 analog) and duration of current use (≤ 365 days, 366-729 days, and ≥730 days). The potential presence of effect modification by history of acute pancreatitis will also be examined. In addition, seven sensitivity analyses will be conducted; all defined a priori, to assess the robustness of the results. Finally, all site-specific estimates will be meta-analyzed using random-effects models with inverse variance weighting, with fixed-effects analyses conducted as sensitivity analyses. The amount of between-site heterogeneity will be estimated using the I square statistic.",COMPLETED,,2014-03,2015-04,2015-04,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1417914,ACTUAL
NCT06560060,Do People With Complications of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Have a Different Microbiome (MARVEL),Is the Gut Microbiome Associated With Residual Β-Cell Function and DeVElopment of Complications in Individuals With Longstanding Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (MARVEL),"This study looks at whether people with type 1 diabetes have different gut bacteria. We also want to see if this is linked to keeping insulin production up and preventing complications like heart disease and nerve damage. The aim is to find ways to keep more of the functions working, avoid low blood sugar and reduce diabetes complications.","Rationale: It has become apparent that most individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) have some remaining β-cell function. Individuals with T1D and a preserved β-cell function have a lower risk of hypoglycemia and diabetic complications. The factors regulating residual β-cell function are unknown. A likely mechanism leading to β-cell preservation is regulation of immunological tone by the gut microbiome. Recently we published in a small pilot cohort (GUTDM1, METC 2020_105) that residual β-cell function is linked to better glycemic control (time in range) and linked to specific gut microbiota composition. Since this cohort was too small to also show a link with presence of diabetic complications and recruit enough individuals with preserved β-cell function for confirmatory intervention trials to increase β-cell function, we will now aim to recruit a larger follow-up cohort. The aim of this cohort is to a) investigate whether residual β-cell function is associated with gut microbiome composition and circulating immune cell counts in individuals with T1D and diabetic complications b) identify 500 potential eligible individuals with preserved β-cell function for future intervention trials.

Objective:

1. To investigate whether T1D individuals with preserved β-cell function exhibit a distinct gut microbial and circulating immune cell signature, leading to a reduced incidence of diabetes complications (CVD, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy).
2. Identify individuals with preserved β-cell function for diagnostics as well as future intervention studies to increase β-cell function.

Study design: 10-year longitudinal observational multicenter cohort study

Study population: 5000 individuals with type 1 diabetes \>18 years of age, visiting the outpatient clinic of Diabeter center Amsterdam and Diabeter Nederland.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is long-term residual β-cell function as assessed by baseline and stimulated 2-hour post meal urinary C-peptide levels at 3,6 and 10 years follow-up. The secondary endpoint pertains presence and incidence of diabetes complications (cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy), gut microbiota composition measured in feces with shotgun sequencing, glucose time-in-range (CGM-metrics) and subsequent exogenous insulin dose. Tertiary endpoints include the profiling of immune cell subsets, assessment of autoreactive T lymphocytes and HLA typing by high resolution sequencing of circulating leukocytes (IMMOCHIP) in relation to untargeted plasma metabolomics (Metabolon).

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: This study is considered a negligible-risk study. The patient will complete several questionnaires, keep track of a food diary and collect urine and feces prior to the baseline study visit. At the study visit we will require a fasted plasma sample, this will slightly increase the chances of a hypoglycemic episode, largely mitigated because all participants carry a continues glucose monitor. Additionally, we will calculate BMI, waist circumference, liver stiffness and measure blood pressure. The questionnaires inquire about the burden of diabetic complications, socio-economic status and financial literacy, abdominal complaints and hypoglycemic episodes, and comorbidities associated with diabetes, quality of life and psychological functioning. We argue that the risk and discomfort associated with this study is similar to the yearly diabetes check-up and justified in light of the potentially profound insights and novel treatments to be gained by studying the impact of the gut microbiome on residual β-cell function in T1D.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-09-01,2043-10,2043-10-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,5000,ESTIMATED

Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) measurement is recommended for the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and polydipsia. However, AVP measurement is cumbersome. AVP is derived from a larger precursor peptide along with copeptin, which is a more stable peptide directly mirroring the production of AVP. Copeptin can be assayed readily in plasma.

Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin levels in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.

Design: Prospective, observational multicenter study.

Setting: Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital of Basel

Patients: Patients with suspected or known central (complete or partial), nephrogenic (complete or partial) or psychogenic diabetes insipidus undergoing a standardized water deprivation test.

Intervention: All patients with suspected or known diabetes insipidus will undergo an overnight water deprivation test and a standardized water deprivation test, as routinely performed in the diagnostic evaluation of diabetes insipidus. Plasma AVP and copeptin will be measured at baseline (8 am before start of thirsting), and hourly during the water deprivation test.

Study hypothesis: Copeptin levels will provide a better diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus as compared to AVP measurement.

Analysis: We will study 5 groups of patients: A) Patients with complete central diabetes insipidus, B) Patients with partial central diabetes insipidus, C) Patients with complete nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, D) Patients with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and E) Patients with psychogenic diabetes insipidus.

This results in a power of 90% to detect a difference in copeptin levels of 0.8pmol/L between the closest two groups, i.e. patients with partial central Diabetes insipidus and patients with psychogenic Diabetes insipidus.

Significance: The measurement of copeptin will allow a better discrimination of patients with diabetes insipidus, especially for the discrimination of partial central and nephrogenic and psychogenic diabetes insipidus.",COMPLETED,,2008-06,2014-10,2014-10,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,50,ACTUAL

One of the most important complications of DM is nephropathy.

Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenolic compound belongs to the large group of polyphenols found in different plant species. The richest natural source of resveratrol is Polygonum cuspidatum - a plant root extract of which have been used in oriental folk medicine. Considerable amounts of resveratrol were also found in skin of red grapes, peanuts, groundnuts, and red vine.

Resveratrol is considered to have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, the cardiovascular system, as it has been found to improve vasodilatation, ischaemic preconditioning, both of which seem to be the result of the activation of the endothelial NO synthase enzyme, and to inhibit both platelet aggregation and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Resveratrol itself is an efficient antioxidant, as evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo studies, and, it has also been shown to improve diabetes-related impairments in animals.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

NCT06283394,Penn Medicine Food Market Study,AHA (American Heart Association) Health Care x Food Penn Medicine Food Market Study,"The goal of this interventional study is to test ways to improve the effectiveness of a healthy foods prescription program in increasing the purchase of healthy foods for patients who have both obesity (BMI \>or= 30) and diabetes (last A1C\>8 in the 90 days from data pull). The main questions it aims to answer are:

Aim 1: Examine feasibility and engagement among participants by assessing percent enrollment among those identified as eligible, rates of Instacart platform use, amount of the subsidy used each week, and amounts of healthy foods ordered.

Aim 2: Examine strategies to optimize the user experience of trial participation, including communication strategies and on-boarding, to increase uptake and engagement in this and subsequent studies.

Usual Care (Control): Participants in the usual care arm will not receive weekly subsidies on Instacart, and they will not receive any modifications to the virtual storefront on Instacart. They will have access to the standard Instacart platform and Instacart + memberships with $5 per week to cover service and delivery fees and delivery tips for 3 months.

Intervention Arms: The four treatment groups will also each receive a $160 subsidy per month for 3 months to be used on produce (fruits and vegetables).","Patients who have both obesity (BMI \>or= 30) and diabetes (last A1C\>8 in the 90 days from time of data pull) will be recruited from specific Penn Medicine primary care practices. This patient list is curated based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Participants in the control group will receive usual care (defined as access to the the virtual storefront without the choice architecture manipulation) but all study participants will receive a free Instacart+ membership for the 3 months they are a study participant and be given $20 per month to help cover the cost of additional delivery and service fees as well as tips for delivery drivers on Instacart. Participants in the intervention groups will in addition receive $160 per month in subsidies on Instacart. All arms will receive text messages and/or email messages from W2H 1x per week with a link to Instacart and different messaging depending on the study arm.

The main difference between the pilot intervention and the main RCT is the length (2 weeks for the pilot, 3 months for the main RCT); otherwise, they will receive the same experience. The pilot phase intends to test out a mini version of the full intervention and get participant feedback so that the study team can improve the user experience before conducting the main intervention study.

Participants in 4 of the 5 study arms will be given vouchers for use on Instacart to buy fruit and vegetables ($160 a month). They will be given an individualized link to a special study website that is an Instacart virtual store where they can order food items to be delivered. Weekly, Instacart will send us data on how much is left in terms of unexpended vouchers and what food is purchased for each study ID each month.

Initial Feasibility Test (2 Weeks): Before enrolling participants in this phase of the study, the study team will examine strategies for uptake and engagement through one rapid 10-person studies followed by semi-structured interviews to gather feedback on ways to improve the user experience. There will be a cohort of 10 participants randomized 2 in each of the 5 study arms. Each interview will be audio-recorded with permission from the participant and subsequently transcribed for analysis. Interviews will take place over the phone or on Zoom and will be recorded using an audio recorder. Audio files will be uploaded to a third-party professional transcription service, which will transcribe the recordings and send us the transcripts for analysis. Participants that sign up for their Instacart account within 48 hours will receive a $25 Instacart gift card. All participants in the intervention arms during this phase will receive $40 per week for two weeks to be used to subsidize the purchase of foods on the healthy foods list (denoted by Instacart on the virtual storefront). Participants in the control arm will receive $5 per week for two weeks to cover additional service fees, delivery fees, and driver tips. This will be done twice to reach high rates of initial enrollment and ongoing engagement. This will also test the integration of our trial platform (W2H), connection to Instacart, and receipt of data from Instacart at the individual level. These iterative studies will be used to get participant input into the user experience and to streamline our on-boarding processes. Participants will also receive $50 to debrief with the study team on their experience.

Randomized Controlled Trial (3 Months): The study team then plans to test modifying choice architecture and different ways of presenting incentives to affect the degree to which these strategies change healthy food purchasing behavior.

All participants will start in the study at the beginning of the month. If they do not complete their enrollment by the 5th day of the month, they will be paused until the 1st business day of the following month.

In the RCT phase, participants will be reached out to by text and sent to a Way to Health study link where they will be asked to first complete a brief eligibility survey via text message. Eligibility questions include whether the participant is comfortable online shopping and if they have a backup payment method for foods they purchase over and above the value of the subsidies.

Participants will complete dietary recall questionnaires at 0 and 3 months via W2H. The study team will use the Diet.ID validated a two-minute dietary assessment tool (https://www.dietid.com/). As part of the 3-month assessment, participants will be asked questions about their study experience. Participants will be compensated $25 for completing instacart sign up within 48 hours, $25 for the baseline dietary survey and $25 for completing the 3-month dietary survey and exit survey and $50 for completing a hemoglobin A1c lab after 3 months.

At the completion of the 3-month study period, a subset of participants (total of 42, selecting those with highest and lowest % of fruit and vegetable voucher use each month) will be invited to complete semi-structured exit interviews conducted by a trained research coordinator over the phone or through Zoom.

NCT04670094,Comorbidities and Risk Score in COVID-19 Patients,Comorbidities and Risk Score for Severity and Outcome in Patients With Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,Retrospective multi-center cohort study. Consecutive patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) up to October 2020 will be included. Patients are followed until discharge from hospital or death.,"Background

A virus causing clusters of severe pneumonia was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

This pathogen was designated as SARS-CoV-2. Although of probable zoonotic origin, human-to-human transmission has rapidly fuelled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally.

On February 20th, the first case of locally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in Northern Italy in a critically ill, hospitalized young man with no travel history to known areas of viral circulation or link to a probable or confirmed coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) case. Prior to this date, only three cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Central Italy, all with a travel history to Wuhan. Following this unexpected finding, case counts, and death tolls has increased rapidly in the country with a total of 192,994 confirmed cases and 25,969 deaths as of 24 April 2020.

Study rationale

Multiple variables have been described as possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, severity and prognosis, among which age, sex and comorbidities play an important role.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed the underlying medical conditions that have shown to increase the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2. While some comorbidities, such as serious heart conditions and chronic kidney disease have a consistent and strong evidence as bad prognostic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection, others as HIV have a limited evidence and heterogeneous results.

Further, despite it is well-known that the burden of co-existing diseases may be additive or even multiplicative, the effect of specific disease cluster on COVID-19 adverse outcomes has never been evaluated. Finally, the proposed models and risk scores currently available to predict disease severity and mortality are poorly reported and at high risk of bias, raising concern that their predictions could be unreliable when applied in daily practice. A reliable risk/prognostic score developed by a multidimensional and cross-validated approach will pave the way for future research on frail sectors of the population and on the use of health system resources. At the clinical level, a prognostic score will allow to predict severity and mortality risk in patients requiring hospitalization and to stratify patients according to clinical severity helping clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will confirm risk predictors already known and provide evidence for the uncertain ones. The investigators will also develop a prognostic score able to predict negative clinical outcomes (primarily short-term mortality), that will be useful to stratify patients at hospital admission according to their different risk profiles, and therefore to ""tailor"" the individuals' level of care.

A secondary objective could be that to extend this approach at the susceptible population level, especially the elders, to stratify according to the higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized and to have a dismal outcome (not developed here but related to a possible amendment).

Sample size

The investigators expect the total number of patients with complete data to be approximately 2500, based on the expected recruitment of each center.

Analysis Plan

Data will be summarized by counts and percentage and quartiles for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multi-state models will be used to describe patient's hospital mortality and discharge. In-hospital mortality will be estimate accounting for discharge as competing event. Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate mortality up to 3-months from admission. The role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome will be evaluated by the Cox model adjusting for relevant confounders. A clinically-based prognostic score will be developed including comorbidities and other risk factors. The score will be constructed by a multidimensional approach and Lasso approach will be used to select relevant risk factors. The Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) and Brier score will be used to evaluate model performance and the final score will be cross-validated. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a training and test validation approach. The use of regression trees for a practical definition of risk subgroups and latent variable models will also be considered.

Multiple imputation will be performed if missing would exceed 10%.

Data collection

Consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 up to October 2020 will be included. Given the difficulty in systematically obtaining written informed consent and given the great public interest of the project, the research will be conducted in the context of the authorizations guaranteed by Article 89 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU Regulation 2016/679, which guarantees processing for purposes of public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes of health data.",COMPLETED,,2020-12-30,2021-05-29,2021-05-29,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,4555,ACTUAL

We will conduct experiments in normal subjects to address these questions.","Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the progressive loss of pancreatic insulin-secreting beta-cells. This consequently leads to a lack of insulin and elevation of blood sugar, namely hyperglycemia, which is a major cause for the development of diabetes and its acute or chronic complications. The current treatment for type 1 diabetes requires a life-long dependency on daily insulin injections, causing inconvenience and burden to patients. Drug-induced hypoglycemia is also common as it presents a major challenge in insulin therapy. Furthermore, although insulin therapy is lifesaving, it is not a cure as it neither reverses the progression of the disease nor prevents the development of serious complications associated with this disease. New treatments are urgently needed.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a natural chemical found in the brain, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is also produced in large quantities by pancreatic beta-cells, has beta-cell regenerative and immunoregulatory effects. Importantly, GABA prevented and partially reversed diabetes in type 1 diabetes mouse models. It is important to address essential questions regarding the potential effects of GABA in diabetic patients in humans. Given the largely unknown mechanism of action of GABA in the pancreas, and the limited information on how GABA is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the human body, we plan to examine these issues (referred to as pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) in normal subjects.

This study will determine whether treating pregnant women who have mild GDM improves the health of their babies. The follow-up study will examine whether factors during the previous pregnancy (such as blood sugar during pregnancy) are associated with the woman and her child's health 4-9 years later.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus is defined as glucose intolerance of variable severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. The definition applies regardless of insulin use for treatment or the persistence of the condition after pregnancy, and does not exclude the possibility that unrecognized glucose intolerance or overt diabetes may have preceded the pregnancy. Pre-existing diabetes substantially contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality. The association of milder forms of gestational diabetes with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including morbidities such as macrosomia, birth trauma, and neonatal hypoglycemia, remains questionable. While it is likely that maternal glucose intolerances reflect a continuum of risk for adverse outcomes, it is not known whether there is a benefit to identification and subsequent treatment of mild glucose intolerance during pregnancy. This study will determine whether dietary treatment (and insulin as required) for mild GDM will reduce the frequency of neonatal morbidity associated with mild glucose intolerance.

Participants in this study will receive a 50-gram glucose loading test (GLT) between 24 and 30 weeks' gestation. Those with a positive GLT will receive a subsequent 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Based upon these test results, women will be assigned to 4 groups.

To correlate the levels of serum Cathepsin S and chromogranin A with HbA1c and eGFR in type 2 diabetic patients based on urinary Albumin- Creatinine Ratio.","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and serious complication of diabetes and has been shown to be a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring costly renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation .

It is appreciated that up to 40% of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) present DN . Early detection and appropriate treatment are essential to prevent disability and death.

Cathepsin S (Cat-S) was a secreted cysteine proteolytic enzyme that is mainly expressed in macrophages. Macrophages undergoing chemotaxis adhere to the basement membrane of blood vessels and secrete Cat-S, and the secreted Cat-S was involved in hydrolysis of elastin, laminin, collagen and other extracellular matrix components, causing vascular damage .

So, Cathepsin S(Cat-S), a novel non-invasive diagnostic marker mediates vascular endothelial dysfunction.

In recent years, studies have shown that up regulation of Cat-S was associated with the development of IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, insulin resistance, diabetes and other renal diseases.

In the literature, motor imagery is seen as a window opening to cognitive motor processes and especially motor control. Motor imagery is negatively affected in many diseases that affect the brain and brain functions, such as stroke, Parkinson, and multiple sclerosis, and motor imagery is frequently used in the rehabilitation of these diseases. Poor glycemic control in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus leads to deterioration in brain and cognitive functions. However, no study has been found on the effects of these disorders seen in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus on MI skills. Motor imagery is a mental practice that is becoming widespread in many areas. However, before considering using Motor imagery-based exercises as a therapy tool for patients, it is important to consider the extent to which patients cognitive impairments are related to their ability to form accurate motor images. For example, studies have found that patients with the lack of body awareness may not be able to produce kinesthetic images of motor movements.

Body awareness is the tendency to pay attention to internal bodily sensations and stimuli and includes the cognitive, emotional, and perceptual abilities that constitute the person general self-awareness. Chronic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes mellitus affect body awareness and image. Body awareness has been found to be associated with clinical parameters related to diabetes, such as fasting blood sugar and HbA1c levels and duration of diabetes in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Changes in body awareness may disrupt the patient self-perception, leading to a poor clinical picture and a poor course of chronic diseases. Therefore, it is important to evaluate possible changes in internal body perception.

To our knowledge, no study has been found in the literature examining the relationship between motor imagery skills of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and body awareness and cognitive functions. The existence of this relationship may guide the use of motor imagery as a treatment method in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus whose body awareness and cognitive functions are impaired.

The results of recent international trials in critically ill patients; however, have failed to show a significant improvement in mortality or have even shown increased mortality risk as well as increased number of hypoglycemic events with intensive compared to less intensive glycemic control. Based on the results of these ICU trials, new ADA and AACE guidelines recommended a glycemic target between 140 and 180 mg/dl in the ICU including cardiac surgery patients. There is concern that such high BG targets might increase the risk of hospital complications in cardiac surgical patients in whom intensive glucose control has consistently reduced infections, length of hospital stay, resource utilization, and cardiac-related mortality. The overall objective of this proposal is to conduct the first prospective RCT to determine the optimal BG target during the perioperative period in hyperglycemic subjects who undergo CABG in the United States. Subjects will be randomized to undergo intensive insulin therapy adjusted to maintain a BG between 100 mg/dl and 140 mg/dl or to a conventional glucose control with a target BG between 141 mg/dl and 200 mg/dl in the ICU. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that intensive insulin management will reduce perioperative complications compared to a conventional BG control in cardiac surgery patients.",COMPLETED,,2011-06,2013-12,2013-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,338,ACTUAL

NCT05951660,"Sex, Psychopharmacology, and Diabetes","The Effect of Targeted Education on Number, Severity, and Perception of Sexual Side Effects of Patients Suffering From Schizophrenia and Diabetes or Prediabetes.","The term sexual (SD) dysfunction covers conditions that prevent people from having a satisfactory sex life. SD is a frequent and sometimes debilitating complication of mental illness and a known adverse reaction to psycho-pharmacological treatment. SD is also associated with diabetes, a common somatic comorbidity in psychiatric patients. SD is associated with both reduced quality-of-life and reduced treatment adherence, yet SD is far too rarely addressed between the patient and the healthcare professional in clinical consultations.

The purpose of the study is to investigate whether targeted education of patients with schizophrenia and diabetes/prediabetes and/or their healthcare professionals in causes and management of SD:

* Increases the number of systematic examinations of sexual side effects,
* Causes changes in the psycho-pharmacological treatment, and
* Reduces the severity or perception of sexual side effects.

The study is a multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with four arms, in which the educational intervention is provided to patients, healthcare professionals, or both groups. The effect of the educational intervention is compared to a non-educated control group. The study is expected to include 192 patients recruited from 16 assertive community treatment centers evenly distributed in four Danish regions.

The study will use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to collect this information. The study drug or placebo will be administered using an intranasal device.,"Hypoglycemia occurs with high frequency among patients with T1D. With repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, the counter-regulatory pathways to restore normal glucose are blunted, and patients can become unaware of the hypoglycemia. It is estimated that 40% of patients with T1D have hypoglycemia unawareness.

The study has the following objectives:

1. Primary:

   a. To assess non-inferiority of dangerous hypoglycemia with administration of intranasal insulin in T1D participants with intact awareness of hypoglycemia.

NCT05059860,Dexcom Hybrid Closed Loop Insulin Pump Study in Type 1 Diabetes,An Evaluation of the Tandem IQ Insulin Pump and DEXCOM G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring Hybrid Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System (Control-IQ) on Patient Wellbeing and Diabetes Control in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes,"Treatment of Type 1 diabetes requires daily insulin therapy given by either multiple daily injections or by continuous infusion via a pump. The insulin dose is calculated taking into consideration blood glucose levels, food intake and activity levels, aiming to avoid high and low readings.

The Tandem t:slim X2™ insulin pump has recently become available in NHS Scotland and can link with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.

The Tandem Control IQ hybrid closed loop system is made up of the Tandem insulin pump communicating wirelessly with the Dexcom G6 CGM. The algorithm within the pump then automatically controls the background (basal) insulin infusion rate. Manually delivered bolus insulin is still required for meals. This system is designed to finely tune insulin delivery and increase the amount of time that glucose is in the target range, reducing hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.

Insulin pumps are funded by NHS Scotland, but the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system is not, so this hybrid closed loop system is not currently routinely available in NHS Scotland.

The purpose of this study is to gain experience of this system and investigate how effective and acceptable the hybrid closed loop system is for people in Scotland. Participants will be provided with the Dexcom G6 CGM device to link to their current pump to create the hybrid closed loop system for the duration of the study.

30 people with Type 1 diabetes who have been using the Tandem pump for at least one month will be invited to participate.

The study will include a screening visit, a 30 day run-in period, 52 week treatment period and 12 week follow-up period. Diabetes control will be measured using HbA1c and downloaded information from the hybrid closed loop system. Participants will also complete questionnaires and a reflective diary.","In those without diabetes insulin is automatically secreted according to requirement. The background insulin secretion rate will vary depending on need, and is affected by many factors e.g. activity or stress levels. When a person eats the rise of glucose is sensed and insulin automatically secreted to keep the glucose within a narrow range.

People with Type 1 diabetes cannot make insulin to control their blood glucose. Insulin is therefore required as treatment. This is given subcutaneously by injection or using an infusion pump. Both background insulin is required and boluses of insulin given when carbohydrate is eaten.

It is difficult to accurately calculate and deliver the correct amount of insulin. More recently standard treatment involved giving one of two injections of long acting insulin and more frequent injections of fast acting insulin when carbohydrate is ingested. The dose of insulin is determined by measuring the ambient glucose level, knowing the amount of carbohydrate in any meal and predicting activity during the subsequent four or five hours.

Insulin pumps can be used to provide a pre-tuned variable background insulin infusion with manual intervention to deliver boluses of insulin with food.

In Scotland many people have now replaced finger prick glucose testing with flash glucose monitoring. This uses a small subcutaneous needle that senses subcutaneous glucose levels and, when scanned this sensor will provide a measure of subcutaneous glucose and information on the last 8 hours of glucose values (Flash Glucose monitoring). This system does not currently link to an insulin pump.

The Tandem insulin pump has recently become available in NHS Scotland for those already established on pump therapy.

The Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system provides continuous glucose monitoring (without requiring any scanning by the patient) but is not currently funded within NHS Scotland, except for special circumstances. This system does communicate via bluetooth with the T-slim insulin pump.

The Tandem Control IQ insulin delivery system uses the link between the dexcom glucose sensor and pump to control the background insulin delivery and has been shown to work well in those studied. Patients still have to administer insulin when ingesting carbohydrate. This system is described as a hybrid closed loop system.

Problems that can potentially occur using this system include loss of communication between sensor and pump (bluetooth or wired connection), the algorithm not working or glucose readings out with the set ranges resulting in the automatic system turning off.

It is also unknown how acceptable the 'loss of control' is to a more general diabetes population as individuals with diabetes are used to making all the insulin dose decisions very frequently across each day. Confidence in these systems, both by patients and clinicians will be vital if these are to be introduced into more general use.

Therefore, the potential for these systems to have a major impact for people with diabetes is clear, but further understanding of the effectiveness and acceptability of such systems in the Scottish population is required.

The Investigator's aim is to investigate the effect of this system compared to current 'best practice' in Scotland, to gain experience in using this system and to investigate the acceptability of this system in the Scottish population.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2023-06-09,2025-11,2025-08-11,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,30,ESTIMATED

NCT05243160,Medication Reviews in Severe Mental Illness,Implementing Medication Reviews Through Interdisciplinary Dialogue in Patients With Coexisting Diabetes and Mental Illness,"This study aims to investigate the potential beneficial effects of a medication review by a clinical pharmacologist on patients with coexisting severe mental illness and diabetes. The study is an intervention study in which an intervention group is assigned to the medication review whereas a control group is not. Both groups are tested using an extensive test battery at baseline and 6 months after inclusion.

Furthermore a qualitative data assessment will be undertaken using interviews and/or surveys in order to show any obstacles in implementing the intervention. This is relevant as medication reviews, performed by clinical pharmacologists as well as pharmacists, are not always implemented by the primary physician.

The economic impact of the medication review will furthermore be assessed.","The effects of a medication review on patients with coexisting severe mental illness and diabetes:

Introduction:

Severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with an increased risk of diabetes (DM) and metabolic complications. The risk of type-2 diabetes is increased 2-3 fold in patients with SMI compared to the average population. This may lead to polypharmacy hence adverse drug interactions as well as adverse side effects emphasizing the need for a thorough medication review. Medication reviews by pharmacists is widely used and implemented in clinical practice. However, to the investigators knowledge studies on medication reviews by medical doctors specialized in the field of clinical pharmacology let alone on this patient cohort is scarce. Hence, this study seeks to investigate the effects of a medication review by a clinical pharmacologist on patients with coexisting severe mentall illness and diabetes.

Quality control:

The study protocol will be send for approval by the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics. Regarding data managing the study is send to Region Zealand's list of ongoing projects thereby ensuring responsible data managing in accordance with the current legislation.

Randomization:

The investigators aim to enroll approximatively 50 patients suffering from both severe mentall illness and diabetes (all types) in this study. Patients are drafted from the fusion clinic in Slagelse Denmark. The fusion clinic is a novel collaboration between endocrinologists and psychiatrists based in Slagelse Hospital department of psychiatry caring for patients with mental illness and diabetes. The clinic seeks to unite endocrinologists and psychiatrists in order to provide the best possible care for patients with coexisting severe mental illness and diabetes. Patients enrolled at the fusion clinic is invited to participate in this study and after having read and accepted the terms as well as the conditions of the study patients will be randomized to an intervention group as well as a control group. Using block-randomization patients will be distributed in blocks (3:3) thereby preventing any carry-over effect. Treatment arm allocation is hidden from the investigator thereby improving the quality of the data.

Data management:

Data will be accessible for co-authors as well as co-investigators participating in this study. Data will be entered into the RedCap module and written consent forms will be uploaded to this platform. Written files will be stored for 5 years at a safe location according to current legislation.

Intervention:

At baseline all participants recruited will undergo the following ratings: PANSS-6 (positive and negative syndrome scale), ""UKU side effects rating scale"" a danish acronym for the ""Task force for clinical investigations- rating scale"" a rating scale for measuring side effects associated with psychopharmacological treatment, MARS (medication adherence rating scale), CGI (clinical global impression scale), Hamilton-rating scale, Young manic rating scale and SF-12 (short form survey). Furthermore, data on medicinal load, potential drug-interactions, as well as potential side effects will be obtained at baseline. The intervention group will then be subject to a medication review by a clinical pharmacologist at the beginning of the trial whereas the control group will not. 6 months after the inclusion date both groups will be subject to the same test battery thereby showing any potential differences between the two groups.

Furthermore a qualitative data assessment of the intervention will be included in this study by interviewing clinicians and their percieved experience in using the medication review. The qualitative assessment will help to illuminate potential obstacles or barriers in implementing the medication review in real clinical practice.

Recruitment:

All patients will have to accept a written consent form thereby agreeing to participate in this study. By giving consent, the participant gives the examiner access to the patient record hence health data regarding the participant. Patients are at any time able to withdraw their consent throughout the study without effecting their ongoing treatment.

Ethics:

At the end of the study trial all patients will be offered the medication review thereby ensuring that all patients benefit from this additional expert assessment. The trial does not interfere with the usual treatment and there seems to be no additional risks for the patients participating in this study.

Funding:

The study is funded by the Steno diabetes center region Zealand Denmark and contains enough funding for 1 year of research. The research group is in the process of applying for funding for a 3- year research employment (ph.d.).

Perspective:

The investigators speculate as to whether a medication review by a clinical pharmacologist can improve not only the medicinal load but also reduce side effects, minimize adverse drug interactions, reduce financial burden asscoiated with the pharmacological treatment as well as manifest in a clinical difference for the patients. If the intervention proves useful the medication review is easily implemented in the Danish clinical practice and is therefore of relevance for the clinicians.",COMPLETED,,2022-03-11,2023-10-27,2023-10-27,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,48,ACTUAL

NCT02744976,Coronary Artery Disease Progression in Patients With Prediabetes,Coronary Artery Disease Progression by iMap Intravascular Ultrasound Analysis in Patients With Prediabetes,"Prediabetes is a disorder of glucose metabolism that reflects the natural history of progression from normoglycaemia to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with prediabetes have impaired glucose regulation caused by insulin resistance (IR). IR in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with coronary artery remodeling and coronary plaque vulnerability by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis. In stent restenosis after bare metal and drug-eluting stent implantation more frequently is observed in patients with high fasting-insulin levels and IR. Although IR has a significant role in the progression of atherosclerosis in prediabetic patients, the importance of managing prediabetes is often under-appreciated by clinicians. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been officially approved for prediabetes. According to American Diabetes Association recommendations, metformin is the only drug that could be considered in the treatment of prediabetic patients with a high risk of developing diabetes. Metformin is a safe and inexpensive glucose lowering drug that attenuates mortality and future cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as the progression of atherosclerosis in non-diabetic animal models. This study was designed to analyze coronary plaque characteristics by iMAP IVUS in patients with and without prediabetes undergoing PCI and to evaluate the impact of metformin treatment on coronary plaque characteristics in prediabetic patients at 24 month follow up.

The study hypothesis is that more pronounced coronary atherosclerosis progression as well as in-stent neointimal hyperplasia will be observed in patients with prediabetes. Metformin treatment attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with prediabetes.","Patients undergoing PCI and IVUS pullback for the target vessel will be enrolled in a prospective study.

Cardiovascular disease shows a continuous relationship with declining of renal function in type 2 diabetes patients. Moreover, there is a strong evidence of all-cause mortality risk excess even in patients with early stages kidney disease.

MicroRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA molecules, containing 21-25 nucleotides, that modulate post-transcriptional gene expressions. In the past years many human miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of renal disease have been discovered, such as miR-192, miR-194, miR-204 and miR-25. Among these, miR-192 and miR-25, are receiving greater attention while it seems that they play a role in glomerulosclerosis and renal fibrosis. However too few data are available in large publish trials among patients with renal impairment and the role of serum and urinary levels of miR-192 and miR-25 in people with preserved renal function remain unclear.

NCT00237094,Use of Midlevel Providers in Diabetes Management,Use of Midlevel Providers in Diabetes Management,"Studies have demonstrated that intensive disease management of diabetes and its associated risk factors, hypertension and dyslipidemia, can prevent the progression of vascular complications. However, implementation of well defined guidelines for intensive disease management has been suboptimal. Barriers to success occur at multiple levels, including health care systems, health care providers and patients.

In rural regions of the U.S., reduced availability of primary care providers and specialty services, including diabetes education, present additional barriers to effective diabetes care. Use of a nurse practitioner led interdisciplinary team to intensively manage urban and rural diabetic patients, utilizing telehealth technology to provide care to rural areas, will help begin to address these barriers

The long term goal of the project is to develop a practical and sustainable system of intensive diabetes management that will be effective in helping diabetic patients achieve and maintain goals within established treatment guidelines regardless of geographic location.

Specific aims are:

1. To determine in both urban and rural areas if a nurse practitioner led team approach to intensive diabetes management and education improves disease-specific outcomes and patient education compared to traditional care (current diabetes management of urban patients).
2. To determine if telehealth is an effective and accepted mechanism for delivery of a nurse practitioner led team approach to intensive diabetes management and education in rural areas.
3. To determine if a nurse practitioner led intensive disease management team can identify patient risk factors (psychological, financial, and work-related factors) that may be barriers to patient adherence, earlier in the management of urban diabetic patients compared to traditional care.
4. To compare volume and type of service utilization of a nurse practitioner led team approach to diabetes management and education to that of traditional care in both urban and rural areas.

Traditionally, a rapid-acting insulin IV infusion is begun immediately and continued until the acidosis is corrected and hyperglycemia normalized. Once the acidosis is corrected, patients are able to be transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen.

The role that a subcutaneous long-acting insulin such as glargine has in the acute treatment of DKA has not been extensively studied. While giving glargine during the treatment of DKA is becoming more common place, few studies have examined the potential risks and benefits of its use. This study will investigate the effects of early administration of glargine during DKA in patients with newly diagnosed TIDM.

The design of this study is a prospective, double-blind study of children ages 2-21 who are admitted to the hospital in DKA with a diagnosis of T1DM.

NCT00921960,St. Vincent's Screening To Prevent Heart Failure Study,"St. Vincent's Screening To Prevent Heart Failure (STOP-HF) Study Using Natriuretic Peptides to Identify and Prevent Progression of Left Ventricular Dysfunction in Community Based, Asymptomatic, At-risk Individuals.","The STOP-HF study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial recruiting asymptomatic individuals with risk factors for left ventricular dysfunction from 50 primary care clinics in Dublin and south east Ireland. It is designed to determine whether using natriuretic peptide measurement as a screening tool following a general cardiovascular risk factor screen will reduce the prevalence and severity of ventricular dysfunction in conjunction with specialist follow-up at St. Vincent's University Hospital.","A large proportion of the population has substantial left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and do not have symptoms (Stage B heart failure). For many of these patients, if identified and treated appropriately, it is possible to prevent the subsequent development of heart failure (HF). Although the current gold standard for detection of LVD is echocardiography, it is expensive and impractical for mass screening.

Natriuretic peptides are attractive candidates for screening populations for asymptomatic LVD particularly because of high negative predictive values. Furthermore, some studies have shown that, in the right setting, screening with natriuretic peptides might prove cost effective in combination with echocardiography for patients with elevated levels.

However, in common with many accepted screening strategies, there are no randomised studies which show that screening the population with natriuretic peptides for asymptomatic LVF alters the natural history of the condition.

From a large, community based cardiovascular risk screening programme including more than 13,000 patients, patients in the catchment area of St Vincent's University Hospital are invited to participate in the STOP-HF study. The objective of this work is to determine whether or not using natriuretic peptide screening in conjunction with specialist follow-up will reduce the prevalence and severity of LVD in a well-defined, at-risk, primary care population. It also aims to: evaluate the natural history of natriuretic peptides over time in this population; to clarify optimal screening cut-offs for the detection of LVD; to evaluate the clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, genetic and proteomic determinants of natriuretic peptides in this setting; to determine whether the clinical benefits of the STOP HF screening programme, if any, are cost effective.

The study design is prospective, randomised and parallel group.

The primary endpoint is the prevalence and severity LVD after 5 years of follow up. Secondary endpoints include: the natural history of natriuretic peptides; the relationship between natriuretic peptides and severity of LVD, death, hospital admissions; clinical, demographic, biochemical, pharmacological, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic determinants of natriuretic peptides; screening cost-effectiveness.

Participants who fulfill entry criteria at baseline will sign an informed consent and will be randomised onto the Usual Care or Intervention Care arm of the study. Usual care is defined as continued management of the patient by the primary care services using standard risk factor monitoring and intervention strategies. Intervention Care is defined as a collaborative cardiovascular management between primary care and specialist hospital based services. All participants will receive an intensive education session from a cardiovascular nurse on their risk factors and advice on healthy dietary and lifestyle habits.

There will be 2 years of enrollment with annual review and 5 years of follow-up to the primary endpoint. Permission has been received to extend the follow up period to 10 years. Regardless of randomisation, all patients receive full clinical and laboratory assessment at baseline and on completion of the STOP HF study (year 5). Additionally, all participants will receive echocardiography assessment during and at the conclusion of the study.

Data collection:

Data will be collected on all participants regarding their medical history and current medications. The source of data collection will be from medical records kept at the primary care practices and from patient interview. All participants will receive a booklet in which they will be asked to record any visits to their primary care practitioner, alterations in medications, new diagnoses and hospital admissions. Local hospital discharge records will be screened to detect any events throughout the course of the study.

Clinical Assessment:

At annual intervals, the cardiovascular research nurse will conduct clinical assessments on all participants including weight, abdominal girth measurement, blood pressure (triplicate measurements while lying in supine position), heart rate and observe for evidence of limb oedema. The nurse will also question the participants to investigate for symptoms of dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, orthopnoea, palpitations and fatigue.

Blood sampling and handling:

Peripheral venous blood samples will be drawn on all participants at annual intervals. Samples to assess natriuretic peptides will be drawn into vacutainers containing EDTA and samples to assess renal function, collagen turnover and lipid profile will be collected in vacutainers containing lithium heparin. BNP and Lipid profile assessment will be analysed using point of care meters, Biosite (Triage, USA) and Cholestech respectively. Each of the remaining samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes and the serum will be then aliquoted and stored at -80°C before analysis of biochemical, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic markers.

Echocardiographic Doppler analysis:

Two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, targeted M-mode and Doppler ultrasound measurements will be obtained in each patient. M-mode measurements are taken according to the guidelines laid down by the American Society of Echocardiography. All echocardiographic data will represent the mean of 3 measurements on different cardiac cycles. It is the aim of the STOP HF investigators that a single observer will conduct all measurements, recording archive images in a blinded fashion.",COMPLETED,,2005-01,2017-12,2017-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,1378,ESTIMATED

However, several studies reported that the fat and protein contents of the meals can also affect the postprandial blood glucose levels and result in delayed postprandial hyperglycemia especially after high fat and protein meals.

There is no widely accepted regimen to calculate insulin required for the fat and protein contents of meals especially for patients using multiple daily injection regimen. This study aims to find a better method to cover the increased insulin requirements following mixed fat and protein meals. The study will compare the effect of splitting mealtime bolus insulin doses into pre-meal and post-meal portions to the standard regimen which involve giving bolus dose depending on carbohydrate content only with additional correction doses 2 to 3 hours after the meal to compensate for the postprandial hyperglycemia induced by fat and protein content of the meals.","The study will include children and adolescents aged 6 - 18 years, diagnosed with T1DM for at least 1 year, using multiple daily injection regimen and carbohydrate counting. The study participants will be admitted at the pediatric department, Sohag University Hospital for 1 week to adjust insulin doses. adjustments will be made to basal doses, insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR), insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) if required.

The study participants will have three test lunch meals on 3 consecutive days consumed at the pediatric department, Sohag university hospital at 12 PM. The test meals will consist of two slices of a deep pan pizza base topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella full fat soft cheese, and minced beef. (weight: 150 g, carb. 40 g, fat: 15 g, protein: 20 g, total calories 360 kcal). The meal will be consumed within 20 minutes.

Blood glucose level before the meal should be between 80 to 150 mg/dl. Correction doses can be given 3 hours before the test if needed to bring the blood glucose level to the desired target range before the test meals.

The participant will be assigned to use each one of the following interventions on a separate day in a random sequence.

* Intervention A: the participant will have a mealtime bolus dose of fast-acting insulin 10 minutes before the meal representing 100% of the dose calculated according to the carbohydrate content of the meal and the individual insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR). If hyperglycemia (blood glucose level \>180 mg/dl) developed after 3 hours, the participant will receive an additional correction dose of fast-acting insulin calculated according to the individual insulin sensitivity factor (ISF).
* Intervention B: the bolus insulin dose for the meal will be calculated according to the carbohydrate content of the meal and the individual insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and additional 30% of the calculated dose will added to cover the fat and protein content of the meal. This total dose will be divided into 2 portions. A premeal portion (60% of the total dose) will be given 10 minutes before the meal. The remaining 40% of the total dose will be given 30 minutes after the premeal dose. Both doses will be given as fast-acting insulin.
* Intervention C: the bolus insulin dose for the meal will be calculated according to the carbohydrate content of the meal and the individual insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and additional 30% of the calculated dose will added to cover the fat and protein content of the meal. This total dose will be divided into 2 portions. A premeal portion (60% of the total dose) will be given 10 minutes before the meal as fast-acting insulin. The remaining 40% of the total dose will be given 30 minutes after the premeal dose as regular insulin.

Types of insulin: insulin lispro (Humalog 100 IU/mL) as fast-acting insulin and regular insulin (Humulin R) as regular insulin (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Insulin doses will be calculated, splitted, approximated to the nearest 0.5 unit and given using Humapen Luxura half- unit increments insulin pens.

Among individuals with diabetes, those with a specific variation in a genetic marker called Haptoglobin (approximately 43% of persons with type 1 diabetes) are at even greater risk compared to those not carrying this genetic variation. A genetic marker or a ""gene"" is information inherited from parents (a blueprint) about the structure and functions of cells in the body that make up the color of our hair and eyes and may influence the way our bodies respond to certain stimuli such as an illness, or infection.

In this project we are seeking to understand what some of the mechanisms may be that put persons with type 1 diabetes and this variation in the Haptoglobin gene at greater risk for heart disease. Specifically, we will assess whether this gene variant affects the function of the good cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) and its subfractions (via NMR spectroscopy), which is thought to help against heart disease development. We also seek to evaluate whether vitamin E supplements may improve this function. If results indicate that vitamin E is beneficial and improves the function of HDL cholesterol, the next question to be answered would be whether vitamin E would also help reduce the risk of heart disease itself in these persons.

The investigators do not however know how these treatments compare to each other and how they act in the body to cause weight loss and diabetes improvements. The studies of this experiment are complementary to each other. They aim to answer related questions and will allow us to study how these treatments work and eventually develop safer and more effective therapies for obesity and diabetes.,"The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of obesity surgical procedures and incretin therapies on food preferences, satiety, gut hormones, bile acids and hepatic glucose output in overweight and obese patients.

As part of routine care these patients will be seen by a dietician/diabetes specialist nurse (DSN) before and after intervention. Patients will be asked to prospectively complete food diaries on three consecutive days which are representative of their usual dietary intake. The first food diary will be completed three months to two weeks pre intervention. Another four food diaries will be completed post intervention: at one, three months, 6 months and one year. Total energy intake and macronutrient composition comparisons pre and post intervention will form the basis of our analysis.

20 patients in each group will undergo more detailed measurements of food intake, hunger, satiety, gut hormones and bile acids.

NCT03157960,Effect of Acute Fructose Load in Human,The Effect of Acute Fructose Load in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Compared to Healthy Subjects,"The metabolism of the monosaccharide fructose is less controlled than the metabolism of glucose, which will result in the metabolic product uric acid. Elevated serum uric acid levels are associated with increased risk, or worsening, of chronic kidney disease. The mechanisms by which uric acid have detrimental effects are not well defined, but may include an increase in reactive oxygen species and subsequent inflammatory activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of uric acid, markers of oxidative stress and markers of inflammation following a low fructose load reflecting normal conditions. This is an interventional study. On six different occasions patients with chronic kidney disease, patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls will receive Blueberry drink, Coca-Cola or pure Fructose drink with similar amount of carbohydrates (140 kcal) with and without a high fat meal represented by a pizza (425 kcal).Serum samples and urinary samples will be collected.","Fructose is a monosaccharide present naturally in foods as fruit, vegetables and honey. In fruit, vegetables and table sugar it is also present as a disaccharide (sucrose), where it is joined with glucose. The intake of fructose has increased dramatically in the last decades. The increase is attributed to the use of free fructose as a sweetener at higher concentrations than naturally occurring in food, where beverages as soft-drinks seem to be the largest contributor to present consumption. Fructose has a low glycemic index and thus helps maintain glycemic control, a property that led to the belief that it was beneficial as a sweetener for those with diabetes.

The body's capacity of absorbing fructose is limited and varies depending on age, health and co-ingested foods. Glucose is the dietary factor that has largest impact on fructose absorption, but animal studies also indicate that saturated fat increase absorption. It has been observed that the maximum fructose absorbing capacity varies between 5 and 50 g when consumed as a single dose. Individuals with type 2 diabetes seems to have a larger capacity to absorb fructose and they have higher levels of fructose in serum and urine when compared to those without diabetes.

Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine by the fructose specific transporter GLUT5. It is further transported to the liver through the portal vein, where it is absorbed and metabolized by liver cells. The metabolism of fructose is independent of insulin. Although some fructose is metabolized by the enterocytes in the small intestine, the liver metabolize the majority of ingested fructose, in comparison to about 15-30% of ingested glucose. The metabolism of fructose differs from glucose in the sense that it is less controlled. While glucose metabolism is regulated by the energy status of the cell and portal glucose concentrations, fructose metabolism lacks control mechanisms leading to different metabolic products and effects.

In the metabolic pathway fructose can be oxidized, converted to glucose or lactic acid, or enter de novo lipogenesis. In the first hepatic metabolic step fructose is phosphorylated by fructokinase, a fructose specific enzyme with high activity, to fructose-1-phosphate. Fructokinase is not regulated by the energy status (ATP) of the cell, and fructose will therefore be metabolized in an unlimited way. This is in contrast to steps in the glycolysis where phosphofructokinase is regulated by ATP. Due to the rapid phosphorylation of fructose, levels of ATP will be depleted followed by an increase in uric acid. An increase in reactive oxygen species will follow the formation of uric acid which may lead to inflammation in the endothelium and inflammatory activity in adipocytes. Animal models show that uric acid may also act directly on tubular cells in the kidney where it causes inflammation. Serum uric acid levels are moreover positively associated with renin activity and hypertension. Further, as fructose is metabolized in a less controlled way than glucose, a larger proportion of fructose is available for de novo lipogenesis (DNL). This may be due to that the capacity of the mitochondria is exceeded and acetyl-Coenzyme A will enter DNL instead of the citric acid cycle. This metabolic effect of glucose is considered as ""particularly harmful"". Whether glucose is co-ingested with fructose or not may have an impact on the metabolic effects as there will be an effect of secreted insulin. Insulin decreases production of glucose from fructose and stimulates the de novo lipogenesis pathway.

The increase in fructose consumption correlates closely with the rise in obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Long term consumption of fructose has been shown to cause increased uric acid in the body. Elevated serum uric acid levels are associated with risk of chronic kidney disease both among healthy subject and among those with diabetes. Among those with type 2 diabetes it has also been associated with progression of already established nephropathy.

It is estimated that 7.3 % of the adult population in Sweden is affected by diabetes and that the majority, 85 -90 %, constitutes of type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is considered to be one of the most common chronic diseases and the prevalence is expected to rise, and with that an increasing health and economic burden. Worldwide patterns indicate a growing burden as well, particularly in developing countries. T2D is a disease with multifactorial etiology and with complications such as cardiovascular and renal disease, blindness and amputation. Not only does diabetes affect quality of life, it also leads to premature death as life expectancy is reduced with as much as 15 years.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most common cause of end-stage renal disease and the earliest sign of DN is presence of microalbuminuria. Further development of macroalbuminuria and a decline in glomerular filtration rate may follow. Among type 2 diabetics in Sweden it was observed that 20% developed albuminuria over the course of 5 years, and 11% developed renal impairment glomerular filtration rate (eGFR of \< 60 mL/min/1.73m2, MDRD formula). Studies indicate that increased oxidative stress through different pathways may play a central role in the development of DN, and chronic hyperglycemia is the primary cause. But there are also other factors that increase oxidative stress and have an impact on development of renal disease, as for example free fatty acids and inflammation. The oxidative stress may cause damage to the renal milieu, as dysfunction of the endothelial cells within glomeruli and tissue injury of the tubule.

Factors related to disease management, as glycemic-, blood pressure- and lipid-control are important in protecting the kidney. Further, smoking cessation, energy balance for a healthy bodyweight and a healthy eating pattern are of importance. In regards of dietary composition, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia is determined by the amount and quality of ingested carbohydrates and dietary fats. It has been suggested that postprandial hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia triggers oxidative stress and causes inflammation, metabolic alterations associated with endothelial dysfunction. A prospective cohort conducted in 10 European countries, including Sweden (Malmö and Umeå) showed a protective effect of intake of vegetables, fruit and legumes against all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among those with diabetes. Possible mechanism is hypothesized to be attributed to the antioxidative properties. The anti-antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of fruit and vegetables are mentioned as possible mechanisms.

Current Swedish dietary recommendation for diabetic's state that different diets as the Mediterranean and low carbohydrate diet etc. may be beneficial, while the scientific evidence for extremely low carbohydrate diet is yet too weak. They further state that single foods as fruit lower all-cause mortality and vegetables lowers the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Fructose is not discussed in the Swedish dietary recommendations. The American Diabetes Associations dietary recommendations do, however, state that fructose-containing beverages should be avoided due to its impact on metabolic profile.

The scientific evidence for the significance of diet on microvascular complications as kidney disease is scarce and there is a lack of studies on the effect of fruit and vegetables on diabetic nephropathy. This was also stated by Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU) in a report published in 2010. SBU further emphasized the lack of dietary studies applicable to conditions in Sweden. Thus, considering the burden of type 2 diabetes and its related complications, the need for proposed studies is substantiate.

The overall aim of this study is to investigate the acute postprandial responses in uric acid, markers of oxidative stress and marker of inflammation after low fructose load with and without a high fat meal among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with and without CKD compared to healthy controls (HC).

Patients with type 2 diabetes, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and GFR \<30 ml/min or dialysis, patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD and control subjects (n= 30 in each group) will be included. Participant will on sex different occasions receive drinks containing fructose with and without the addition of a high-fat meal. After including 8 patients with CKD, 8 patients with T2DM and 8 controls, the preliminary results will be presented.",COMPLETED,,2012-02-01,2021-11-30,2019-11-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,BASIC_SCIENCE,20,ACTUAL

National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred caloric replacement strategy for SSBs. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and blood pressure in randomized trials. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk. Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.","Rationale:

Soy is at a nutritional ""cross-roads"". On one hand, it aligns with current dietary advice to consume plant-based dietary patterns \[1-6\] and has proven advantages \[7-9\]. On the other hand, it is under threat to have its health claim for CHD risk reduction revoked \[10\] and is often overshadowed by dairy in public health interventions for metabolic health. Strategies to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) have become one of the leading public health targets to address the epidemics of obesity and diabetes \[10-22\]. National food, nutrition, and health policies and programs have positioned low-fat milk as the preferred replacement strategy for SSBs \[23-27\]. This strategy derives from evidence that replacement of SSBs with low-fat milk is associated with reductions in weight and incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies \[28,29\] and reduces liver fat (an important early metabolic lesion linking obesity to diabetes), as well as triglycerides and BP in randomized trials \[30\]. Whether these benefits hold for soy milk alternatives, which have shown distinct advantages over cow's milk for intermediate metabolic outcomes \[7,31-33\], is unclear. There is an urgent need for studies to clarify the metabolic benefits of soy milk as an alternative to cow's milk.

Objective:

Our overarching aim is to produce high-quality clinical evidence that informs the use of soy as a ""public health intervention"" for addressing the dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes and overall metabolic health. To achieve this aim, we propose to conduct the Soy Treatment Evaluation for Metabolic health (STEM) trial, a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of using 2% soy milk (soy protein vehicle) versus 2% cow's milk (casein and whey vehicle matched for protein and volume) as a ""public health intervention"" to replace SSBs on liver fat and key cardiometabolic mediators/indicators in an at risk population.

Design:

The trial will be a 6-month, 2-phase, 3-arm, non-inferiority, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of replacing SSBs with 2% soy milk versus 2% cow's milk on the primary outcome liver fat and secondary outcomes muscle fat, insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, glucose tolerance and established cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who are consuming ≥3 SSBs/day. The trial will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and reported according to CONSORT and the COSORT extension for non-inferiority trials \[34\]. The 3-arm design has the advantage of combing a superiority trial with a non-inferiority trial, by allowing us to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and reference (2% cow's milk) treatments over the control (SSBs) and the noninferiority of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment simultaneously. We chose a treatment duration of 24-weeks as this was the duration over which milk was shown to reduce liver fat in replacement for SSBs \[30\] and is a duration that will have a meaningful impact on public health policy \[35,36\].

Participants:

We will include186 overweight or obese (BMI, 27-40 kg/m2) adult (age, 18-75 years) men and nonpregnant women with MetS based on modified IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAAS/IASO \[37\] criteria (high waist circumference \[≥88cm females, ≥102cm males\] plus ≥2 of 4 dysglycemia \[FPG ≥5.6mmol/L\], high triglycerides \[≥1.7mmol/L\], low HDL-C \[\<1.0mmol/L males and \<1.3 mmol/L females\], or high blood pressure \[≥130/85mmHg\]) who are consuming ≥3 SSBs/day. We have modified the MetS definition to require a high WC to ensure the sample is enriched with participants with NAFLD (defined as hepatic steatosis/intrahepatocellular lipid \[IHCL\] by 1H-MRS ≥5.0%) \[38\]. We anticipate \> 50% of the sample will have NAFLD based on our entry criteria \[38,39\]. We will exclude individuals with diabetes or major illness.

Randomization:

The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) will perform block randomization with allocation concealment through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) program. Following successful completion of the run-in phase, participants will be randomized into 3 groups from each strata, using random permuted blocks with unequal sizes.

Protocol:

The trial will be conducted at the CFI-funded Toronto 3D Clinical Research Centre and MRI Research Unit and at the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Centre at St. Michael's Hospital. Eligible participants will undergo a 4-week run-in phase prior to randomization. Participants who wish to continue will then undergo a 24-week intervention phase in which they are randomized (see above) to 1 of 3 interventions: ≥3 servings of (1) 2% soy milk (test treatment), (2) 2% cow's milk (reference treatment/positive control) or (3) their usual SSBs (negative control). All study beverages will be provided with the instruction to replace usual SSBs intake while maintaining background diets. Participants will attend clinic visits every 4-weeks for review of beverage logs, collection of study foods, and clinical assessments of weight, waist circumference \[40\], and blood pressure. 1H-MRS measurements and 75g oral glucose tolerance tests (75g-OGTT; World Health Organization protocol \[41\]) with blood samples at -30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes will be performed at 0 and 24 weeks as will collection of the Harvard Willett FFQ), and blood and fecal samples. Adherence biomarker samples will be collected at 0, 12, and 24 weeks.

Interventions:

The 3 interventions will consist of ≥3 servings of (1) 2% soy milk (Alpro Soya, 250mL single-serve shelf-stable packs, 100Kcal with 8g soy protein per 250mL), (2) 2% cow's milk (Organic Meadows®, 250mL, single-serve shelf-stable packs, 130Kcal with 8g casein/whey protein per 250mL), or (3) usual SSBs (355mL single-serve cans, 130-140kcal per 355mL). The participant's usual level of intake of SSBs will determine the dose (number of servings), providing a range of doses (that is, ≥ 3-servings or 24g protein for the soy and cow's milk) for dose response analyses. Although the soy and milk interventions will be matched for protein and serving size, we intentionally did not make the 3 interventions isocaloric, as the goal was to use ""real-world"" product substitutions.

Outcomes:

All outcome assessments will be blinded and assessed as the end value at week 24. The primary outcome will be liver fat (intrahepatocellular lipid \[IHCL\]) by 1H-MRS). Secondary outcomes will include change from baseline at week 24 of 75g-OGTT derived changes in insulin sensitivity (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index \[ISI\] \[42\]), beta-cell function (insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 \[ISSI-2\]) \[43,44\], and glucose tolerance (2hPG, iAUC). Exploratory outcomes will include ectopic muscle fat (intramyocellular lipid \[IMCL\]), continuous MetS criteria (waist circumference \[WC\], FPG, triglycerides \[TG\], HDL-C, and blood pressure \[BP\]), reversion of MetS (defined as a reversion to \<3 of 5 IDF/NHLBI/AHA/WHF/IAAS/IASO criteria \[37\]; diabetes incidence (Diabetes Canada 2018 FPG, 2h-PG (75g-OGTT), or HbA1c criteria), and body weight, gut microbiome diversity (16S rRNA sequencing), markers of NAFLD (liver enzymes \[ALT, AST, GGT, ALP\], fatty liver index (FLI) \[45\]), hepatic insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), inflammation (hs-CRP), uric acid, established lipid targets (LDL-C, non-HDL-C), and diet quality (Alternative Healthy Eating Index \[AHEI\] using the Harvard Willett FFQ \[46\]). Adherence outcomes will include study beverage logs and objective biomarkers of intake of soy milk (urinary isoflavonoid excretion \[UIE\]\[47\]), cow's milk (dairy-derived serum fatty acids \[15:0, 17:0, CLA, trans-palmitoleic acid\]\[48\]), and SSBs (isotopic ratios of 13C/12C in serum fatty acids \[49\]).Other post hoc exploratory outcomes will be decided based on the availability of funding.

Data Management:

The Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC), St. Michael's Hospital, will manage the digital database (REDCap) securely and ensure data integrity. This independent third party data management will be an important strength, bringing a high degree of credibility to the research.

Power:

A total of 186 participants will be randomized. N=62 per group will allow us to test the non-inferiority of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment with a non-inferiority margin (δ) of 75% of the effect of the reference treatment on the primary outcome ntra-hepatocellular lipid (IHCL) by 1H-MRS (1.5% absolute difference in IHCL based on a 75% preserved fraction of an expected 2% absolute difference in IHCL) by difference of means \[57\], assuming an SD of 3%, α=0.05, 80% power (β=0.20), and 20% attrition. A 2% absolute difference in IHCL was chosen as it is the minimum mean difference associated with clinically meaningful changes in downstream glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and/or blood lipids \[51-56\]. A non-inferiority margin (δ) of 75% was selected based on guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency \[58-60\]. This sample size will provide us ample power to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and the reference (2% cow's milk) treatments compared with the control (SSBs) treatment assuming the same 2% absolute difference in IHCL, SD of 3%, α=0.05, 80% power (β=0.20), and 20% attrition. It will also provide us with sufficient power for superiority testing of the secondary outcomes.

Statistical analysis:

All statistical analyses will be conducted using STATA 14 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) or a suitable statistical software package on end values at week-24 . The 3-arm design of the trial is intended to test the superiority of the active (2% soy milk) and reference (2% cow's milk) treatments compared with the control treatment (SSBs) and the noninferiority of the active treatment (2% soy milk) compared with the reference treatment (2% cow's milk).

The testing of the primary outcome will be done in a stepwise manner to decrease the familywise error rate. We will first undertake superiority testing of the active treatment (2% soy milk) and the reference treatment (2% cow's milk) compared with the control treatment (SSB). The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle with inverse probability weighting (IPW) \[https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2215\] to account for missing values. Data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models with significance set at a p \< 0.05. Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, per protocol, and ITT with multiple imputations (MI). If superiority is established in the primary analysis (confirming the ""assay sensitivity""), then we will undertake non-inferiority testing of the active (2% soy milk) compared with the reference (2% cow's milk) treatment using per protocol analysis. If the upper bound of the 90% CI is less than the 1.5% non-inferiority margin \[δ\] by difference of means, then the active treatment (2% soy milk) will be considered non-inferior to the reference treatment (2% cow's milk). If the upper bound of the 90% CI of the difference of means is less than both the 1.5% non-inferiority margin \[δ\] and the 0 value (unity), then the active treatment (2% soy milk) will be considered superior to the reference treatment (2% cow's milk). The primary analysis for non-inferiority will be a per protocol analysis. Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, ITT with IPW and ITT with MI.

Secondary, exploratory, and adherence outcomes will be assessed by superiority testing among the active treatment (2% soy milk), reference treatment (2% cow's milk), and control treatment (SSB).By reporting all estimated effects and confidence intervals with p-values, the necessary context is provided for a proper interpretation of the statistical evidence \[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108\]. If it is required for a future regulatory submission, then the secondary outcomes will be adjusted for false discovery. The approach will depend on the results of the primary outcome. If the superiority testing of the primary outcome is significant, then we will analyze the secondary outcomes using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling method with a starting alpha of 0.05 to correct for false discovery \[80\]. The sample size was selected to allow sufficient power for this analytical approach. The primary analysis will be conducted according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle with IPW to account for any missing values. Data will be analyzed using ANCOVA models for continuous data (mean differences with 95% CIs) and logistic regression models for categorical data (odds ratio with 95% CI for MetS reversion and relative risk with 95% CI for diabetes incidence). Adjustments will made for for age, sex, NAFLD status, medication use, intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline level of the end value. Sensitivity analyses will include completers, per protocol analyses, and ITT with MI.

Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted using Chi-square tests by age, sex, NAFLD status, caffeinated beverage use (cola vs non-cola drinkers), intervention dose (servings/day), and baseline waist circumference, FPG, 2hPG, Triglycerides, HDL-C, BP. Continuous linear (dose response gradient ) and non-linear (dose response threshold) dose-response analyses will be undertaken over the natural dose response range (3, 4, 5, or 6 servings per day) by multiple linear regression and piecewise regression analyses, respectively.

NCT04907760,Personalized Follow-up Program in the Type 2 Diabetes Prevention,Personalized Follow-up Program in the Type 2 Diabetes Prevention,"In France, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to 5% of the population in 2016, the type two diabetes (DT2) corresponding to 90% of cases. This number is widely underestimated because most people are untreated and undiagnosed. Due to the silent character of this disease, it is estimated that 20 à 30 % of diabetic adults have not yet been diagnosed. The conclusions, presented during the annual meeting of EASD in 2019, suggest that the precursor signs of this disease could be present until 20 years before the diagnosis.

Diabetes is a metabolic disease and people are diagnosed, in general, around 40-50 years old. The main risk factor of type II diabetes is lifestyle (rich diet, sedentary) but there is also other factors like hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure, high fasting blood sugar, stress, smoking, heredity, family history of diabetes, or gestational diabetes. This induces an increase of obesity, itself a major risk factor for type II diabetes occurrence.

From an economical aspect, chronic pathologies (including diabetes) represent 60% of health insurance expenses, even though it concerns 35% of insured persons, i.e. 20 million of patients. The average of annual reimbursement for a type 2 diabetic patient is 4890 euros. In this context, this study is the first step of thinking about a different, coordinated care approach, based on a preventive rather than curative approach.","This study includes a personalized care program, including the patient follow-up by a nurse during 5 years with a contact every 4 months for the first year, then after every 6 months. The nurse will review the patient's progress and provide advice and contact with professionals: physical activity, psychologists, dieticians, endocrinologists, etc The main objective of this study is to compare, after 5 years of follow-up, the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, between participants who received personalized follow-up and those who did not. The secondary objectives are to compare the occurrence of type 2 diabetes, the quality of life and the compliance to the program between participants who received personalized follow-up and those who did not.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2021-10-10,2026-10-10,2026-10-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,230,ESTIMATED

Without timely diagnosis and adequate medical intervention, the visual impairment can become a great burden on individuals as well as the society. It is estimated that China has 110 million patients under the attack of diabetes, 180 million patients with hypertension, 120 million patients suffering from high myopia and 200 million people over 60 years old, which suggest a huge population at the risk of blindness. Despite of this crisis in public health, our society has no more than 3,000 ophthalmologists majoring in fundus oculi disease currently. As most of them assembling in metropolitan cities, health system in this field is frail in primary hospitals. Owing to this unreasonable distribution of medical resources, providing medical service to hundreds of millions of potential patients threatened with blindness is almost impossible.

To solve this problem, this software (MCS) was developed as a computer-aided diagnosis to help junior ophthalmologists to detect 13 major retina diseases from color fundus photographs. This study has been designed to validate the safety and efficiency of this device.","As a prospective clinical trial, This study enjoys multicentric, blind film reading, self-control and superiority test design. In total, 1,500 retinal fundus images from 750 individuals in need of fundus examination (one image for every single eye) were selected. Then a test group, along with a control group was set up in our study. For the test group, ophthalmologists read images with the aid of the assistant software(MCS). In contrast, the same work in the control group was finished by ophthalmologists independently. Meanwhile, the gold standard were obtained from the cooperation of senior ophthalmologists. Diagnoses of both groups were compared with those of the gold standard, thus the investigators could evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this assistant software in diagnosis.

The primary endpoint of this study is the superiority of the consistency rate of the test group. A diagnosis for an image is consistent if it gives the same negative result as the reference standard, or reveals any one condition indicated by the reference standard. The consistency rate is the rate of consistent diagnoses for all the involved images. One control group is designed, where each doctor reads and diagnoses, and give at most 3 possible conditions for each image. In the test group, doctors do the same thing with the help of this software. The investigators in the test group and control group are the same and they are chosen from ophthalmologists with 1\~3 years experience. The reference standard of each fundus image is collaboratively given by retinal specialists/fellows from 5 centers. The investigator of XieHe center is the arbitrator if full consensus cannot be reached for any image during the building of reference standard.",COMPLETED,,2020-08-10,2021-05-30,2021-03-10,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,748,ACTUAL

NCT01414660,"Evolution of Interleukin 7, Fat Mass and Metabolic Profile Before and After Transplantation","Adipocytes, Insulin Resistance and Immunity: Evolution of Interleukin 7, Fat Mass and Metabolic Profile Before and After Transplantation","Three different white adipose tissue-related disorders, whether due to its excess (obesity), absence (lipoatrophies) or aberrant distribution (lipodystrophies), are paradoxically able to induce metabolic insulin resistance syndrome. The respective roles played by quantitative and qualitative anomalies of adipose tissue, gluco- and lipo-toxicity, liver and muscle insulin resistance, low-grade fat inflammation and immune alterations are not yet perfectly understood. In contrast to most organ transplantations that are often complicated by post-transplantation diabetes, diabetes cell therapy is associated with body weight loss, which is possibly related to the antiadipogenic effects of mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin or sirolimus). The aim of this study is thus to determine and monitor blood interleukin-7 and other cytokine levels; metabolic parameters; and fat mass distribution with DEXA and RMN, before and after a immunosuppressive regimen in patients receiving different kinds of transplantation (liver, kidney or islets) with normal weight and no type 2 diabetes before transplantation. In these patients, blood samples will be taken before and after transplantation, as will adipose tissue during the transplantation surgery, in order to constitute a plasma serum, gene and tissue bank for improving our knowledge of disorders linking fat mass, insulin resistance and immunity, especially post-transplantation diabetes.","Rationale: Due to their ability to store fatty acids and to secrete numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipocytes appear to be key cells in the regulation of energy metabolism and immune response. Moreover, it has been recently shown that adipocytes play a role in the recruitment of cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity in adipose tissue.

White adipose tissue-related diseases are numerous, whether from its excess (obesity), or its complete (lipoatrophies) or partial absence (lipodystrophies); these 3 different disorders are paradoxically able to induce metabolic insulin resistance syndrome.

Among the involved cytokines, interleukin-7 (IL-7), mostly known for its immune functions, also participates in the quantitative and qualitative balance of fat mass. Thus, IL-7 over-expression in animal models induces a lipodystrophic syndrome with insulin resistance, whereas in humans a preliminary study shows that LMNA-linked lipodystrophies are associated with an increase of blood IL-7 levels. IL-7 also participates in reactivation of autoimmunity in patients with autoimmune type 1 after islet transplantation.

Otherwise, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have immunosuppressive, metabolic and anti-tumoral properties through different signaling pathways. Rapamycin (or sirolimus) (Rapamune®), an mTOR inhibitor used in islet transplantation, has much greater ability to inhibit adipocyte differentiation and to modulate ß cell function according to the energetic status. In contrast to most organ transplantation, diabetes cell therapy is associated with body weight loss, which is possibly related to the antiadipogenic effects of mTOR inhibitors; the specific role that this plays on the prognostic factors of islet transplantation remains to be determined. Conversely, organ transplantation is usually associated with weight gain, which is involved in the genesis of post-transplantation diabetes, AKA new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), and long-term vascular complications of transplantation. Adipose tissue redistribution has not yet been studied in patients after transplantation.

The aim of this study is thus to determine blood IL-7 and other cytokine levels; metabolic parameters; and fat mass distribution before and after a immunosuppressive regimen in patients receiving different kinds of transplantation (liver, kidney or islets) with normal weight and no type 2 diabetes before transplantation. In these patients, blood samples will be taken before and after transplantation, as will adipose tissue during the transplantation surgery, in order to constitute a plasma, serum, gene and tissue bank for determining the mechanisms linking fat mass, insulin resistance and immunity, both ex vivo and in vitro.

Patients: The included patients are normal-weight subjects enlisted for liver, kidney or islet transplantation, with no type 2 diabetes (for liver and kidney transplantation).

Methods: Blood IL-7 levels, other immune and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte immunophenotype, metabolic parameters, and fat mass with non-invasive methods (DEXA and RMN) will be assessed before and one-year after transplantation. Blood, before and after transplantation, as well as adipose tissue during transplantation surgery, will be sampled in order to constitute a blood, gene and tissue bank for defining the inflammatory status of this tissue using histological and molecular analysis.

Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint will be IL-7 blood levels in the different groups according to fat mass, metabolic parameters and immunosuppressive regimen. The hypothesis is that an increase of IL-7 levels, possibly induced by immunosuppressive regimen, is associated with quantitative and/or qualitative disturbances of adipose tissue and the development of insulin resistance.

Expected results and possible implications: This study will enable the consequences of immunosuppression on IL-7 levels, adipose tissue disturbances and glucose metabolism to be determined. Our approach combining clinical investigation and ex vivo and in vitro analysis is original and should result in better understanding of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the inflammatory process initiated in white adipose tissue and accompanying the disorders of this tissue (especially post-transplantation diabetes), thus opening new therapeutic perspectives in a major complication of transplantation.",COMPLETED,,2010-06-09,2018-02,2018-02,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,49,ACTUAL

The presentation of content and delivery mechanisms of these Guides, however, needs to be modified to increase their use and impact among these difficult-to-reach populations.

To achieve this goal, a long-standing collaboration among African American and Latino community organizations, health care centers and systems, public health organizations, and academics (the REACH Detroit Partnership) is joining with leading experts in the development of personally and culturally tailored health decision aids (University of Michigan's Center for Health Communications Research \[CHCR\] and Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in Medicine \[CBDSM\]).

The investigators will develop and evaluate a computer tailored online diabetes medication decision aid that will enable community health workers (CHWs) to provide personalized patient education materials to underserved diabetic African American and Latino adults in Detroit, Michigan.","The Specific Aims of this study are:

Aim 1: To use the information in the two diabetes medications consumer CERSGs to build an interactive, computer tailored diabetes medication guide that will enable patients to assess their treatment goals, personal preferences, and side-effect concerns and generate a personally tailored assessment of their current diabetes treatments with, as appropriate, options for improving their diabetes care;

Aim 2: To determine the extent to which this personally tailored diabetes medication guide compared with the print consumer guides reduces Latino and African American diabetes patients' decisional conflict, through improved knowledge of anti-hyperglycemic medications and satisfaction with information received.

Aim 3: To examine the computer tailored program's effects on participants' changes in medications (medication intensification), self-reported medication adherence and beliefs and A1C levels between baseline and follow-up compared to participants receiving the print consumer guides.",COMPLETED,,2011-09,2013-10,2013-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,190,ACTUAL

The study hypothesizes that using mHealth influences food literacy and dietary behavior and may result in a reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by at least 0. 3% in 12 weeks in adults with type 2 diabetes. This study will be conducted in Nakuru County, a cosmopolitan county located in Northwestern Kenya. Participants will be eligible to be included in the study if they will meet the following criteria: (i) adults over the age of 18 years; (ii) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the previous 1 year and obtaining care at a participating level 4 hospital; (iii) able to read and write English or Swahili Language; (iv) currently own and able to read and send mobile text messages using any phone. Participants will be excluded if they are on dialysis or pregnant. The primary outcome measure will be HbA1c, which shall be measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures will include fasting plasma Glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Other secondary outcome measures will include anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences) and behaviour change (changes in dietary intake of legumes, fruits and vegetables). Additionally, mHealth satisfaction shall be assessed at 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-intervention to assess the sustainability of the intervention.","A sample size of 60 a-priori (n=30 intervention, n=30 control arm) was determined to assess feasibility of text messaging in optimizing glycemic control. It is anticipated that this proof-of-concept study will obtain parameters that will be used in determining a robust power calculation for a fully powered efficacy trial. Purposive sampling will be used to select two hospitals, one in a rural setting and another in an urban setting in Nakuru County, Kenya. Multistage random sampling using computer-generated list of random numbers will then be applied to randomly assign 15 participants to either the intervention arm or control arm. The hospitals' diabetes registers will be used to select patients on regular diabetes care from the hospital patient records.

The intervention group will receive a total of 43 text messages developed using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) approach. The text messages that are linked to specific behavior change techniques will provide practical information or guidance to influence selection and eating of healthy diet for type 2 diabetes. Additionally, two-way text messages, will be sent to study participants to rate their ability on selection of food and eating of healthy diet based on the messages received after every 4 weeks. The combination of the one-way and two-way messages in this in the intervention arm are designed to increase engagement of the participants.

The control group will continue receiving standard care in the hospitals. This group shall also receive clinic appointment reminder text messages one day prior to the actual date.

Quantitative data will be analyzed by the intention to treat principle.

NCT04094194,Meta-analysis of the Nordic Dietary Pattern on Cardiometabolic Risk and Cardiovascular Outcomes,Relation of the Nordic Dietary Pattern With Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Incident Cardiovascular Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Prospective Cohort Studies,"The Nordic Diet is a dietary pattern rich in traditional Nordic foods, including berries, grains, and fatty fish common in northern Europe. Studies have shown a protective effect of the Nordic Diet on cardiometabolic risk factors, however only select clinical practice guidelines for the management of diabetes (i.e. Diabetes Canada) recommend this dietary pattern. To support the update of the EASD clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and clinical trials to investigate the association between the Nordic Diet, cardiometabolic outcomes and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. The findings generated by this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing evidence-based guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.","Background: Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, a traditional dietary pattern of the wider region of the Mediterranean sea, has been associated with favourable cardiometabolic outcomes, including the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, limited local food availability, increased cost or unfamiliar culture and tradition render the Mediterranean diet difficult to follow in the northern European environment. The Nordic Diet or those of other traditional diets of the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Faeroe islands) are dietary patterns rich in traditional Nordic foods, including berries, grains, and fatty fish common in northern Europe. The Nordic Diet has been associated with favorable cardiometabolic outcomes including improved lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These benefits have been recognized in the most recent updates of the clinical practice guidelines for diabetes in Canada. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) has not included the Nordic dietary pattern in their guidelines.

Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts represent high-quality evidence to support dietary guidelines and public health policy. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted towards food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing the role of the Nordic diet in the prevention and management of cardiometabolic outcomes and cardiovascular diseases.

Objectives: To support the update of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts using the GRADE approach on the Nordic dietary pattern on cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies will be conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.

Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of references of included studies.

Study selection: Randomized controlled trials conducted in humans with a follow-duration ≥ 3 week investigating the effect of a Nordic diet on cardiometabolic outcomes will be included. Studies that are not conducted in humans, not randomized, have an acute feeding design (\<3 weeks), lack a suitable control (non-isocaloric) and/or do not report viable endpoint data will not be included. Prospective cohort studies with greater than 1-year of follow-up will be included.

Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized clinical trials and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for prospective cohorts. All disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data for the randomized clinical. Risk ratios, odds ratios and hazard ratios for clinical outcomes in the prospective cohort studies will be extracted or derived from clinical event data across exposure to a Nordic diet.

Outcomes: For the randomized clinical trials, the primary outcome will be LDL-cholesterol. Secondary outcomes will include markers of glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin); other blood lipids (non-HDL-C, apo B, HDL-C, triglycerides); adiposity (body weight, BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and inflammation (C-reactive protein \[CRP\]).

For prospective cohorts, the primary outcome will be incident CVD Secondary outcomes include incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and incident stroke.

Data synthesis:

Trials: Data will be pooled by the generic inverse-variance method with DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects models were used as they account for residual heterogeneity and yield more conservative estimates. Fixed-effects models will be used for \<5 trials. Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are ≥10 trials, we will explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by study design (parallel or crossover), follow-up duration (\<12 weeks or ≥12 weeks), comparator diet, baseline measurements, risk of bias, disease duration, and funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, diet quality index, composition of the background diet \[total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein\]). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When ≥10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

Prospective cohort studies: Natural log-transformed relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) of clinical outcomes, comparing extreme quantiles (the highest exposure versus the lowest exposure or reference group), will be pooled separately using the generic inverse variance method with random effects models and expressed as RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, we will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If ≥10 cohort comparisons were available, then we will perform an a-priori subgroup analyses by meta-regression for follow-up (\<10 years vs. ≥10 years), sex (males vs. females, males vs. mixed, females vs. mixed), study quality (NOS \<6 vs. ≥6) and funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses. Linear and non-linear dose-response relations will be explored with the use of random-effects generalised least-squares trend estimation (GLST) models and spline curve modeling (MKSPLINE procedure), respectively. When ≥10 studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

Evidence assessment: The certainty of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future guidelines.

Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation to the role of the Nordic Diet in cardiovascular disease prevention and management, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.",UNKNOWN,,2017-12-01,2019-12-01,2019-12-01,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1,ESTIMATED

NCT05147194,The Effects of TMZ on Diabetic Nephropathy,The Effects of Trimetazidine on Diabetic Nephropathy,"With the improvement of people's living standard, the prevalence of Diabetes is increasing year by year. In present, 350 million people worldwide are suffering from diabetes, and by 2035, there will be as high as 600 million. Diabetes causes a variety of complications, including diabetic nephropathy, which is one of the most common complications of Diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes. Microalbuminuria and glomerular filtration rate decrease are the main manifestation. Even more, it can progress to end-stage renal changes. Data showed that diabetic nephropathy accounts for about 40% of patients with end-stage renal disease receiving renal replacement therapy.

However, the treatment of diabetic nephropathy is still lacking. In the past 40 years, few drugs have been proven to ameliorate the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Even though, the renal function of a large number of diabetic nephropathy patients is gradually deteriorating. Therefore, it is urgent to find a therapeutic drug that acts on different targets.

Trimetazidine is a piperazine derivative. It is mainly used in the treatment of stable angina pectoris. Its safety has been well verified. In recent years, the role of trimetazidine in acute renal damage has been widely reported. A large number of studies have shown that trimetazidine can reduce the effect of contrast agent on renal function and reduce the incidence of contrast nephropathy. There fore, Trimetazidine is a promising drug for delaying the progression of diabetic nephropathy.","In the present study, there will be 2 groups last for 6 months.

NCT04790760,Glucose Differences Between the Left Arm and Right Arm in Diabetic Patients Using a Continuous Glucose Monitor,Glucose Differences Between the Left Arm and Right Arm in Diabetic Patients Using a Continuous Glucose Monitor,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an emerging field for diabetes management. CGMs are small devices primarily placed on a patient's upper arm that allow providers and patients to individualize therapy by looking at real time glucose levels. While the accuracy of these devices is extensively researched, there are no large-scale studies evaluating the differences between left and right arm glucose readings in the diabetic population. Additionally cinnamon and aloe vera are supplements commonly used by diabetic patients to help improve glycemic control. However, there remains a shortage of studies researching the effects of cinnamon and aloe vera on diabetic patients' glycemic control.

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference between glucose levels in the right arm and left arm in diabetic patients and to evaluate if cinnamon and aloe vera supplements impact glycemic control in diabetic patients.","Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an emerging field for diabetes management. CGMs allow providers to individualize therapy by looking at real time glucose levels, detect changes in glucose and raise awareness for hypo- and hyperglycemic events.\[1\] Some CGMs can be placed on the patient's arm to monitor glucose at regular intervals. The data is downloaded onto a reader where it can be viewed or sent to a computer for more in depth analysis. There are multiple Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CGM devices. The FDA considers a device to be accurate if 99% of glucose measurements are within 20% of lab results and if 95% of glucose measurements are within 15% of lab results.\[2\]

The accuracy and precision of CGMs is improving with increased use and advancement of the systems in use. CGM data has been deemed accurate for self use to adjust insulin dosage, detection of hypoglycemia and determining the clinical response to therapy.\[3\] However, CGMs are a new technology and while they have vastly improved since they originally came to market, there are still many concerns over their accuracy and ability to inform clinical treatment decisions.\[3\] An analysis conducted on the reports to the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database since 2015 revealed over 25,000 complaints of CGM inaccuracy.\[4\]

In the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2020 Guidelines on the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, it is stated that glycemic goals are achieved through glucose monitoring and, as such, self monitoring blood glucose is essential for reaching these goals.\[5\] CGMs are used to guide the treatment of diabetes including pharmacologic intervention, recommendations for hypoglycemia prevention and nutrition goals. The recommended time spent in range, time above range and time below range are also outlined in these guidelines.\[5\] The significance of time below range is associated with the risk of hypoglycemia. The more time spent below range is going to increase the chance of experiencing a hypoglycemic event which, if experienced, will have both negative physical and psychological effects on the person. In the most severe cases it can also lead to seizures, coma and death.\[5\] Increased time spent above range has been directly correlated with incidence and progression of microvascular complications associated with diabetes like retinopathy, neuropathy and kidney disease.\[5\] Time spent in range is also significant because in addition to informing treatment decisions, it has also been correlated to improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). In a recent analysis of 18 studies reporting paired HbA1c and time in range (%), it was found that for every 10% change in time in range, there was a corresponding 0.8% change in HbA1c.\[6\] This could mean that if a person spends 10% more time in range, their HbA1c may reduce up to 0.8%. This is significant since HbA1c is a gold standard marker of glycemic control in the diabetic population.\[5\]

Based on previous studies, the evaluation of CGM readings in the left and right arms of diabetic patients is needed. The information provided by CGMs outside of glucose levels such as time range information, hyper- or hypoglycemic glucose levels, and even immediate phone alerts for very low or very high readings in newer devices highlights the ever growing and critical role these devices play in the care of diabetic patients, and as such their accuracy and proper use is of the utmost importance.\[7\]

Cinnamon and aloe vera supplements are available over the counter and are used by consumers for many different ailments. Both cinnamon and aloe vera have been used for several centuries across many different cultures for a wide range of medicinal purposes. Diabetes is an example of one of the disease states commonly targeted by these two supplements. Patients with diabetes frequently consume cinnamon and aloe vera dietary supplements in an effort to improve their glycemic control. As research into the effects of these supplements has expanded, the understanding of their safety and practical uses has become better understood and is generally accepted.\[8,9\] There are many dietary supplements or food classified cinnamon and aloe vera based products on the market. Both cinnamon and aloe vera are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS status). However there is a lack of long term evaluation of the effects of these supplements in the diabetic patient population.

This study is a controlled, prospective trial that aims to evaluate the difference in glucose readings between the right arm and left arm using continuous glucose monitors in diabetic patients. In addition this study aims to evaluate the effect of cinnamon and aloe vera supplementation on glycemic control in diabetic patients.",UNKNOWN,,2021-03,2022-02,2022-02,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,OTHER,10,ESTIMATED

NCT01864460,Improving Autonomic Function and Balance in Diabetic Neuropathy,Improving Autonomic Function and Balance in Diabetic Neuropathy,"Type 2 diabetes (DM2) affects nearly 20 million people in the United States while impaired glucose regulation (IGR), which includes impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and early diabetes affects a considerably larger but unknown population group. At the current time there is no effective therapy to completely prevent, or reverse neuropathy associated with IGR and this represents a considerable challenge in rehabilitation. There is a particularly strong incentive to prevent IGT and related complications from advancing to DM2. IGR is a growing problem among all older adults and its strong association with many functional limitations, particularly mobility limitations, is not always recognized, even though diabetes-related disability occurs in up to 2/3 of older adults with diabetes and is associated with dependency, poor quality of life, and increased acute and long-term care utilization.

Autonomic dysfunction is a significant problem in subjects with IGT. The Preliminary Data shows that over 90% of subjects with IGT have an abnormal score on questionnaires about autonomic symptoms such as lightheadedness, dry mouth or dry eyes, pale or blue feet, feet that are colder than the rest of the body, decreased sweating in the feet or increased sweating in the hands, nausea or bloating after eating, persistent diarrhea or constipation, or leaking of urine. In addition, patients with IGR have impaired balance control. These factors can increase the risk of falls in affected subjects. A non-randomized and non-controlled study showed that a diet and exercise intervention in patients with diabetes led to an overall improvement in autonomic function. Furthermore, it was shown that standing balance can be improved with a balance intervention program.

However, there are no published studies that assess the effect of an intense physical activity intervention on autonomic function in IGR related neuropathy. This study will test an aerobic exercise and balance intervention in participants with IGR. The investigators will examine if an individually tailored, carefully monitored, Diet, Physical Activity, and Balance Enhancement Program (DPAEP) can improve autonomic function and balance control when compared to patients who receive standard care. Improving balance control and autonomic function can decrease the risk of falls and have a significant effect on the health of participants.

The research is also significant because it will test subjects either before they become diabetic, or at an early stage in their diabetes, thus enhancing the chance of reversing the autonomic neuropathy or balance impairment. Furthermore, the study is designed to test whether improvement in autonomic function and balance is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes, quality of life, and the metabolic state of participants. Thus, the proposed interventions are likely to have a real life impact on participants and their health.","Study on hold due to COVID-19

In this proposed study, investigators will determine if an intense, individually tailored, carefully monitored, Diet, Physical Activity and Balance Enhancement Program (DPAEP) can improve autonomic function and balance and other measures of autonomic and balance control. In contrast, the primary and secondary and other efficacy measures will be compared in standard care controls (SC) who will receive general diet and physical activity information. The ""Improving Autonomic Function and Balance in Diabetic Neuropathy"" study is a single blinded, randomized study to determine if an intensive diet and exercise program improves autonomic function and balance. Following baseline testing, participants are randomized to either DPAEP or SC groups.

NCT00005760,"Health Effects of Liposuction in Overweight Women With Elevated Insulin Levels, Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes","A Pilot Study of the Metabolic Effects of Large Volume Liposuction in Overweight Women With Hyperinsulinemia, Impaired Glucose Tolerance and/or Type 2 Diabetes","This study is for women who have already decided to undergo liposuction at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. To take part in this study, a woman must first meet with the plastic surgeons there, and be accepted by them to have liposuction. This study will investigate whether large volume liposuction improves risk factors for heart disease in overweight women with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or elevated blood insulin levels. Large volume liposuction is the surgical removal of at least 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of body fat, usually from the abdomen, hips or chest. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure and elevated levels of blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), blood glucose (sugar), and blood insulin. Subjects who participate in all parts of this study will receive a total of $930.00.

Overweight women 18 years or older with high blood insulin levels, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes, who are planning to have large volume liposuction performed at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., may be eligible for this study. For a subject to be accepted into this study, she must first meet with the plastic surgeons at Georgetown University Medical Center, and they have to agree to perform large volume liposuction. The decision that someone is suitable for liposuction is not under the control of the NIH or of any NIH investigator.

Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures at four separate times - before undergoing liposuction, 4 weeks after surgery, 4 months after surgery and 1 year after surgery:

* Body measurements - taken with calipers to measure several skinfold thicknesses (the width of a fat fold) and with a tape measure to measure the circumference of parts of the body.
* Urine sample and 6-hour urine collection - to test for pregnancy and to evaluate kidney function.
* Glucose tolerance test - measures insulin sensitivity and how the body uses sugar, how well insulin works, and insulin sensitivity. The procedure involves placement of two catheters (thin, flexible tubes) through a needle into a vein in each arm. Sugar water is infused into one catheter and 20 minutes into the test a small amount of insulin is injected. Blood samples are drawn from the other catheter at frequent intervals for a total of 5 hours.
* Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography - measure the heart's electrical activity and function.
* Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan - produces images for measuring body fat in the abdomen. (not done at the 4-week visit). Takes about half an hour to complete.
* DXA X-ray - measures body fat, muscle and bone mineral content. Takes about half an hour to complete.
* Bod Pod - capsule-like device used to determine the proportion of body weight composed of fat and non-fat tissue. Takes less than 10 minutes
* Bioelectric impedance analysis device - measures the proportions of body fat based on electrical conduction of a small electric current. Takes 2-3 minutes.
* 24-hour blood pressure monitoring - a device attached to a blood pressure cuff strapped to the arm measures blood pressure every 15 to 30 minutes continuously for 24 hours.
* Vascular reactivity tests - a blood pressure cuff is inflated for about 4 minutes before deflating, providing information on the function of the small blood vessels in the skin, as well as an idea of the function level of small blood vessels elsewhere in the body. Takes half an hour.
* Blood samples - collected to evaluate kidney and liver function and to measure body lipids, such as cholesterol, minerals, and other substances.","Obesity is a major predisposing factor for future Type 2 diabetes because it is often associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance has been suggested as the common link for other aspects of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome that includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and macrovascular arterial disease. There are racial disparities in the prevalence of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes: Compared with non-Hispanic Caucasians, African American women have almost twice the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.

Because data from predominantly Caucasian populations suggest that the quantity of truncal (sometimes called upper body) adipose tissue, which includes the adipose tissue surrounding the abdominal viscera, is far more important for risk stratification than that found in the limbs or buttocks, which contain subcutaneous adipose tissue, it has been presumed that attempts at treatment of obesity should concentrate on reducing visceral fat. However, despite their greater risks for the complications of obesity, African Americans have less visceral abdominal adipose tissue than Caucasians matched for body weight. Further, recent metabolic studies suggest that upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue may play a significant role, particularly for African Americans, in the comorbid metabolic conditions associated with obesity.

With the advent of the large volume liposuction technique, selective removal of substantial quantities of subcutaneous adipose tissue has become possible. It is unknown whether the complications of obesity can be ameliorated by removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but one preliminary study suggests that fasting hyperinsulinism can be improved by this approach.

We propose to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients (five Caucasians and five African-Americans) who plan to undergo liposuction. We will investigate how large volume liposuction affects the metabolic complications of obesity in overweight patients who have hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes. We will investigate the effects of liposuction on various indices of the cardiac dysmetabolic syndrome by performing studies of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism at four time points: before large volume liposuction, 1 month after liposuction, 4 months after liposuction, and 1 year after liposuction. At each visit we will study body composition, blood pressure, cardiac function, dietary habits, insulin insensitivity, free fatty acids, and lipid profiles.",COMPLETED,,2000-05,2002-01,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,10,

Language barriers, the lack of self-confidence, and diminished social support that accompany the acculturation process prevent KAI from improving their health-seeking behaviors. Our previous research has indicated that overwhelming numbers of KAI suffer not only from uncontrolled hyperglycemia but also from a loss of self-confidence and social isolation because of language and cultural barriers. They are in urgent need of an intervention to assist them in their efforts to achieve better glycemic control and restore their self-confidence in diabetes and health management so that they are able to adjust successfully in this new environment. Therefore, The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-tailored, comprehensive behavioral intervention program specially designed for linguistically challenged KAIs with type 2 DM.

This pilot project will test the hypothesis: Compared to KAI in the control group, KAI with type 2 DM who receive a comprehensive DM management intervention through structured psycho-behavioral education, home glucose monitoring with a telephone transmission system, and interaction with a bilingual nurse case manager will show: (1) a greater level of glucose control; and (2) a greater level of self-help skills including knowledge related to glucose control, problem-solving skills, heightened confidence and mood/affect, adherence to treatment recommendations, and quality of life.

T1DM is well known for as the consequence of selective destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells within the islets of Langerhans. Basically, autoimmune reactions against beta cells may come from activation of the immune system in genetically susceptible individuals triggered by environmental factors that bear epitopes similar to those expressed by the beta cells. Several mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, metabolic stress on beta cells, cryptic epitope exposure and costimulatory molecule upregulation have been proposed but none of them could be solely responsible for the pathogenesis of T1DM. Recently, T1DM has been considered a consequence of dysregulated or over-activation of immune responses in genetically predisposed individuals, similar to other autoimmune diseases.

The rapid increase in the incidence of T1DM in developed countries including Taiwan during recent decades refers to the role of environmental factors in this disease. Candidate environmental factors influencing T1DM include various microbial and food components encountered at mucosal surfaces as well as gut mucosal parameters such as gut permeability. However, difficulty exists in characterizing the environmental factors and mechanisms in T1DM because of their complexity of interaction, the long lag period between the induction of disease trigger factors and the clinical onset of the disease. Environmental factors in T1DM seem to prevent full penetration of the disease rather than trigger it. It had been reported that high diabetes incidence in germ-free mice and an involvement of innate immune mechanisms in the disease. In this study, investigators try to administer probiotics (Lactobacillus salivarius + Lactobacillus johnsonii + Bifidobacterium lactis from glac biotech Co., Ltd.) to children T1DM patients for 6 months to see if the inhibition effect of T1DM animal model could be discerned in a short-term period from both change of serum cytokines and beta cells insulin secretion ability.

NCT02250794,Metformin and Sitagliptin Therapy for Adult Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Admitted to the General Medical Unit,Metformin and Sitagliptin Therapy for Adult Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Admitted to the General Medical Unit,"The purpose of this study is to test whether a combination of two pills commonly used to treat outpatient diabetes called metformin and sitagliptin (januvia) could provide successful control of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes during hospitalization for the treatment of a general medical condition. Both metformin and sitagliptin are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but little experience exists for their use in hospitalized patients. The current standard practice is to use insulin injections to control blood sugar in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. This study will compare the use of metformin tablets twice per day along with sitagliptin tablets once per day with daily insulin injections in patients with type 2 diabetes during hospitalization, and will study how well the blood sugar levels are controlled.","We propose a trial to evaluate whether in-hospital glycemic control, as measured by mean daily glucose concentration and frequency of hypoglycemic events, is different between treatment with metformin and sitagliptin combination and treatment with glargine insulin once daily and rapid-acting insulin analog with meals in patients with type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization and increased complications such as infection (1). Consensus guidelines recommend long-acting basal insulin and meal-time bolus insulin therapy for inpatient blood glucose management. These basal bolus regimens are labor intensive, require multiple injections each day, and can cause hypoglycemia. A study at our institution of patients admitted to the hospital and treated with our basal bolus insulin protocol found the incidence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose less than 70 mg/dl) to be 20% of all patient stays (2). A strategy for inpatient blood glucose management with less risk of hypoglycemia is needed.

We propose a trial of the use of two oral medications metformin and sitagliptin that lower blood sugar without the risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is first-line therapy for outpatient management of type 2 diabetes. It has long-standing evidence of safety and efficacy. It decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin-mediated glucose utilization in the muscle and the liver. A Cochrane Review of 29 trials of metformin as monotherapy compared with other oral agents, insulin, diet, or placebo showed a reduction in cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality with metformin (3).

Sitagliptin is a Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor approved by the FDA as monotherapy or in combination with metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin and sitagliptin are active within 24 hours of initiation and do not cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin works by slowing the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 stimulates glucose dependent secretion of endogenous insulin with meals.

A recent preliminary study supports the use of sitagliptin for inpatient glucose management. This trial included 90 patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to general medicine and surgery services. It randomized patients to one of three groups: sitagliptin alone, sitagliptin plus long-acting insulin (glargine), or a basal bolus insulin regimen. The study selected for patients with mild to moderate diabetes by including only patients with diabetes controlled by diet alone, any combination of oral antidiabetic agents, or a total daily insulin dose ≤ 0.4 units/kg prior to admission. Patients were eligible if their blood sugar was 140 - 400 mg/dl. Patients in all three groups received supplemental (correction) doses of rapid-acting insulin before meals and bedtime for blood glucose \>140 mg/dL. Glycemic control improved similarly in all treatment groups, but 100% of the patients in the sitagliptin alone group required one or more injections of rapid-acting insulin to correct hyperglycemia (4). This result suggests that sitagliptin alone is insufficient therapy for treating hyperglycemia in this population. We will recruit a similar population of patients, and we will add metformin for improved blood sugar control. Our sitagliptin and metformin group will not receive supplemental doses of rapid-acting insulin as the purpose of this trial is to evaluate a regimen without the risk of hypoglycemia.

Metformin is safe in patients with adequate renal function. The current prescribing information for metformin is that its use is permitted with a serum creatinine ≤ 1.4 mg/dL in women and ≤ 1.5 mg/dL in men which is equivalent to a GFR ≥ 60 ml/min (5). It is excreted by the kidneys and therefore can potentially accumulate in patients with renal failure. Metformin works by inhibiting gluconeogenesis-a process that utilizes lactic acid to produce glucose. Thus, with accumulation of this medication, it could predispose patients to lactic acidosis. The incidence of lactic acidosis with metformin is extremely low. A systematic review of 347 randomized trials and prospective cohort studies representing 70,490 patient-years of metformin use and 55,451 patient-years in the non-metformin group revealed no cases of lactic acidosis. Almost half of the studies allowed inclusion of patients with a serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dL, and 97% of the studies allowed inclusion of patients with at least one contraindication to metformin therapy (6). Another trial evaluated the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin in 393 patients with renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine levels of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/dl (mean level 1.8 mg/dl) and found no cases of lactic acidosis over four years of the trial duration (7).

Most cases of lactic acidosis in patients taking metformin have been associated with shock or other tissue hypoxia. Elevated lactate in these patients may not be related to metformin. This is supported by the fact that lactic acidosis occurs as frequently in metformin users as users of other anti-diabetes medications (8). Also, metformin levels do not correlate with lactate levels or mortality suggesting that the underlying disease is more likely the cause of the acidosis than metformin (9). However this theoretical concern for an exceedingly rare complication has excluded metformin from use in hospitalized patients.

The recognition of the rarity of lactic acidosis among users of metformin with renal insufficiency has changed recommendations to allow for its use in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Current guidelines use an estimated GFR (eGFR) which is a more accurate approximation of renal function than serum creatinine. The current recommendation of the American Diabetes Association states that metformin can be used at full doses (2000 mg/day) as long as eGFR \> 45 ml/min and serum creatinine is monitored. If the eGFR is \< 45ml/min, then a maximal dose of 1000 mg/day is advised, with serum creatinine monitoring. Metformin should not be used if the eGFR is \< 30 ml/min (10).

The American College of Radiology has recently updated their guidelines for the use of metformin in patients receiving IV contrast media (11). A prior guideline recommended holding metformin for 4 days surrounding IV contrast administration to evaluate for contrast-induced acute kidney injury. This guideline contributed to the practice of discontinuing metformin during hospitalization due to the commonness of radiology studies using IV contrast. There is no drug interaction between metformin and contrast media nor is there any effect of metformin on renal function. Given the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury is very low in patients with normal renal function and no co-morbidities, the revised (2013) American College of Radiology guidelines recommend that metformin can be continued without the need to evaluate renal function following contrast media. In the presence of co-morbidities that increase the risk for developing acidosis (liver dysfunction, alcohol abuse, heart failure, myocardial or peripheral muscle ischemia, sepsis or severe infection), the new guidelines recommend holding metformin for two days after IV contrast administration. Our study will only include patients without these co-morbidities and with normal renal function (eGFR \> 60 ml/min). All subjects will have serum creatinine measured daily, and metformin will be discontinued in the event of acute kidney injury.

Since metformin is safe and effective for glucose management in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, we propose its continuation during hospitalization. This study will include adult patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with metformin alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents including low dose insulin. All subjects will have normal renal function (eGFR\>60 ml/min) and no comorbidities that increase the risk for acidosis. This prospective, randomized controlled trial will compare metformin and sitagliptin (which cannot cause hypoglycemia) to usual insulin therapy, which is known to cause hypoglycemia. This study has possible implications for improving the safety of therapy for hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.",WITHDRAWN,No subjects enrolled.,2014-10,2015-05,2015-05,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,0,ACTUAL

NCT04283994,Project to Improve Communication About Serious Illness--Hospital Study: Comparative Effectiveness Trial (Trial 2),Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients With Serious Illness,"The objective of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of a Jumpstart intervention on patient-centered outcomes for patients with chronic illness by ensuring that they receive care that is concordant with their goals over time, and across settings and providers. This study is particularly interested in understanding the effect of the intervention to improve quality of palliative care for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) but will also include other common chronic, life-limiting illnesses.

The specific aims are:

1. To evaluate the efficacy of the EHR-based clinician-facing Jumpstart, drawn from the electronic medical record (EHR), the survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart, drawn from patient or family completed surveys, and usual care for improving quality of care provided to patients with chronic illness experiencing a hospitalization. The primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion, assessed from randomization through 30 days. Secondary outcomes include: a) intensity of care outcomes (e.g., ICU use, ICU and hospital free days, hospital readmissions, costs of hospital care); and b) patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 3-5 days and 4-6 weeks after randomization, including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care discussions in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, and quality of life.
2. To conduct a mixed-methods evaluation of the implementation of the interventions, guided by the RE-AIM and CFIR frameworks for implementation science, incorporating quantitative evaluation of the interventions' reach and adoption, as well as qualitative analyses of interviews with participants, to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.","OVERVIEW: Jumpstart is a communication-priming intervention for clinicians, patients and their families that focuses on hospitalized patients' goals of care. In this comparative effectiveness trial, the investigators examine the effectiveness of two approaches designed to promote goals-of-care discussions for older, seriously ill, hospitalized patients recruited from three UW Medicine hospitals. The two approaches include a survey-based bi-directional intervention and an EHR-based clinician-facing intervention. Both of these interventions provide clinicians with Jumpstart Guides that include data selected from the EHR on advance care planning as well as tips designed to improve communication about patients' goals of care and care preferences. Additionally, the survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart includes not only the EHR-based care planning information but also communication tips that are based on specific information from patients' (or surrogates) self-reported surveys. These bi-directional Jumpstarts are shared not only with clinicians but also with participating patients and families. The Jumpstart Guide is provided by email and in-person. This trial tests the comparative effectiveness of the survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart, the EHR-based clinician-facing Jumpstart and usual care. Unique to this trial is the use of the EHR to identify eligible participants, provide data for the intervention, and be the mechanism for delivering the intervention.

This current study is ""Trial 2"" of the R01 Award funding this trial. Trial 1 was completed prior to the initiation of Trial 2.

SPECIFIC AIM 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of the survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart compared to the EHR-based clinician-facing Jumpstart and usual care for improving quality of care.

TRIAL 2 has four components.

Component 1- Subject Identification/Recruitment/Randomization: Patients who meet the inclusion criteria are screened and identified using daily screening reports and staff review. The investigators oversample patients with ADRD to include 40% of the sample. Patients are approached by study staff in person during their hospital stay to assess their interest in participating in the study. Recruitment conversations are designed to take place in the patient's hospital room. Subjects are asked to complete surveys at three time points: 1) at enrollment; 2) 3-5 days after randomization; and 3) 4-6 weeks after randomization. Follow-up surveys may be completed in-person, by paper, online, or by phone, based on respondents' preferences.

If patients are not able to participate themselves (e.g., cognitive impairment, sedated or ventilated), the investigators recruit their legal surrogate decision-maker to participate. This surrogate (under Washington State Law RCW 7.70.065) provides consent on their own behalf and is a research study subject.

Eligible patients are assigned to one of the three interventions in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients are randomized using variable size blocks and stratified for hospital and ADRD vs. no ADRD. Surrogates/families follow the randomization status of the patients whom they are representing.

Component 2- EHR-based clinician-facing Jumpstart guide: The Jumpstart guide is developed from an automated review of the EHR. It summarizes the presence/absence of POLST, advance directives and DPOA documentation. It provides general recommendations to assist clinicians in initiating goals of care discussions.

Component 3- Survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart Guide: Survey data, completed by patients or their surrogate/family at enrollment provide assessments of the following: a) preferences for discussions about goals of care; b) most important barrier and facilitator for having such discussions; and c) current goals of care. These elements are contained within the Jumpstart guides and the information is tailored to each recipient (i.e., patient, surrogate/family, or clinician). This version provides survey-response specific recommendations to initiate goals of care discussions.

Component 4- Delivery of the intervention:

Clinician delivery: Guides are delivered within the first few days (1-3) after randomization to the primary clinician team (attending and resident physicians and advanced practice providers) via secure email or in person. Study staff monitor the care team for the patient and ensure that any new providers also receive the Jumpstart guide.

Patient and family delivery: For the survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart arm, study staff provide the patient or surrogate with a version of the Jumpstart guide, tailored to be appropriate for patients or their surrogates (without information on EHR-based advance care planning documents) and following the same timeframe. Jumpstart guides are delivered to the patient or surrogate/family at the hospital.

Comparison group: We will compare all 3 arms (survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart, EHR-based clinician-facing Jumpstart, usual care) in three two-way comparisons.

Outcome Assessment: The primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion in the 30 days following randomization. All subjects are asked to complete questionnaires at enrollment. The questionnaires may be completed as computer-assisted interviews or on-line depending on the subject's preference. The study staff member enrolling the subjects notifies them of their randomization status at this time. Subjects randomized to the survey-based bi-directional Jumpstart arm complete additional questionnaire items used to create the Jumpstart Guide.

The research staff will contact all subjects in person (or by telephone or email) for the evaluation/post-intervention phase. Patient and surrogate/family subjects will complete surveys at 3-5 days and 4-6 weeks after randomization. Surveys can be completed by telephone, mail, or online; we will contact each patient or family/surrogate at each interval using their preferred modality. Subjects may complete the surveys with study staff in person (if the patient is still in the hospital), over the phone, online using REDCap, or on paper and return via mail. Surrogate/Family subjects will complete the same measures at the same intervals as patients with a few exceptions: families will complete the SF-1 for themselves as well as by proxy for patients.

Follow up contacts for subjects at 3-5 days follow-up will be as follows: If the patient is still hospitalized, in-person contact will be attempted (surrogates, who may not be reachable in person, may be contacted by their preferred mode); otherwise, contact will be attempted via phone, email, or mail per the subject's preference. Second and third contact attempts will be made using the subject's preferred mode 2 and 4 days later (7 and 14 days later for mail).

Follow-up contacts for subjects at 4-6 weeks follow-up will be as follows: initial contact by subject's preferred mode at 4 weeks from enrollment, followed by 4 additional contacts at an interval of every 4-7 days for phone and online, and an interval of every 7-10 days for mail. In all cases, only non-respondents will continue to be contacted.

For surrogates of patients who have died, after a minimum of 4 weeks following the patient death, an ""after death"" questionnaire will be sent to the subject using their preferred mode. The after-death questionnaire includes items related to treatment preferences, psychological distress (HADS), and health-related quality of life (SF1). The after-death questionnaire will be sent one time with no additional follow-ups.

At the end of study participation, study staff will collect additional information from the patient's electronic health record including intensity of care outcomes. Data will be abstracted using automated EHR data collection and ""gold standard"" manual abstraction using standardized methods for training and quality control.

Secondary outcomes also include the following patient- and surrogate/family-reported outcomes assessed by survey at 3-5 days and 4-6 weeks after randomization: occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal concordant care, psychological symptoms, and quality of life.

SPECIFIC AIM 2: Evaluate the factors affecting the Jumpstart intervention implementation and identify barriers and facilitators to future implementation.

Patient and Surrogate/Family Subject Identification and Recruitment: Included in the patient's and surrogate/family member's consent form is a provision informing subjects that they may be contacted at the end of their study involvement to take part in a short, semi-structured interview to evaluate their study participation. Subjects will be sampled purposively to represent the following experiences: 1) participants from both intervention arms (EHR-based and survey-based); 2) participants who participated in the intervention fully as well as those who did not to better understand the reasons for less than full participation. ""Full"" participation is indicated by having completed all of the study materials.

Clinician Subject Identification and Recruitment: Study staff will recruit clinicians who were involved with the study to participate in a short interview after the clinician's study involvement with the enrolled patient has ended.

All interview participants will be selected using purposive sampling to ensure a diverse group (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, gender, specialty, year of training) in addition to the characteristics noted above.

Interview: Using an interview guide developed specifically for this project, interviewers will assess respondents' experience with the intervention and gather suggestions for ways to improve the intervention's content, delivery, and implementation, including implementation outcomes (e.g., acceptability, fidelity, penetration, maintenance) that will guide future dissemination of the intervention.

Assessment: Interviews are audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Validity and reliability are assessed by co-coding approaches.",COMPLETED,,2021-07-26,2025-01-27,2023-12-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,756,ACTUAL

The investigators will try to amiliorate the complexity of hypogliceamic treatment in a little group of older patients with type 2 diabetes reducing the number of pills and/or insulin administration using a single daily dose of a fixed combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide. This therapeutic semplification will be done indipendently of pre-existent glicaemic control.,"Older patients with type 2 diabetes often have numerous coexisting medical problems for which these subjets prescribed multiple medications. Actually, diabetes, hyertension, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), digestive and respiratory disorders are common in aged peolple and tend to coexist. Unfortunally, the complex therapy of these diseases increases the risk of adverse drug events. Furthermore, there is marked heterogeneity in health status and functional capacity in older diabetic subjects, often making prescribing decisions complex and challenging. On the other hand, despite of the use of many medicines, undertreatment is also frequent present in the elderly and the probability of underprescription increased significantly with the number of medicines.Both conditions have a detrimental effect on quality of life (QoL) of elderly subjects increasing the risk of disability and death. Therefore, older people should benefit greatly of a simplification of drug regimens and reduction of pill burdens as well as better explanations of the reason for the prescriptions. The combination of insulin degludec (100 units/mL) and liraglutide (3.6 mg/mL), termed IDegLira, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral glucose-lowering agents alone or in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or basal insulin (European indication). Interestingly, RCTs and real-world evidence provided insights into effectiveness and safety in routine clinical practice. However, beyond its known metabolic efficacy IDegLira has a very small hypoglicaemic rate, with a single daily and flexible administration dose and a very good safety profile that makes it suitable for fragile diabetic old patients.",COMPLETED,,2018-11-19,2021-03-25,2019-11-22,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,35,ACTUAL
NCT04125160,Glycaemic Markers in Persons With Type 2 Diabetes on Peritoneal Dialysis,Markers for Glycaemic Control and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Persons With Type 2 Diabetes on Peritoneal Dialysis,"The aim is to investigate the correlation between mean glucose measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and mean glucose estimated from glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in persons with type 2 diabetes undergoing peritoneal dialysis compared with patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function. Furthermore, the aim is to compare CGM and HbA1c with glycated albumin and fructosamine.","Background:

In persons with type 2 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used as an indirect measure of the mean glucose over the past 3-4 months. The normal range of HbA1c and the correlation to the mean glucose has been determined from studies in subjects without severe chronic kidney disease.

In persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and type 2 diabetes, HbA1c has been shown in small studies to underestimate mean glucose when compared with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or alternative glycaemic markers such as glycated albumin or fructosamine. The cause of a falsely low HbA1c in persons with ESRD and diabetes is not clear, but adjuvant erythropoietin treatment and iron infusion increase erythropoiesis, thus increasing the number of new non-glycated erythrocytes that are thought to lower HbA1c. Furthermore, the erythrocyte life span was found to be decreased in individuals receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, which may also contribute to a reduction in HbA1c.

CGM is an alternative to HbA1c in glycaemic monitoring and measures interstitial glucose that calibrates with blood glucose within minutes. CGM measures interstitial glucose every five minutes for up to eight days (Medtronic's Ipro2). Studies of persons with type 1 diabetes and CGM measurements performed over three months showed that approximately two-weeks of CGM measurements correlated to HbA1c. When CGM was performed beyond 14 days, the correlation between the mean glucose from CGM and HbA1c improved only modestly.

Values of CGM measurements also provide a basis for monitoring glycaemic variability, time-in-range and hypoglycaemic episodes. For persons with diabetes undergoing peritoneal dialysis, there are only a few studies validating HbA1c and none have been prospective with a control group over a long period of time. A retrospective study of 60 persons with diabetes and in peritoneal dialysis (without control group) found a significant correlation between HbA1c and mean interstitial glucose as measured by CGM (r = 0.48, P≤0.0001). A prospective study of 25 persons with diabetes and in peritoneal dialysis (without control group) also found a significant correlation (r = 0.51, P≤0.01). A study of three persons with diabetes and in peritoneal dialysis (without control group) found that HbA1c compared to CGM underestimated mean glucose in one, but overestimated mean glucose in the other two. However, all three studies did not include a control group and had few days of CGM measurements, which collectively mean that the evidence for the use of HbA1c in this patient group is sparse.

In a study of peritoneal dialysis subjects with diabetic nephropathy (n = 1296), 17.7% had normal HbA1c and were without antidiabetic treatment. When the same study included glycated albumin, 10.9% were found to have normal HbA1c, normal glycated albumin (defined as less than 16%) and were without antidiabetic medication. The study concluded that normal HbA1c alone overestimates the prevalence of burnt-out diabetes.

The uncertainty associated with HbA1c in persons with type 2 diabetes undergoing peritoneal dialysis is a problem both in terms of diagnosing and treating diabetes appropriately. CGM, glycated albumin and fructosamine are independent of erythrocyte turnover thus allowing for a validation of HbA1c in this group of patients.

Objective:

To investigate the correlation between mean glucose measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and mean glucose estimated from glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in persons with type 2 diabetes undergoing peritoneal dialysis compared with a control group of persons with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function.

Method:

Prospective case-control study over 16 days with 26 persons in each group. The case group consist of persons with type 2 diabetes undergoing peritoneal dialysis and the control group consists of persons with type 2 diabetes with normal renal function (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 60 ml/min and urine albumin-creatinine ratio below 300mg/g). CGM is performed for a maximum of 16 days. On visit 1 (day 0), CGM is performed for 8 days and visit 2 (day 8) (+7/-4 days), CGM is performed for another 8 days. Glycaemic markers are measured at baseline and on visit 3 (final day of the study). At least 12 days of CGM must be completed for each person. Data is collected using REDcap.

Statistics:

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the ratio between the two groups measured as mean glucose concentration measured over 16 days at CGM (mmol / L) divided by the estimated glucose concentration from HbA1c (mmol / L) measured at day 16.

The alternative hypothesis is that there is a 17% difference between groups for the ratio of mean glucose concentration measured by CGM (mmol / L) divided by the mean glucose concentration from HbA1c (mmol / L). In a pilot study of persons with type 2 diabetes and dialysis dependent ESRD compared with persons with normal renal function, a 17% difference was found in the ratio between the two groups. In a two-sided unpaired t-test with α = 0.05, SD = 1.17 and power of 90%, a sample size of 24 individuals in each group will show a significant difference. A drop of approximately 10% is expected and a total of 26 are included in each group.",COMPLETED,,2019-11-12,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,54,ACTUAL

NCT04199676,Immediate Postpartum Glucose Tolerance Testing,Immediate Postpartum Glucose Tolerance Testing Among Gestational Diabetics: A Comparison to the Gold Standard,The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of a 2hr glucose tolerance test administered during the postpartum hospitalization with the standard of care glucose tolerance testing (administered at 6 weeks postpartum). The primary hypothesis is that the glucose tolerance test administered in the postpartum period will be accurate and will improve compliance with postpartum testing for gestational diabetics.,"Gestational diabetes affects approximately 5-10% of pregnancies and its prevalence continues to increase as rates of obesity and metabolic disease increase in reproductive age women. Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes carry an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life, even if their glucose tolerance initially normalizes following delivery.

The gold standard assessment of glucose tolerance postpartum is a two hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) that is completed between six and twelve weeks' postpartum. Unfortunately, the compliance rate with this test is low, ranging from 30 - 50% by most reports. As a result, a large number of women with glucose intolerance are missed due to noncompliance with postpartum testing, thereby forfeiting the opportunity for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of longterm health consequences. The postpartum hospital stay provides a unique opportunity to increase compliance with glucose tolerance testing due to an increased rate of patient capture. However, it is unknown if administration of a glucose tolerance test in the immediate postpartum period would adequately identify women with persistent glucose intolerance.

The current study aims to provide data towards the accuracy of an immediate postpartum GTT in a population of women with gestational diabetes and provide follow-up data on women with abnormal testing.",RECRUITING,,2020-09-01,2026-12-31,2026-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,300,ESTIMATED

   * to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes in a BC First Nation community
   * to determine the utility of community based screening by examining how many positively screened people follow up with the recommended subsequent testing and family physician visit
   * to determine if point-of-care HbA1c test (Ames/Bayer DCA 2000) correlates with the confirmatory fasting and 2 hour post challenge blood glucose tests.
2. Hypothesis The Point-of-Care test will correlate well with the gold standard diagnostic tests and prove to be a useful tool for community-based screening. This test obviates the need for fasting and repeat glucose tolerance testing.","This is a screening for prevalence study.

The Seabird Island Band's health department serves a large catchment area of approximately 3000 First Nation members. The team of physicians, nurses, and technicians will invite communities to participate in diabetes screening events. In conjunction with the community health workers, we will be facilitating diabetes awareness in the community through the provision of large scale screening Two types of events will be held. An initial ""Open House"" event and a second event in the form of an afternoon ""Diabetes Awareness"" event later in the year.

With the assistance of community leaders and the Seabird Island Health Unit staff, we will utilize materials such as posters and flyers available from the Health unit both to increase awareness of diabetes and to advise of the awareness/screening events. For the Community Event there will be a community dinner served at the end of the afternoon for all who attended.

Community members of Seabird Island will be invited for screening through posters hung in gathering spaces and high traffic areas. Notices will be put in the community newsletter.

They will be given information about the screening study and will give informed consent by way of a formal consent form. If younger than 18, consent will be obtained from parents or guardians. Identity will be concealed by using study numbers for individuals; a master list linking names and PHNs to the study numbers will be kept by the Seabird Island lead for the study at Seabird Island in a locked cabinet in a locked office. Primary and Co-investigators will receive only anonymized data. This is the wish of the community and is in keeping with OCAP principles.

Tests and Procedure:

Point of care (finger poke) HbA1c using Ames/Bayer DCA 2000 POC analyzer system will be used for screening.

1. If the A1c test result is \< 6%: Will be offered to have a fasting and 2 hour after glucose drink test (OGTT) the next day. Otherwise will be counseled to follow up in one year with their Primary Care Physician or attend another screening opportunity
2. If A1c result is 6-6.5: Given lab requisition for fasting blood sugar and HbA1c and 2 hour after glucose drink test (OGTT). Advised to get follow up blood work tomorrow (in some cases this will be available in the community) and advised to see their family physician. If the family physician is not a Seabird physician, a letter will be sent to the physician informing him of the screening event and the screening results. Counseled about health promotion and diabetes and meaning of A1c result.
3. If A1c result is \>6.5: Counseled that they may have diabetes. Given requisition to obtain a fasting and two hour post glucose drink test (OGTT) tomorrow and advised to see their family physician. Counseled about health promotion and diabetes and meaning of A1c result.

If history of gestational diabetes and not retested - given requisition for 75 g OGTT and counseled to follow up with family physician. If the family physician is not a Seabird physician, a letter will be sent to the physician informing him of the screening event and the screening results. Counseled about health promotion and diabetes and meaning of A1c result.

If blood pressure \> 140/90 - counseled to follow up with family physician. If the family physician is not a Seabird physician, a letter will be sent to the physician informing him of the screening event and the screening results.

The Seabird lead will be notified of the blood results and record them along with the screening results. Anonymized data will be forwarded to the investigative team. We recognize that a small proportion of the sample (approximately 15%) that have non-Seabird physicians may not have follow-up data available.

All participants will have received information regarding diet, lifestyle, and diabetes prevention. They will also be given general counseling regarding the role of balance in health, and the fact that the traditional medicine wheel identifies Physical, Spiritual, Mental and Emotional aspects of health that affect blood glucose levels.

Estimates will be made (based on this sample of the population) about how many people have undiagnosed diabetes in this community, that is the number not known to have self-reported diabetes but who have an A1c test \>6.5%. Specifically, if the A1c test is greater than 6.5% this is considered diagnostic of diabetes (by current American Diabetes Association standards) This will be compared to the number who have diabetes based on a fasting glucose \> 7 mmol/L and/or 2 hour post glucose drink blood glucose test \> 11 mmol/L on follow up testing (by current Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines) As well, comparison of the reverse will be made, namely those with elevated fasting and/or post glucose drink values but who had normal A1c values (\<6.5%)

Additional outcomes:

1. Did the clients who were counseled to do so actually obtain the follow-up blood tests? (Historically, such patients often decline to obtain the tests requested).
2. Were all the follow-up blood tests performed? How many declined one or more of these tests, specifically the 2 hour post glucose drink test which is often refused).
3. Did the formal tests correlate to the POC HbA1c test or was there significant discrepancy? Thus is this test for diagnosing diabetes confirmed as a valid test for screening in First Nation Communities in Canada?
4. By one month post screening survey, how what percentage of family physicians found this useful?

Follow up information will be obtained and analyzed:

1. Dr. Fox (main Seabird physician) will be contacted 1 month after the screening day to follow up on patient visits and on outpatient blood work for which clients were given requisitions. He will be asked if he noticed any benefits of this program.
2. After 3 months, Dr. Fox will be re-contacted to check for outstanding results.
3. At 4 months, if follow-up blood work has not been performed, clients will be contacted individually by telephone by Seabird Health to be reminded and to find out why they did not follow through with the blood tests.

6) Statistical Analysis

Primary end point: How many clients (all of whom claimed not to have known diabetes) had HbA1c \> 6.5%? This number indicates the prevalence of unknown diabetes in this First Nation community. And how many clients had a fasting glucose \>7% and 2 hour post glucose drink glucose level \>11%? Comparison of these two groups of results will indicate the correlation of the A1c test with the conventional glucose diagnostic tests in this First Nation population.

Secondary end points:

How many clients had an HbA1c \> 6% but \<6.5% and therefore have pre-diabetes. How many clients have hypertension with Blood pressure \> 140/90. How many clients with a history of gestational diabetes and no follow up OGTT had diabetes (HbA1c \>6.5%)

NCT01950676,Feasibility of Using a Smart Phone Application for Self-titration of Insulin on Glycemic Control in Patients With T2DM,Feasibility of Using a Smart Phone Application for Self-titration of Insulin on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"The primary aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a patient-centered smart phone application for insulin self-titration on glycemic control. Over a 18-month period, suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on oral antidiabetic agents, thus requiring insulin treatment patients, will be recruited from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Patients randomized to the intervention group will be instructed to self-adjust their insulin dose using a smart phone application designed to guide self-titration; patients randomized to the control group will receive the usual clinical care. The primary outcome measure is change in glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), 6 months post-enrollment. The investigators hypothesize that using a smart phone application for insulin self-titration is effective in improving glycemic control in T2DM patients compared with usual care.","Background:

Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) require insulin therapy after suboptimal glycemic control with oral antidiabetic agents. Initiating insulin therapy and adjusting dosage is vital in improving clinical outcomes among patients with diabetes. However, timely and appropriate dosage titration is challenging for many patients. Doctors also contend with many patients lacking the confidence to self-titrate insulin. Hence, reinforcing patients' self-empowerment is important in diabetes management. Developing tools that facilitate dosage adjustment of insulin may have substantial benefits to glycemic control.

Objectives:

The overall aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a patient-centered smart phone application for insulin self-titration to improve glycemic control relative to usual care in patients with T2DM. The specific aim of the study is to determine the technical and clinical feasibility of a patient-centered smart phone application for insulin self-titration on glycemic control (HbA1c) of suboptimally controlled patients with T2DM who are starting insulin treatment.

Study Design:

This 24-week study is a randomized controlled trial that will involve participants recruited from Singapore General Hospital, a 1500-bed tertiary care hospital. The target population will consist of insulin naive patients with T2DM (30-70 years old) with suboptimal glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.5%) while on oral antidiabetic agents.

Sample Size:

Eighty patients will be recruited in the study and randomized into either the intervention or control group in equal numbers (n=40) within strata defined by provider (i.e., within each of the five doctors). Patients will be nested within providers, and randomization within each provider will be performed in blocks of 4 subjects: 2 for the intervention and 2 for the control.

Subject Selection:

Eligible patients will be recruited over a 18-month period from the Singapore General Hospital. All patients newly initiated on insulin therapy will receive standard diabetes education from Diabetes Nurse Educators (DNEs). The research coordinator and doctors will work closely with the DNEs to identify eligible patients for this study. When a patient is eligible to participate in the study, the research coordinator will provide a study information brochure and explain the study design to the patient. Investigators will obtain an informed consent from patients prior to randomization.

Intervention:

Use of a smart phone application in self-titration of insulin

Primary Outcome Variable:

Difference in change in glycemic control (HbA1c) between the intervention and the control group

Procedures:

Recruited patients will receive once-daily injections of insulin detemir, a long-acting insulin, to be given at bedtime. The physicians are free to keep patients on all oral antidiabetic agents, except for thiazolidinediones. All recruited patients will receive free glucometers and test strips.

Statistical Analysis:

The primary analysis will be a comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c at 24 weeks post-randomization in the treatment and control groups in the context of a linear mixed-effects model with random effects for patients and doctors. The study is randomized, so baseline features and potential confounders should be approximately balanced between the treatment and control groups. However, the sample size is small (80 patients in total) so the mixed-effects model will be adjusted for covariates selected using forward stepwise variable selection with the AIC criterion. Potential covariates include age, gender, whether the patient themselves has a smart-phone, and treatment satisfaction.

The mixed-effects model allows all non-missing data to be used in the analysis without imputation. However, for the estimate of the difference in reduction in HbA1c to be unbiased, it is required that the distribution of the data missingness conditional on the variables in the model and the observed data does not depend on the values of the missing data, so that the data is missing-at-random.This is a common and a reasonable assumption. However, it is possible that the analysis of attrition will indicate that additional covariates need to be included in the mixed-effects model. With the aim of developing a tailored analysis plan for a definitive study, a few additional models for comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c will also be considered. For example, a linear mixed-effects model with random slope and intercept for each patient and doctor which incorporates the intermediate HbA1c measurements for each patient will also be fit. It is unknown a priori whether such a model will have reduced power because of patients attaining equilibrium titration at different times or if such a model will have increased power because it uses more observations albeit on the same group of patients. Depending on the rate of attrition and whether attrition is related to covariates, a propensity score for missingness may be developed and models fit which are adjusted for or stratified by this score.

The primary examination of efficacy will be through a linear mixed-effects model with random effects for each doctor and patient, under the assumption that the distribution of missingness conditional on the covariates and observed data does not depend on the missing data values. However, the investigators will examine several analyses for appropriateness including simple comparisons of the reductions in HbA1c between the treatment and control groups under last-observation-carried-forward, which is expected to be fairly conservative, and worst-observation-carried-forward, which is expected to be extremely conservative. What these methods lack in rigor may be offset by their simplicity.",COMPLETED,,2013-03,2015-12,2015-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,66,ACTUAL

This study is a randomized controlled trial.,"MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This study is a randomized controlled trial.

Participants:

The population of the study consisted of individuals with type 2 diabetes who presented to hospital diabetes outpatient clinic between July 2018 and January 2019, and the study sample, on the other hand, included a total of 100 individuals with type 2 diabetes who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study. The study was completed with a total of 93 subjects, including 46 in the intervention group (n = 46) and 47 in the control group (n= 47). A Diagnosis and Follow-up Form for Individuals with Diabetes (socio-demographic characteristics, diabetes-related characteristics, metabolic values), which was prepared by the researcher in line with the literature, and the Turkish Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire (T-MDDQ) were used to collect the data.

Preparation and content of the education material:

The education material was based on four different guidelines, namely, educator's guidelines for adults with diabetes; the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up guidelines for diabetes mellitus and its complications; diabetes diagnosis and treatment guidelines; and international education guidelines for diabetes health professionals. The diabetes education videos prepared and presented by the researcher in line with these resources were sent to the participants' smartphones in parts. The educational content consisted of 8 sections: what is diabetes? (basic concepts, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, importance), medical nutrition therapy in diabetes, exercise therapy in diabetes, medical treatment in diabetes, acute complications of diabetes, chronic complications of diabetes, foot problems in diabetes, life with diabetes, and diabetes management under special cases.

Data collection process:

The intervention group: In the first meeting, the individuals in the intervention group were informed about the video-based diabetes education and how they would get the videos, and data collection forms were administered. The blood analysis results (HbA1c, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride) taken on the same day during outpatient clinic follow-ups were recorded. After the administration of the forms, blood pressure, height, and weight measurements were made, and the first interview was completed. Following the first interview, diabetes education videos created previously were sent to the mobile phones of the individuals in two episodes a week fashion. Video submission was completed in a total of four weeks. In the second interview, three months after the video submission had been completed, data collection forms were re-administered to the individuals, and blood analysis results were recorded. The interview was completed after measuring their blood pressure and weight. During the period between the first and second interviews, the individuals continued to receive routine outpatient follow-ups.

The control group: In the first interview, the individuals with diabetes in the control group were given information about the study, and then data collection forms were administered. The blood analysis results (HbA1c, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride) taken on the same day during outpatient clinic follow-ups were recorded. The first interview was completed after blood pressure, height, and weight measurements were made. Later, individuals continued to receive routine outpatient follow-ups without any other procedures. In the second interview held three months later, data collection forms were re-administered, and blood analysis results, blood pressure, and weight measurements were recorded. At the end of the second interview, diabetes education videos were sent to the individuals in the control group, too, and they were provided with the same education.

Data analysis:

The statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) was used to analyze the data. P\<.05 was accepted statistically significant. In descriptive statistics, mean, ± standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values, and percentages were used, and in nonparametric tests, Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact test, McNemar's test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, and Spearman's rho measurements were employed.",COMPLETED,,2018-07-01,2019-07-01,2019-01-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,93,ACTUAL

NCT01890876,"Altitude, Exercise and Glucose Metabolism in Pre-diabetic Men",Altitude-dependent Effects of Concentric and Eccentric Exercise on Glucose Metabolism in Pre-diabetic Men,"Concentric (CE) and eccentric (EE) exercises may differently affect glucose metabolism which may be additionally modified when exercises are performed in hypoxia, e.g. at moderate (1500 - 2500 m) or high (2500 - 3500 m) altitudes. However, data on the effects of glucose metabolism due to CE and EE in hypoxia are scarce but would be of utmost importance considering the increasing number of persons suffering from impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes and the unique opportunities provided by the mountainous regions of the Alps to perform CE (e.g. uphill hiking) and EE (downhill hiking, downhill skiing) at altitude between 1500 - 3500 m. Metabolic responses to exercise may be largely mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is predominantly derived from the contracting limbs and may support the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis during exercise. In addition, IL-6 is elevated with acute and chronic altitude exposure at least partly mediated via adrenergic stimulation. Thus, the type of exercise as well as hypoxia may contribute to IL-6 elevations and differences in serum IL-6 concentrations might help to explain distinctions between responses of glucose metabolism to CE and EE at low and moderate to high altitude.

32 male subjects suffering from pre-diabetes will be randomly assigned to a downhill (EE) or uphill (CE) walking group performing 9 sessions at low altitude (860 - 1360 m) and 9 sessions at moderate to high altitude (2000 - 2500 m). Between normoxic and hypoxic condition will be a break of approximately 12 month. Measurements of glucose metabolism, IL-6 plasma concentration will be performed pre, mid (day 5) and post intervention. Moreover anthropometric, strength and exercise capacity characteristics will be performed pre and post intervention.

We hypothesize that EE in hypoxia is more effective in the modulation of glycemic control in pre-diabetic men than CE in hypoxia as well as EE and CE in normoxia. It is suggested that effects on glucose metabolism are associated with changes in plasma IL-6 concentrations. EE in hypoxia is expected to result in a more persistent rise of plasma IL-6 concentration than CE in hypoxia and in normoxia and to a more pronounced rise in plasma IL-6 than EE in normoxia.",Not desired.,COMPLETED,,2013-06,2015-12,2014-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,32,ACTUAL

NCT01934660,Links Between Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases,Inflammatory Characterization of Known or Possible Cardiovascular Diseases,"Background:

- Cardiometabolic diseases are a combination of medical disorders that, when they occur together, increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Researchers want to learn if there is a relationship between these diseases and inflammation (redness, swelling, and pain). Inflammation affects the entire body. Researchers will study this relationship in people with heart disease and diabetes, and compare it to healthy people.

Objectives:

- To learn if there are links between inflammation and cardiometabolic diseases.

Eligibility:

* Adults 18 years of age or older with heart disease or diabetes.
* Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older.

Design:

* Participants will have up to six study visits. There will be first visit, then an optional visit 12 months after the first visit.
* At the study visits they will have:

  * Blood taken with a needle in their arm.
  * An electrocardiogram. Small patches are stuck to the chest and limbs. A machine measures electrical signals of the heart.
  * Completed a number of questionnaires.
  * A body scan called an FDG PET/CT. A substance will be injected through a tube in their arm. They will lie on a special bed that will move in and out of the PET/CT scanner. The PET/CT scanner will take pictures of the body. The scan will last up to 30 minutes.
  * Some participants will have other body scans ( FDG PET/MRI). The procedures are similar to the FDG PET/CT scan. These other scans will last about 30 minutes total.
  * Some participants will also have a CT scan of their heart. A substance will be injected through a tube in their arm. They will lie on a table in a large, donut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube will move around their body, taking many pictures. This procedure can last up to 2 hours.
  * Some participants will have tests that measures blood pressure and how the blood moves through the body.
  * Some participants will have small samples of skin and fat tissue taken.","Over the past two decades, the number of subjects with cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes have been rising. Characterizing these disease states reveals that inflammation is a common feature of CMD; however, mechanistic links between inflammation and these disease states in humans remain poorly understood. In this protocol, we aim to characterize inflammation within the blood vessels, blood, fat and skin in diabetes and coronary artery disease compared to those without disease. We hypothesize that diabetes and coronary disease will be systemic inflammatory states and will provide an important frame of reference for parameters found on novel imaging techniques in another ongoing protocol trying to understand how skin inflammation affects risk for CMD and CVD (13-H-0065).",COMPLETED,,2013-12-02,,2022-08-03,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,150,ACTUAL

NCT00000160,Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS),,"To determine whether photocoagulation helps prevent severe visual loss from proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

To determine whether a difference exists in the efficacy and safety of argon versus xenon photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","By the 1950s, diabetic retinopathy had become a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States. The use of photocoagulation to treat proliferative retinopathy gained widespread use in ophthalmic practice following its introduction in 1959. However, only a few studies of photocoagulation incorporated any of the basic principles of controlled clinical trials, and these involved inadequate numbers of patients. Consequently, there has been inadequate evidence of the actual value of the procedure. Because of the clinical importance of diabetic retinopathy and the increasing use of photocoagulation in its management, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) was begun in 1971. This randomized, controlled clinical trial involved more than 1,700 patients enrolled at 15 medical centers.

One eye of each patient was randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other to followup without treatment, regardless of the course followed by either eye. The eye chosen for photocoagulation was randomly assigned to either of two treatment techniques, one using an argon laser and the other a xenon arc photocoagulator. Patients were followed at 4-month intervals according to a protocol that provided for measurement of best corrected visual acuity.

Treatment was usually completed in one or two sittings and included scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation extending to or beyond the vortex vein ampulae. The argon treatment technique specified 800 to 1,600, 500-micron scatter burns of 0.1 second duration and direct treatment of new vessels whether on or within one disc diameter of the optic disc (NVD) or outside this area (NVE). Focal treatment was also applied to microaneurysms or other lesions thought to be causing macular edema. Followup treatment was applied as needed at 4-month intervals. The xenon technique was similar, but scatter burns were fewer in number, generally of longer duration, and stronger, and direct treatment was applied only to NVE on the surface of the retina.",COMPLETED,,1972-01,,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,,,TREATMENT,0,
NCT04304560,Value of SGLT2 Inhibitor (Dapagliflozin) as an Added Therapy in Diabetic Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,Value of SGLT2 Inhibitor (Dapagliflozin) as an Added Therapy in Diabetic Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a well-recognized independent risk factor for heart failure (HF). Whereas the prevalence of HF in the general population is 1-4%, it reaches approximately 12% in T2DM patients. In 1972, Rubler reported a specific diabetes-associated cardiac injury called diabetic cardiomyopathy. This cardiomyopathy is defined by ventricular dysfunction occurring without coronary disease or hypertension. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is also characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis.

A large body of work indicates that diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with altered cardiac energy metabolism. Indeed, in obese T2DM patients, heart lipid uptake is increased. Several studies support that free fatty acid (FFA) accumulation leads to the increased production of diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and reactive oxygen species (ROS), affecting cardiac insulin sensitivity and cardiac contractility. On the other hand, hyperglycemia and glucose overload have been involved in cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in the context of T2DM and obesity. The diabetic heart is simultaneously characterized by impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and obvious signs of glucose overload, such as ROS and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) production as well as hexosamine pathway chronic activation. Interestingly, when comparing diabetic and nondiabetic obese patients, we previously demonstrated that hyperglycemia per se plays a central role in the impaired cardiac mitochondrial activity associated with myocardial contractile dysfunction.","Primary Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Dapagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, on cardiovascular Cardiomyopathy, morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Secondary Objective: Change in the fibrosis and oxidative stress markers and its relation with progression of cardiomyopathy.

Proposal Steps

1. Ethical committee approval will be obtained from Ethics committee of Faculty of Medicine, Elmenoufia University.
2. This study will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov after ethical committee approval .
3. All participants should agree to take part in this clinical study and will provide informed consent.
4. 60 participants who are Type 2 Diabetes and HFrEF Patients will be recruited from the Elmenoufia Hospital, Cardiology department, Elmenoufia University,
5. The 60 participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups:

   * Control groups: receives the standard therapy for DM \&HFrEF.
   * The second group: receive 10mg tabs of Dapagliflozin ( Forxiga) ® and standard therapy for HFrEF.
   * Subjects will be treated with medication regimens for at least 3 months
6. All patients will be submitted to:

   * Full patient history and clinical examination.
   * Routine follow up before and after each visit. (complete blood picture, liver function tests, renal function tests).
   * Echocardiography before the start and after completion of the study which include:
   * Conventional echocardiography.
   * All Study participants underwent standard echocardiography with Doppler studies, using a GE vivid 9 machine all subjects were examined in the left lateral Decubitus position according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography (24).
   * 1) Assessment of LV dimensions:
   * M-mode measurements were obtained from left parasternal with special Attention was given not to include overlying trabeculations in the ventricular septum or posterior wall measurements, which may overestimate thickness.
   * Measurements were taken at the end diastole -defined as the beginning of the QRS complex -but preferably using the widest LV cavity diameter, and at the end systole -using the narrowest LV cavity diameter.
   * The diastolic measurements obtained were the interventricular septal wall thickness, the LV internal diameter at end diastole and posterior wall thickness. In systole, the LV systolic diameter was measured.
   * 2-Systolic function assessment:
   * The measurement of LV ejection fraction (%) and LV fractional shortening (%) were performed to evaluate the systolic function using M mode tracing. Ejection fraction (EF %) was calculated as percentage change of LV chamber volumes between diastole and systole from apical four and two chamber views using modified biplane Simpson's rule. (25)
   * NB: Ejection fraction ≥ 55 % indicated a normal systolic function and \<55 % is considered systolic dysfunction.
   * 3-Diastolic Function assessment:
   * Pulsed - wave Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate diastolic LV function; Doppler studies were recorded from the apical 4- chamber view, with a sample volume positioned with in the inflow portion of the LV, midway between the annular margins of mitral valve. Mitral velocity profiles were digitized from velocity of the Doppler tracings.
   * Waves measured by pulsed conventional Doppler:
   * The peak E (early rapid ventricular filling) wave velocity: It is an early filling wave occurs in the early diastole as the pressure in the left ventricle falls below that in the left atrium (N = 50 - 85 cm / sec).
   * The Peak A (late ventricular filling) wave velocity: It is a late filling wave occurs as the left atrial contraction causes acceleration of the flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle (N = 35 - 5 0 cm/sec). (26)
   * E / A ratio: The ratio between the early filling and the late filling wave (N = 1 - 2).
   * N.B Diastolic dysfunction is considered if DT \> 220 ms and E / A ratio \< 1.
   * Tissue Doppler Imaging:
   * By using GE Vivid 9 echocardiography machine programmed with tissue Doppler options, tissue Doppler imaging was performed in the apical views (4- chamber, and long axis), continuous wave Doppler tissue imagining was obtained by positioning a sample volume at the basal septal and lateral mitral annuli. Myocardial velocity was detected throughout each cardiac cycle and the average value was recorde
   * Three major velocities were recorded at the annular sites:
   * The peak major positive systolic velocity when the annulus moved towards the apex (Sm) (N = 9.1 ± 1.2 cm/sec).
   * Two peaks of major negative velocities when the annulus moved back towards the base during early (Em) (N = 14.7 ± 314 cm/sec) and late (Am) phase of diastole (N = 11.0 s ± 2.3 cm/sec).
   * E/Em ratio was also calculated.
   * Isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) is measured from the end of the systolic velocity to the beginning of the early diastolic velocity (N = 59 ± 22 cm/sec).

Systolic dysfunction if peak systolic velocity \< 8 cm / sec.

* Diastolic dysfunction is considered if IVRT \> 90 ms or E/A\<1 or E/Em\>10.
* Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging analysis:
* Parasternal basal and apical short-axis views, as well as three standard apical views, were acquired. All grey scale images were obtained at a frame rate of 77 ± 6 frame/s (range: 63-99 frames/s) using second harmonic imaging. While acquiring images, the LV basal short-axis view was identified by the presence of mitral leaflets, while excluding the mitral annulus and the apical view was identified by the presence of a LV cavity in the absence of papillary muscles. We made every effort to obtain the LV cross-section as circular as possible. For each view, three consecutive cardiac cycles were acquired during a breath hold and digitally stored on a magneto-optical disc for offline analysis. Measurement of strain and rotational parameters was performed offline using dedicated software (Echo-Pac PC, version 10.0; GE Medical systems)
* A region of interest was manually adjusted to include the entire myocardial thickness; care was taken to avoid including the pericardium in the region of interest. The software then selected stable speckles within the myocardium and tracked these speckles frame-by-frame throughout the cardiac cycle. Counterclockwise rotation was marked as a positive value and clockwise rotation as a negative value when viewed from the LV apex. LV twist was defined as the net difference (in degrees) of apical and basal rotations at isochronal time points and was auto computed by the software from the values of the basal and apical rotation. LV torsion was then calculated as the ratio between LV twist (in degrees) and the LV diastolic longitudinal length (in cm) between the LV apex and the mitral plane.
* A pulse wave Doppler tracing obtained from the LV outflow tract was used to identify the timing of aortic valve opening and closure.",UNKNOWN,,2020-03,2021-04,2021-03,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,60,ESTIMATED

* That there is a difference in change in visual acuity resulting from treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab compared with dexamethasone implant in eyes with advanced macular oedema
* That there is a difference in degree of resolution of macular oedema resulting from treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab compared with dexamethasone implant in eyes with advanced macular oedema
* That both intravitreal bevacizumab and dexamethasone implants have a manageable and acceptable safety profile in eyes with diabetic macular oedema","Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of vision and the most common cause of blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries. Swelling of the central retina, or ""macular oedema"", is the commonest cause of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy.

Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is treated with laser photocoagulation of areas of leak in the macula according to established guidelines which take into account the extent of the leak and its proximity to the centre of the macula, the ""fovea"". This treatment does not always work, however, and is inherently destructive.

New drugs have become available which appear to reduce the risk of loss of vision in eyes with advanced diabetic macular oedema for which further laser treatment is unlikely to be beneficial. Intravitreal injection of slow-release steroid formulations such as Ozurdex™, a slow release formulation of dexamethasone, has been proposed as a new modality to treat clinically significant DMO. We have recently conducted randomised clinical trials which have demonstrated that treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) leads to reduction of DMO and improved vision in these eyes. Another class of drugs, inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) such as bevacizumab (Avastin®), also appear efficacious.

While both drugs appear to reduce macular oedema and improve vision in the short term, they may have differences which could guide how they are best used. Around 1/3 of eyes that receive dexamethasone may develop elevated intraocular pressure and cataract, both of which are manageable but may complicate the picture. Anti-VEGF drugs do not have these local adverse events, however they must be given more frequently (4-6 weekly vs 4-6 monthly for Ozurdex™) and it is suspected they may have a neurotoxic effect on the retina. Some authorities suspect that anti-VEGF treatment may be associated with a small increased risk of having a stroke or heart attack during treatment, even when they are injected into the eye. This has not been proven with a related drug, ranibizumab, but it is still possible that it may occur with bevacizumab.

This will be a, 2 year, phase II, prospective, multicentre, randomised, single-masked clinical trial of sustained release intravitreal dexamethasone (Ozurdex™) versus intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin®) for diabetic foveal oedema that persists or recurs despite previous laser treatment, or for which the investigator believes laser treatment is unlikely to be helpful.",COMPLETED,,2010-10,2014-09,2014-09,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,61,ACTUAL

The bolus basal insulin regimen is a widely accepted therapy concept to treat hyperglycaemia in patients with T1D. This concept requires a very good knowledge of the individuals prandial and basal insulin requirements. However, insulin requirement depends on insulin absorption from the injection site and the individual's insulin sensitivity which relies on a number of effects including body composition, inflammatory processes and environmental factors. Climatic factors such as differences in air temperature could affect both, insulin absorption and insulin sensitivity as suggested by recent reports. For instance, it is reported that hot baths can accelerate the absorption of short acting but not of long acting insulin formulations from the subcutaneous depot. In addition, local warming of the injection site by a novel device (InsuPatch) results as well in an accelerated insulin action profile of short acting insulins. Moreover, Berglund et al. reported seasonal variations in insulin sensitivity in elderly men with increased insulin sensitivity during summer time.

Although an effect of temperature on insulin absorption and action can be assumed and was subject to current clinical trials, there is only little knowledge on the effect of humidity and the cumulative effect of humidity and temperature on insulin pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. For subjects with type 2 diabetes it was reported that accommodation to high temperatures and moist air of more than 75% is impaired compared to healthy subjects as determined by skin blood flow, temperature and moisture.

NCT00596427,Mechanisms of Glucose Lowering Effect of Colesevelam HCl,"Effects of Colesevelam HCl on Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity, Gluconeogenesis, Glucose Absorption and Lipid Synthesis in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","The mechanism by which colesevelam HCl lowers glucose is not known. Knowledge of the potential mechanism of action is important for defining the role of the drug among oral antidiabetic agents available for use in subjects with diabetes. The objective of this study is to provide insight into the mechanisms of action of colesevelam HCl in T2DM. The mechanisms of interest include hepatic insulin sensitivity, rate of appearance of exogenous glucose and changes in incretin hormone concentrations.","Colesevelam HCl (marketed in the U.S. as WelChol®) is a non-absorbed polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption, and is indicated to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme cholesterol 7-(alpha)-hydroxylase is upregulated, increasing the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. These compensatory effects increase the clearance of LDL-C from the blood, decreasing serum LDL C levels (1; 2).

Recently, it has been shown that colesevelam HCl also improves glycemic control in subjects with T2DM who are not controlled adequately on metformin, sulfonylurea or a combination of the two drugs (3). The mechanism of action for glucose lowering is not known. Improved glycemic control with colesevelam HCl treatment could be due to any of several mechanisms. Colesevelam HCl could reduce hepatic insulin resistance and lead to a decrease in hepatic glucose production (HGP). The observation by Schwartz et al (4) of significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose concentrations in colesevelam-treated T2DM patients suggests such a reduction in HGP, as fasting hyperglycemia is a direct function of HGP. Colesevelam HCl could also decrease post-prandial glucose absorption. Changes in glucose absorption with other bile acid sequestrants (BAS) (5) and bile acids (6) have been reported.

With regard to molecular mediators of the colesevelam effect on glucose metabolism, there is considerable evidence emerging about the role of bile acids and nuclear transcription factors, such as the farnesyl X receptor (FXR), in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism (7) (8) (9-15). Changes in cellular lipids or nuclear hormone receptors might directly alter HGP although mechanisms leading to changes in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism by colesevelam HCl have not previously been investigated.

Significant changes in cholesterol and bile acid synthesis rates are expected with colesevelam treatment. BAS treatment can alter the transhepatic flux and compositional profile of the circulating bile acid pool (16), and thus its hydrophobicity, and this may effect the activation of nuclear receptors, including FXR (17; 18). Determination of the effect of colesevelam treatment on bile acid synthesis may provide evidence for its metabolic effects. The effects on hepatic fatty acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis or DNL) have not been investigated and may provide further evidence for a metabolic effect of colesevelam.

Specific hypotheses about its mode of action will be tested, focusing on hepatic glucose metabolism and intestinal glucose absorption.",COMPLETED,,2007-11,2009-04,2009-04,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,60,ACTUAL

The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of an AI-based bedtime smart snack intervention in reducing nocturnal low glucose in people living with T1D on MDI therapy compared with traditional CGM-augmented MDI therapy as the control.","Participants will be randomized to either first use CGM only to manage glucose for four weeks (control arm) followed by four weeks of DailyDose App + bedtime smart snack intervention (intervention arm), or vice-versa. There will be a one-week washout period between arms.

During the control arm, participants will wear CGM and will manage their glucose as usual. Participants will be asked to wear a smart watch overnight to collect sleep metrics, weigh themselves weekly in the morning before eating, and answer a one-item sleep quality scale survey weekly. We will collect CGM measurements during the control arm for evaluation of effect of intervention and assessment of the accuracy of low glucose prediction.

During the intervention arm, participants will use the DailyDose Smart Snack smart phone app. When they are getting ready for bed, an AI-based model in DailyDose will predict the likelihood of overnight low glucose at bedtime and will recommend a personalized snack to help avoid nocturnal hypoglycemia. The nutritional content of the snack (carbohydrate, protein, fat, etc.) will be dependent on the predicted overnight minimum glucose and the predicted time of the minimum overnight glucose level.

NCT04028076,Improving Diabetes Medication Adherence for African Americans in Madison and Milwaukee Through Peer Support,Peers LEAD: Partnering With Peers in the Community to Improve Diabetes Medication Adherence for African Americans in Madison and Milwaukee: A Pre-Post Single Group Intervention,"The burden of diabetes is higher among African Americans (AAs) in Wisconsin as hospitalization rates for diabetes complications such as stroke and amputations are four times higher than whites and has worsened by 334% since 2011. The most important self-management behavior for improving diabetes outcomes is medication adherence, i.e., taking medicines as recommended by providers. Poor adherence to diabetes medications is common among AAs and contributes to disproportionally worse outcomes. While the reasons for nonadherence are multifactorial, health beliefs, lack of self-efficacy, social support, and limited health literacy, are critical factors for AAs. Due to discrimination experiences and provider distrust, AAs may have health beliefs that do not align with biomedicine. Existing adherence interventions designed for general populations may be ineffective for AAs because they do not adequately address these fundamental factors.

The intervention is peer-led, such that AAs who have diabetes and are adherent to their medicines (Peer Ambassadors- (PAs)) are paired with AAs who have diabetes and are nonadherent (Peer Buddies- PBs)).Throughout the 8-week program, PAs actively support and teach PBs about self-advocacy in patient-provider relationships, as well as sharing their experiences managing diabetes, providing social support, enhancing health literacy, patient activation (engagement and empowerment) and self-efficacy. PAs help deliver the intervention via initial face-to-face and phone/app follow-ups with PBs, in addition to structured group education delivered to PBs by a physician, pharmacist, and diabetes educator separately. The investigator's aim is to use a community-engaged design to pilot the intervention, assessing the feasibility of gathering pre/post outcomes including culturally-informed diabetes-health beliefs, self-efficacy, patient activation, medication adherence (using surveys), and A1c, and further refine the intervention via feedback from an advisory board comprised of the PAs.

The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be feasible for AAs with diabetes. This study uses a collaborative approach involving patient stakeholders throughout the research process by directly engaging AAs with diabetes to utilize their experience, knowledge and advice. This project advances the development of culturally-appropriate medication adherence interventions for AAs with diabetes.","In the United States, diabetes affects 3.7 million African Americans (AAs) who are more likely to be diagnosed compared to non-Hispanic whites and are at a greater risk for diabetes-related death and disability. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in Wisconsin, incurring an estimated $3.9 billion annually in health care and lost productivity costs. Each year, more than 1,300 people in Wisconsin die from diabetes and many more suffer diabetes-related complications such as heart disease and amputations. This burden is higher among African Americans (AAs) whose hospitalization rates for diabetes-related complications are four times higher than whites. The most important self-management behavior for improving diabetes outcomes is medication adherence, i.e., taking medications according to provider recommendations. Poor medication adherence places a significant economic burden on US healthcare systems, resulting in $290 billion in costs. A nonadherent patient requires three extra medical visits per year, leading to $2000 increased treatment costs annually. In diabetes, the estimated US cost savings due to improving poor adherence is $1.16 billion. Nonadherence is thus a critical societal problem with negative economic consequences and detrimental effects on health and well-being.

Poor adherence to diabetes medicines is common among AAs and contributes to disproportionally worse diabetes outcomes for AAs. AAs have a 25% lower adherence to diabetes medications than non-Hispanic whites. While the reasons for nonadherence are multifactorial, health beliefs, lack of social support, and limited health literacy, are critical factors for AAs. Due to limited access to high quality healthcare, discrimination experiences, and distrust in providers, AAs may have health beliefs that do not align with biomedicine. Existing adherence interventions designed for general populations may be ineffective for AAs because they do not adequately address these fundamental psychosocial factors. The proposed work builds on the investigator's studies of AAs' diabetes experiences and medication adherence. The investigator's previous research showed that AAs felt a loss of autonomy because of diabetes and believed that diabetes was caused by exposure to certain medications. Navigating the healthcare system seemed difficult. Some AAs did not take their medicines because they did not know how to ask their provider questions. AAs wanted peers to support/teach self-advocacy and positive empowerment in patient-provider relationships. Hence, the investigators worked with community/patient stakeholders to develop a prototype 8-week peer-led culturally appropriate intervention to address identified psychosocial/ sociocultural issues and enhance diabetes medication adherence for AAs, called Peers Supporting Health Literacy, Self-Efficacy, Advocacy and Adherence (Peers LEAD).

Typically, peer support occurs through group, nurse and community health worker visits; however, these require expensive professional staff. Peers LEAD offers an innovative, culturally appropriate and more informal, low-cost means of providing peer support with similar benefits. The long-term goal is to decrease diabetes-related morbidity among AAs through culturally appropriate interventions to increase medication adherence. The study objective is to pilot Peers LEAD using a community-based participatory design to examine for feasibility, outcomes including culturally-informed diabetes-health beliefs, diabetes and medication self-efficacy, patient activation (a measure of engagement/empowerment), medication adherence, and blood glucose, and refine Peers LEAD via participant feedback. The central hypothesis is that Peers LEAD will be feasible and effective for AAs with diabetes, leading to improved outcomes in self-efficacy, activation, adherence, and blood glucose. The study aims are:

Aim 1: To pilot PEERS LEAD to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention intended to shift negative diabetes-health beliefs to positive, enhance diabetes self-efficacy, and improve adherence, and blood glucose levels. In conjunction with an interdisciplinary team of a physician, pharmacist and diabetes educator who will provide structured education, Peer Ambassador Board (PAB) members will help deliver Peers LEAD, via initial face-to-face and phone/messaging app follow-ups, serving as peer ambassadors (PAs). Peer buddies (PBs) (AAs 30-65 years old with type 2 diabetes and poor medication adherence) will participate in the program, with a target of 10 20 PBs each in Madison and 10 PBs in Milwaukee. PBs will complete surveys and glucose tests assessing changes in outcomes. Interviews and focus groups will be conducted with all PBs and PAs respectively to get feedback on the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that PA/PB feedback will lead to a feasible intervention showing improvement in adherence and glucose levels for the PBs.

Aim 2: To refine PEERS LEAD for AAs with diabetes using feedback from Peer Ambassador Boards and Peer Buddies. The investigators will: (1) establish two PABs, (2) train PAB members as PAs, (3) elicit feedback to refine Peers LEAD.

This study uses a collaborative approach involving patient stakeholders throughout the research process by directly engaging AAs with diabetes to utilize their experience, knowledge and advice. This is the first study to enhance peer support for AAs with diabetes using phone/messaging app technology. This project advances the development of innovative interventions for AAs with diabetes and focuses on social and behavioral constructs identified from the investigator's prior work to influence medication adherence.

Overall Study Design: This pilot research will be conducted in 2 phases using an intervention mixed methods design in which the investigators will test the 8-week Peers Supporting Health Literacy, Self-Efficacy, Advocacy and Adherence (Peers LEAD) intervention in Phase 1, and then examine specific intervention elements for refinement in Phase 2. The rationale for this design is that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods are sufficient in explaining the outcomes of the intervention. Mixing both methods gives a more complete analysis of Peers LEAD. Qualitative results collected during and after the intervention will allow the investigators to further explain the outcomes, examine participant's experiences and modify the methods in a follow-up and/or dissemination study.",COMPLETED,,2019-07-10,2020-10-05,2020-10-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,20,ACTUAL
NCT02531776,Patient Experiences With Injection Needles,Patient Experiences With Injection Needles,"This study will focus on how different injection needles are perceived by patients. The needles differ in design and mechanical properties, and will be tested in people with Type 2 Diabetes. The measured parameters during and after needle insertion are: penetration force through skin (measured with force gauge), pain perception (rated on visual analog scale, VAS, on a scale from 0 to 10), and skin blood perfusion at insertion site (measured with laser speckle contrast scanner). Furthermore, any skin reactions will be recorded.","It is estimated that there presently are about 370 million diabetics in the world, and the number is increasing, particularly in newly industrialized countries, such as China and India. Approximately 90% of diabetics have Type 2 diabetes, often caused by lifestyle, such as obesity and lack of exercise. 3-5% of diabetics have Type 1 diabetes, and the cause of the disease is unknown. The remaining 5-7% have either pregnancy diabetes (temporary illness), MODY (""Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young"") or rarer forms of diabetes.

For the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, insulin has to be injected into the subcutaneous tissue from which it is taken up into the circulation. People with Type 1 Diabetes do not produce insulin and must thus inject insulin to stabilize blood sugar levels, typically via one or two daily injections with basal insulin, as well as so-called ""bolus"" injections at the time of each meal. This adds up to approximately 4-5 daily insulin injections. Type 2 diabetics, who are still ""early"" in the disease, have reduced sensitivity to the insulin they produce, so the pancreas overproduces insulin. Beyond lifestyle changes, treatment with metformin in tablet form will in this case be the first-line drug. In the later stages of the disease, the insulin production decreases and insulin therapy should be initiated, optionally in combination with a GLP-1 analogue (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1). It is estimated that only half of all people with Type 2 diabetes are diagnosed, and that half of those diagnosed are not in treatment. Worldwide, about 27% of the treated type 2 diabetic patients receive insulin treatment, or a GLP-1 analog, 1-2 times a day.

From the above figures it can be estimated that over 100 million diabetes injections are performed globally every day. In addition, other disorders also require subcutaneous administration of drugs, e.g. growth hormone therapy or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or intestinal diseases. Thus, it is of great importance that the needles used for injections, are as painless and comfortable to use as possible.

The larger needle manufacturers have for many years sought to make needles less painful and to cause less skin trauma. Until recently, these measures have primarily been making needles thinner and shorter, but now needles with alternative grindings and needle tip designs are marketed. This is to compensate for the decreased robustness of the new very thin needles, which increase the risk of the patients damaging the needle tip during an injection. Little is known, however, of how these design changes influence the perception of pain, skin damage, etc.

Despite the large market for subcutaneous needles, the methods to test newly developed needles have remained the same for many years. One of the methods frequently used is a mechanical test where the needle is passed through a rubber strip, and the penetration force is measured. This method is rapid, reproducible and with very little variation, but there are no published data comparing the force measured in the rubber strip, with that measured in humans, and how or if the penetration force in a rubber strip relates to pain, discomfort, or other physiological parameters. Smith compares the insertion forces measured in the rubber strip and in a piece of cut off porcine tissue with the conclusion that these two behave very differently and that the rubber strip is estimated to be primarily useful in testing the needle lubrication and other friction-reducing parameters.

The second method often used is a subjective patient assessment, where the test subject uses a 'Visual Analogue Scale' (VAS) to indicate how much pain he or she experiences in connection with the needle insertion. Pain indicated by VAS is a known and accepted method, but is simultaneously a measurement method with great variety, because a person's pain sensitivity depends on many things such as stress levels, emotional state, as well as expectations for the experience.

This project is innovative in that it introduces a new method for quantitatively measuring small tissue damages in the skin, as for example, a needle insertion.

The study combines technological and medical research in the form of mechanical design of medical devices and biological evaluation of mechanical impact, which in our opinion is highly relevant and quite innovative. Results from this study will be used to develop new and improved needles, which are predicted to increase patient satisfaction and make everyday life with injections easier and more convenient for the many millions of people with diabetes who every day take insulin and / or GLP-1 injections .

The method is based on the Laser Speckle technology, and measures the tissue damage in terms of the increased skin blood perfusion in connection with a needle insertion. Prior to this project, the project group performed a number of tests on pigs and the method has proven to be sensitive enough to detect differences in the blood perfusion that occurs as a result of differences in tissue damage caused by insertion of needles that vary less than 0.1 mm in diameter, Williams et al used a photoelectric pletysmografi (PPG) to investigate changes in skin blood perfusion in human subjects following injections with insulin and diluted insulin, as well as with a needle insertion to investigate the effect of the needle trauma alone. A rapid increase in blood flow was seen for all interventions. Insulin injections resulted in increased signal for more than 60 minutes after the injection, whereas the diluted liquid and the needle insertion created an increased signal for about 10 minutes. By using laser Doppler technology, Rayman et al studied how the skin circulation changed after needle insertion in people with and without diabetes. The study revealed that the people with diabetes had lower maximum-perfusion after needle insertion than the healthy subjects. Both of the above mentioned clinical studies indicate that the method obtained from the project group's pig studies could be transferred to a human study.

Thus, the study will include 35 test subjects who will receive needle insertions with 18 differently designed needles. Penetration force through the skin, pain perception and skin blood perfusion will be recorded for all needles, and any skin reactions will be recorded. By the end of the study, the following questions can be answered:

1. Which needle design parameters influence pain and skin blood perfusion, and are these two effects related?
2. Does skin blood perfusion after needle insertions in humans compare with those measured in pigs?
3. Does penetration force relate to pain and skin blood perfusion, which needle design parameters influence the force in skin, and how does it relate to the penetration force in a rubber strip?",COMPLETED,,2014-12,2015-08,2015-07,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,30,ACTUAL
NCT02863276,Modulating the Stress Response in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Patients Undergoing Colon Surgery,Modulating the Stress Response in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Patients Undergoing Colon Surgery,"Background Surgical injury provokes a stress response. These pathways mediated by stress hormones and cytokines cause a catabolic state. The loss of body cell mass may result in prolonged convalescence and increased morbidity. Protein catabolism after colorectal surgery is even more increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Epidural blockade, by reducing the intensity of the catabolic response, improves substrate utilization after surgery in non-diabetic patients. This effect is even more pronounced in diabetic patients receiving amino acids.

The aim of the study is to explore the effect of two different protocols to manage blood glucose control on glucose and protein metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing colon surgery and receiving epidural analgesia and perioperative feeding with amino acids. The following hypotheses are tested:

1. Tight perioperative blood glucose control with intensified insulin therapy compared to standard blood glucose control in presence of general anesthesia with epidural analgesia and amino acid infusion would reduce endogenous glucose production and leucine oxidation.
2. Tight blood glucose control and perioperative infusion of amino acids induce a more positive protein balance compared to standard blood glucose control by better oxidative glucose utilization and redirecting amino acids from oxidative to synthetic pathways.

Material and Methods A total of 20 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 undergoing elective colorectal surgery will be admitted to the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive standard blood glucose control (blood glucose target \<10 mmol\*l-1; control group; cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) group, n=8) or to receive tight blood glucose control with intensified insulin therapy (blood glucose target\<6 mmol\*l-1; intensified insulin group; II group, n=8). All patients will receive general anesthesia and an epidural catheter for perioperative analgesia. During surgery (intraoperative state) and immediately after surgery (postoperative state) when receiving an amino acid infusion protein and glucose kinetics will be assessed using a stable isotope technique with L-\[1-13C\]leucine and \[6,6-2H2\]glucose and circulating concentrations of glucose, glucagon, insulin and cortisol will be measured.

In this study, cefazolin is delivered directly to the target tissues using subcutaneous injection of antibiotic solution and then dispersed using high-frequency external ultrasound. Using this system, a much higher concentration of antibiotic can be achieved than through traditional treatment methods.

Unlike traditional delivery methods, Direct Antibiotic Delivery does not rely on blood supply and is beneficial for subjects with Diabetes or subjects who have received radiation therapy and blood supply is limited.","In this study, the DOSAGE of cefazolin that is delivered is a fraction of that which is already FDA approved for intramuscular (IM) administration.

Exclusion criteria will be as follows: strict vegan, regular user of fish oil or other food supplements, extreme sports, inflammatory bowel disease, colon irritable, celiac disease, continuous antibiotics or less than three months of the latest antibiotics use, type 2 diabetes and hormonal, liver or kidney disease. Duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks.

Intervention groups will be as follows (n=50/group):

Group 1: Dietary proteins from animal sources 70% and from plant sources 30%, representing an average Finnish diet consumed at the moment.

Group 2: Dietary proteins from animal sources 50% and from plant sources 50%, containing at most 500 g red meat/week (according to the current Finnish Nutrition Recommendations).

Group 3: Dietary proteins from animal sources 30% and from plant sources 70%.

The intake of total protein will be kept at similar level compared to habitual, but intakes of fat and carbohydrates may vary as composing a diet with plant-based protein sources inevitably causes changes for example in dietary fibre intake. We will aim at controlling other potential dietary confounders to the extent that is possible in a whole-diet approach. This will ensure the feasibility of the diets and facilitate future applications in dietary practices at the population level.

The study staff will go over this with you each time.

Visit 1-Screening: (about 3 hours)

• Please fast before this visit

In order to find out if you qualify to take part in the study, you will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:

* Your health history will be taken
* Your height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured
* You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* You will give fasting blood samples of about 3-5 tablespoons and urine samples
* If you are female and can have children, you will be given a urine pregnancy test
* You will take a glucose tolerance test (GTT) A dietitian will briefly discuss your diet and exercise. An ECG will be done to measure your heart function. ECG measures the electrical activity of your heart. You will be asked to lie down and small sticky pads will be placed on your arms, legs, and across your chest.

The GTT test involves collecting 1 blood sample before, and 4 samples up to 2 hours after, you drink a measured amount of glucose (a sugar) in a pleasant tasting liquid. You will have 2 tablespoons of blood drawn. An indwelling intravenous (IV) needle will be inserted into your vein for the 2-hour period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.

Depending on the results of your blood and urine tests, you may be asked to come in for a second visit in about 1 week. The screening blood tests may provide you with information on your health that could be important to you, for example diagnosing diabetes.

VISIT 2: (about 1 hour)

• You do not have to fast for this visit and may take your morning medications as usual

You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:

- You will meet with a dietician for an assessment of your eating habits. The dietitian will advise you on how to maintain a stable diet during the study.

* If your blood tests indicate that you have diabetes, you will receive instructions on diet and exercise to improve your blood sugar levels.
* If your HbA1c level is high, you will be given a home glucose monitoring device (glucometer) with instructions on its use for daily testing. HbA1c is a measure of average glucose levels over the prior few weeks.
* You will be given a 2-week supply of study drug and asked to stop any over- the-counter vitamins that you are taking until you have completed this study. We will provide 3 bottles of study medicine at a time. Each bottle will be uniquely identified for use in the morning, midday or evening. You will be asked to take 2 tablets from the morning bottle, then 2 from the midday bottle and 2 from the evening bottle. You will also be given a daily multivitamin to take. This will be a total of 7 tablets a day for 10 weeks.

All unused study drug should be returned when you come in for the next visit in 2 weeks. It is important that you are able to take all the study drug. If we find that you are unable to take most of the study drug, you will be removed from the study.

VISIT 3: (about 6-8 hours)

•

* Please be fasting and do not have alcohol or exercise for 48 hours prior to the visit. You may be asked to withhold some of your usual medicines on this day but bring the doses to the visit with you to be taken at a later time. You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:
* Brachial artery ultrasound: This is a way to see how the walls of your arteries respond to change in blood flow. For this test, you will lie on a bed and we will take sound wave pictures of the artery in your elbow area. After the initial pictures, we will then inflate a blood pressure cuff on your upper arm for 5 minutes. As soon as the cuff is deflated more pictures of the same artery are taken. We will give then give you a pill called nitroglycerine to dissolve under your tongue. When the pill dissolves in a few minutes, final pictures of the same artery will be taken.
* The brachial test will be repeated 2 hours after a high fat meal is eaten. We will give the meal to you It will contain known amounts of fat,carbohydrates, and protein.
* Augmentation index: This is a test to see how stiff the walls of your artery may be. A small microphone will record the signal from the artery in your wrist for about 5 minutes.
* Several samples of blood (2 tablespoons) will be taken before you eat the high fat meal and when the second brachial test is completed. An indwelling IV needle may be inserted into your vein during this period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.
* DEXA scan. DEXA is a 4-5 minute x-ray body scan that provides accurate body fat mass measurements.If you are a woman who can have children, you will have a urine pregnancy test. If you are pregnant you will NOT be able to have the DEXA scan.
* A dietician will assist you with food questionnaire about your usual diet.
* A 4-week supply of study drug will be given to you with instructions on how to take it. Please bring any remaining study drug bottles with you to your next visit.

Visit 4: telephone call. You will also be asked about your ability and willingness to continue to take the study medicine until the end of the study.

We will also ask if you are having any new symptoms that may indicate low blood sugar such as hunger, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, difficulty speaking, feeling anxious or weak.

You should notify the study team at any time by telephone to report these symptoms. You may be asked to come in for an extra visit if these are occurring.

At baseline visit (month 0). Participants who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to human coach-based diabetes prevention program or digital diabetes prevention program. An equal number of participants will be randomly assigned to both groups (like flipping a coin).

If participants are randomly assigned to receive the human coach-based diabetes prevention program, the participants will be referred to a local Diabetes Prevention Program close to the participants' area. The Diabetes Prevention Program consists of 16 weekly sessions during months 1 to 6 and 6 sessions during months 7 to 12. These group sessions may be delivered in-person at the local program or remotely using video conferencing. During these sessions, participants will receive information about lifestyle change behaviors focusing on weight loss, physical activity, and nutrition from a trained lifestyle coach.

If participants are randomly assigned to receive the digital Diabetes Prevention Program, the participants will receive the Sweetch Digital Health Kit (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) in the mail within approximately 8-12 days of the participants' first study visit. The Sweetch digital health kit consists of a smartphone app and a digital body weight scale that is connected via Bluetooth to the app. The phone app also consists of brief Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lessons on type 2 diabetes prevention, which participants will be encouraged to complete.

Although previous diabetes efforts have reduced overall disease burden, they have failed to eliminate racial and geographic disparities. The story of John Henry, the ""steel-drivin' man"" represents strength and self-determination among Black Men. But often these traits lead men to ""manup"" about their health and prevents them from taking care of their diabetes. This study examines how we can assist Black men in improving their diabetes. Based on the traits of John Henry, we will conduct a culturally-tailored study to 1) determine if our education program including coping strategies and motivation text messages lowers A1c; and, 2) how program operates in a rural setting while learning how we can best improve it for a larger study. We hope to have the information to conduct a larger study with Black men in rural areas to improve their diabetes outcomes.","As the United States' 7th leading cause of death, improving diabetic outcomes is a public health priority. Black American men disproportionately suffer from diabetes more than White counterparts. John Henryism endorses traditional masculine norms for Black Men, such as self-determination and strength, as assets. However, these norms can also act as barriers to diabetes self-management as they restrict access to support from family and friends at a time when it is most needed.

The purpose of this application is to pilot a targeted, culturally-tailored, diabetes self-management intervention for 50 rural Black men to improve diabetes-related outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a 6-month diabetes self-management intervention, grounded in John Henryism, with two arms consisting of the active intervention group and a delayed intervention group to test the intervention's effect on the primary outcome of A1c change. Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of conducting a 6-month culturally-tailored diabetes self-management intervention for Black men in a rural NC community.

The intervention includes a 10-week education program focusing on self-management, social support and coping strategies; and, daily motivational text messages. Aim 1 analysis includes repeated measures t-test (or the non-parametric equivalent Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test) to compare the mean scores of the both groups pre and post intervention. Aim 2 analysis focuses on key parameters required for conducting a future trial. This innovative study leverages the self-reliance and active coping mechanisms of John Henryism by fostering self-determination to properly self-manage diabetes while providing stress management and coping skills to buffer John Henryism's adverse effects.",COMPLETED,,2022-02-12,2023-10-31,2023-10-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,OTHER,50,ACTUAL

A Proof of Concept Pilot Study",The impacts from diabetes are both patient related and healthcare based. Offloading is recognised as the priority treatment for healing neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic plantar foot ulcers. The new PulseFlow DF boot is a device which claims to off load but has little or no evidence on diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) subjects. Thus the primary aim of this study is to observe forefoot plantar pressures in a cross sectional purposively selected sample compared to usual standard of care.,"The impacts from diabetes are both patient related and healthcare based. DFU is associated with a high mortality rate at 34% at 1 year. There is an associated higher limb amputation rate from DFU than other causes. The high mortality rate, high amputation rate and increased socio-economic burden means providing high quality evidence based DFU service provision should be a NHS priority. Offloading is recognised as the priority treatment for healing neuropathic and neuro-ischaemic plantar foot ulcers. Since the provision of non removable devices or total contact casts (TCC) is poor, options have to be available that are equivalent in effectiveness at off loading and healing DFU. By improving the quality of offloading choices and acceptability for devices this will improve healing rates and reduce the cost burden where currently in the UK diabetic foot care in 2015 accounted for 0.6%/585.5million pounds of the NHS budget. The evidence for effectiveness of non removable devices is poor. Therefore any device that offloads to the equivalent or more than previous devices and current usual standard of care must be evidenced.

Aim 1: Determine muscle activity and balance control during a sit-to-stand in adults age above 50 with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Aim 2: Assess local balance recovery and latency responses to lateral surface perturbation during quiet standing.","Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common condition affecting patients with diabetes. The prevalence of DPN increases with age and the duration of having diabetes. Approximately 30% of patients with diabetes have peripheral neuropathy globally, and 4.5 million Americans have DPN.

DPN typically affects more distal peripheral nerve branches, resulting in sensory loss. DPN causes axonal damage and leads to a loss of muscle strength. These degenerative effects significantly contribute to fall risks and feelings of instability.

Falls most commonly occur during transitional tasks such as the sit-to-stand (STS) and stand-to-sit (StandTS). The overall objective of this study to assess the effects of DPN on balance control and muscle activity during transitional tasks (STS and StandTS) and during lateral perturbation while standing.

NCT04226027,Dynamically Tailored Behavioral Interventions in Diabetes,Dynamically Tailoring Interventions for Problem-Solving in Diabetes Self-Management Using Self-Monitoring Data - a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT),"In this project, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of a novel approach to personalizing behavioral interventions for self-management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to individuals' behavioral and glycemic profiles discovered using computational learning and self-monitoring data. This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial with n=280 participants recruited from the participating Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group and the usual care (control) group with 1-1 allocation ratio. Half of the participants (n=140) will be randomly assigned to a usual care (control) group. Both groups will receive standard diabetes education at their respective FQHC site. In addition, the experimental group will receive instructions to use T2.coach for a minimum of 6 months.","One of the main difficulties in managing diabetes is that each affected individual requires personally tailored combination of diet, exercise, and medication to effectively control their blood sugar. Rather than strictly following a doctor's prescription, individuals need to carefully examine their lifestyle choices and their impact on their health. Independent learning, experimentation and problem solving become of great importance. However, they can be challenging for individuals with diabetes. In this project, the investigators will refine and evaluate a novel intervention for diabetes self-management that uses computational analysis of self-monitoring data to help individuals with type 2 diabetes identify what daily activities, including consumption of meals, physical activity, and sleep, have impact on blood glucose levels, and suggest modifications to these daily activities to improve blood glucose levels.

Growing evidence highlights significant differences in glycemic function and cultural, social, and economical circumstances of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that impact their self-management. Precision medicine strives to personalize medical treatment to an individual's genetic makeup, computationally discovered clinical phenotypes and lifestyle. Studies showed the benefits of tailoring not only medical treatment, but also behavioral interventions. Yet, currently, personalization of self-management in T2DM requires each individual to engage in discovery, reflection, and problem-solving-critical but cognitively demanding activities-or to rely on their healthcare providers. Both of these may present considerable barriers to individuals from medically under-served low income communities. Mobile health (mHealth) solutions in T2DM bring promise of reaching wider populations in need of self-management; however, few such solutions provide assistance with personalizing self-management behaviors. Ongoing efforts on personalizing behavioral interventions outside of T2DM focus on tailoring behavior modification techniques to individuals' psycho-social characteristics, such as self-efficacy ), and tailoring delivery of intervention to individuals' context rather than on personalizing self-management strategies.

The ongoing focus of this research is on developing informatics interventions for diabetes self-management, with a specific focus on discovery with self-monitoring data and on problem-solving for improving glycemic control. In the proposed research the investigators introduce T2.coach, an mHealth intervention that uses computational analysis of self-monitoring data to identify behavioral patterns associated with poor glycemic control and formulate personalized behavioral goals for changing problematic behaviors. This study will evaluate T2.coach's efficacy in a two-arm RCT with stratified randomization conducted with Clinical Directors Network (CDN), a well-recognized primary care practice-based research network (PBRN) of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-designated Center of Excellence (P30) for Practice-based Research and Learning.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2020-01-17,2025-09-30,2025-09-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,280,ESTIMATED

It evaluates the use of the Artificial Pancreas (closed loop system) in very young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 1-7 years. This outcome study aims to determine whether 24/7 automated closed loop glucose control improves time in range compared to sensor augmented pump therapy. An extension phase will evaluate the effect of long-term home use of the 24/7 automated hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system on glucose control (UK sites only).

The study employs an open-label, multi-centre, multi-national, randomized, two-period, crossover design. Participants undergo a 2-4 week run-in period, followed by two 16-week treatment periods (one for each therapy) separated by a 1-4 week washout. The order of treatments is randomized. Up to 80 young children (with a target of 72 randomized subjects) on insulin pump therapy will be recruited from paediatric outpatient diabetes clinics.

Before using the study devices, participants and their parents/guardians receive training on the safe use of the study pump, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, and hybrid closed loop system. Nursery or school carers may also be trained if needed. During the closed loop arm, subjects use the system for 16 weeks under free-living conditions at home and in nursery/school without remote monitoring. In the control arm, subjects use sensor augmented pump therapy for 16 weeks under similar conditions, with regular contact and 24/7 telephone support from the study team.

The primary endpoint is the time spent in the target glucose range (3.9-10.0 mmol/l) as recorded by CGM. Secondary outcomes include the time spent with glucose levels above and below target and other CGM metrics. Safety assessments include the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In the extension phase, participants have follow-up contacts every 3 months, with the primary endpoint measured over 18 months from the end of the primary phase and compared to sensor augmented pump therapy during that phase. Secondary outcomes, safety, and utility will be assessed similarly.","Purpose of clinical trial:

Although mounting evidence suggests that alterations in lipid metabolism in persons with abdominal obesity are associated with a several medical complications, including diabetes, little is known about the factors responsible for this effect. The project in this application is designed to examine how the addition of endurance exercise training to a weight-loss program alters whole-body fatty acid availability, uptake, and oxidation as well as the expression of cellular factors that regulate these processes. In addition, we will evaluate whether these alterations are associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity. In the end, these experiments will provide insight into the cellular and whole-body adaptations in fatty acid metabolism in response to weight-loss and exercise training that may lead to enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Identifying relationships between gene expression, whole-body fatty acid metabolism and clinical outcome measurements, such as insulin sensitivity, may lead to improvements in the therapeutic and/or the preventative approach to obesity and its co-morbidities.","Despite robust findings emphasizing the importance of weight-loss and exercise for the prevention and management of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms responsible for the improvements in metabolic health are not completely understood. Mounting evidence suggests that abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism in persons with abdominal obesity are associated with insulin resistance. Alterations in fatty acid mobilization and oxidation may be primary adaptations responsible for the improvements in metabolic health after weight-loss and endurance exercise training. We hypothesize that a disparity between muscle fatty acid uptake and oxidation is regulated by the expression of genes and proteins that participate in intracellular transport, trafficking, and metabolism of fatty acids. We believe that alterations in the expression of these factors in response to weight-loss and endurance exercise training will underlie changes in the non-oxidative disposal of fatty acids, and thereby improve insulin sensitivity. We will determine the effects of weight-loss and exercise training on whole-body fatty acid mobilization and oxidation and the expression of factors that regulate these processes in skeletal muscle. In addition, we will evaluate how these alterations are associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity.

Participants will:

Take YG1699 or a placebo every day for 8 days. Visit the clinic 7 times for checkups and tests. Keep a diary of their symptoms. Estimate PK data from a single dose of YG1699. Estimate PD data at baseline and the last day.","Background

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), as one of the most common and serious complications of diabetes, has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. A domestic epidemiological survey shows that the prevalence of DKD in community patients was 30%-50% from 2009 to 2012, and accounted for about 40% in hospitalized patients in China. At present, the treatment of DKD is the comprehensive management of blood glucose, blood pressure and blood lipid. Nevertheless, about one-third of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and nearly half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will progress to ESRD. Patients with DKD have higher complication rates and mortality. Studies have shown that the mortality rate of patients with diabetes complicated with DKD is 3 to 12 times higher than that of patients with simple diabetes. Although blood glucose is actively controlled and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are used to control hypertension in the treatment of diabetes, the progression of DKD is still inevitable. Much more clinical needs are still present. Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) are new hypoglycemic drugs discovered in recent years. They play their hypoglycemic roles by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in renal tubules and increasing urinary glucose excretion. More clinical studies have found that SGLT2s not only the hypoglycemic effect, but also has the effect of delaying the progression of DKD and improving the prognosis of heart failure, and is recommended by international authoritative guidelines with class IA evidence for cardiorenal organ protection.

Glucose cannot freely pass through the cell membrane and must rely on glucose transporter proteins on the cell membrane. Sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) are an important family of transporter proteins that regulate glucose absorption and excretion. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are the most well studied members of this family and are both major glucose transporter proteins. SGLT1 is expressed in various tissues such as the small intestine, heart and kidney. SGLT2 is mainly expressed in segment S1 of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney.

In the renal tubules, 95% of glucose is reabsorbed through SGLT2, and 5% of glucose is reabsorbed through SGLT1. When SGLT2 is inhibited, the glucose reabsorbed through SGLT1 significantly increases to 50%, so the hypoglycemic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors may be weakened. The dual effects of SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitors can bring more potential benefits for treatment, including continuing to maintain the effectiveness of SGLT2 selective inhibitors; inducing intestinal cells to secrete endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and YY peptide (PYY); reducing the adverse reactions of SGLT2 inhibition, such as genitourinary tract infections and constipation; blocking or delaying the absorption of glucose by the gastrointestinal tract.

Sotagliflozin is a SGLT2i with partial SGLT1 inhibitory activity. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2019 for adjuvant treatment of T1DM complicated with obesity. Recently, the sotagliflozin heart failure protection study was terminated in the middle stage due to the excellent effect of improving the outcome of heart failure. And it has a good effect of reducing proteinuria in patients with DKD. This suggests that SGLT1/2 dual-channel blockers may have better hypoglycemic and organ protection effects.

YG1699 is an oral SGLT1 and SGLT2 dual-channel blocker, belonging to c-aryl glucoside derivatives. It can reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood in the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting SGLT-1, and at the same time inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney by inhibiting SGLT-2, thereby increasing the excretion of glucose from the kidney and effectively reducing blood glucose levels. YG1699 reduces the risk of DKA caused by SGLT2i by increasing SGLT1 inhibitory activity. In addition, YG1699 shows non-pH-dependent solubility, has sufficient solubility in the gastrointestinal tract, has a high oral bioavailability in preclinical models, and has a low possibility of drug interactions. At present, including YG1699, there are three SGLT1/2 dual inhibitor are in the clinical research stage.

YG1699 has completed three clinical trials, named the phase I study (YG1699-01) on healthy subjects in the United States and the phase II study (YG1699-201) on type 1 diabetes, as well as the bridging study (YG1699-102) on healthy subjects in China. These clinical studies have confirmed that YG1699 has good human PK characteristics and good safety and tolerance. In the phase II T1DM study, compared head-to-head with DAPA, it shows a better effect on reducing postprandial blood glucose. All these clinical trials are in patients with eGFR\&gt;30 ml/min/1.73M2.

However, about 12 million diabetic patients have renal insufficiency, and there is still no pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of YG1699 in patients with renal insufficiency.

The main hypothesis of the study is that bread enriched with beta-glucan will have a positive effect on blood glucose control (HbA1c) in persons with intermediate hyperglycemia.

Bread (intervention and control) will be produced by Nofima (Ås, Norway) using food-grade beta-glucan from oat and barley and shipped to the study centers (Bergen (N), Gothenburg (S), Paderborn, and Leipzig (D)) and there distributed for free to the participants of the study. The study will last for 16 weeks with measurements at baseline, after 8 weeks and after 16 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be taken, anthropometry and body composition measured, and questionnaires on health status and socio-economic status, physical activity, nicotine use, alcohol habits, chronotype, quality of life, and consumer acceptance of the study bread will be filled in.","Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in most European countries with intakes ranging from 40-60% of total energy. Consequently, the role of its quality and quantity for the development of metabolic diseases is the focus of substantial debate. Notwithstanding, replacing processed carbohydrates with unprocessed carbohydrates is regarded as a major strategy to improve public health. This is to a substantial degree based on strong observational evidence that higher intakes of dietary fiber (cereal grains containing the same relative proportions of bran, germ, and endosperm as the intact caryopsis) are associated with lower risks of total mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence and cancer mortality. Nonetheless, data from medium- to long-term intervention studies among adults are less conclusive regarding the benefits of whole-grain consumption on glycemic control, bodyweight and serum lipids. In fact, benefits may be largely confined to whole grains stemming from oats or barley, calling for explicit consideration of these whole grains and/or its mechanistically relevant component.

Adding complexity, many commonly consumed whole grains or products rich in dietary fiber are characterized by a high glycemic index (GI\>70), in fact, a high dietary fiber content will not predict a low glycemic response. The GI describes the glycemic potency of the available carbohydrates in a food, is measured under defined conditions and is used to calculate the glycemic load (GL: GI x amount of available carbohydrates). Preferred consumption of high GI grain products is of concern since a higher dietary GI and GL may be causally linked to a substantial increase in T2DM risk and may translate into a considerable health burden.

In European societies, T2DM prevalence is increasing as a result of higher overweight and obesity rates and increases in longevity. Efforts are hence needed to develop carbohydrate-based food items that are both rich in fiber and whole grain and have a low GI and tailored to the dietary habits of middle-aged adults with insulin resistance (also called 'pre-diabetes' or intermediate hyperglycemia defined by intermediately increased HbA1c levels). This stage precedes clinical T2DM and affects up to 30% of adults in Western societies.

Enrichment with selected fibers, e.g. beta-glucan from oat and barley, may offer an alternative to whole grain kernel breads, which may not meet consumer preferences and is also endorsed by EFSA health claims. Preliminary small-scale studies indicate acute, short- and longer-term benefits of such bread for glycemic and/or insulinemic responses among persons with T2DM or at risk of T2DM. However, these studies suffer, besides the small sample sizes, from high amounts of test food (8 servings per day = 320 g bread) and use of white bread as a comparator. The present study will test whether habitual consumption of a bread containing oat bran concentrate and meeting the high beta-glucan content of the EFSA claim (4.3 g beta-glucan per 30 g available carbohydrate) compared to normal wheat bread high in whole grain but without kernels will affect glycemic control over a period of 16 weeks.

Main hypothesis The main hypothesis of the study is that bread enriched with beta-glucan will have a positive effect on blood glucose control (HbA1c) in persons with intermediate hyperglycemia.

Objectives Main objective: Establish whether replacement of habitual bread intake with a low GI bread containing beta-glucan improves glycemic control among persons at risk for T2DM.

Secondary objectives: Examine the effects of the intervention on capillary blood glucose, body composition and serum lipid levels, and address consumer acceptance of the intervention bread.

Study procedures This is a multicenter study testing the effect of bread containing beta-glucan on glycemic control in participants with intermediate hyperglycemia.

It develops as a result of increased maternal body's resistance to insulin - a major hormone that allows for utilisation of glucose (sugar taken in with food) within cells. It was found out that GDM occurs more frequently in overweight women but also in women with a history of certain conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Usually, GDM disappears after pregnancy is completed but it is associated with some serious hazards for women and her unborn child, if untreated properly. Diet is a first-choice treatment but sometimes insulin therapy must be initiated if keeping a diet alone is not enough to maintain blood sugar within recommended values. Insulin therapy is effective but it requires several injections during each day and insulin is a strong acting hypoglycemic agent that may induce rapid falls in blood sugar, also dangerous for mother and unborn child.

In the investigators study, the investigators would like to investigate if metformin that is a commonly used hypoglycemic drug can be effectively used for GDM treatment.

In particular, they have higher rates of diabetes-related complications and other related conditions such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, neuropathy, and the risk of amputation. Diabetes affects 34 million adults in the US. Achieving a target HbA1c less than 8% can be challenging through diabetes management. Patients are able to monitor their blood glucose levels with devices such as blood glucose meters or continuous glucose monitors to facilitate diabetes management and glycemic control. Past studies have demonstrated that these devices are effective in engaging patients in the improvement of diabetes management. Current advancements in remote patient monitoring and self-monitoring have been observed to be effective in facilitating improvement in diabetes outcomes. However, the effectiveness and financial feasibility of these devices delivered in conjunction with automated patient engagement systems in remote patient monitoring programs is not well understood among underinsured, underserved, and vulnerable minority populations as they face a high-cost barrier particularly with continuous glucose monitors.

It is considered important to examine the relationship between changes in plantar pressure distribution and postural balance, physiological expenditure index and gait parameters in diabetic individuals. Within the scope of this project, based on the above mentioned reasons, we plan to produce a personalised off loading insoles designed for diabetic foot.","Excessive localized loading on the plantar surface leads to repeated microtrauma and the development of diabetic foot ulcers. The plantar region, subjected to constant weight-bearing pressure, develops chronic wounds due to dangerous vascularity. Excessive plantar pressure is considered the primary risk factor for plantar ulcers in diabetic individuals; custom insoles are considered the gold standard in treatment for off-loading plantar pressure.

The off-loading technique, which reduces plantar pressure, is an effective ulcer prevention strategy for neuropathic feet with impaired sensation and increased plantar load and tissue stress.

A review of the literature shows that previous studies have clearly demonstrated that off-loading insoles are effective in reducing abnormal plantar pressure in a specific area and that they also have some effect on the pressure distribution in surrounding areas. However, the potential impact of this positive effect on postural balance, postural control, and individuals' physiological expenditure and energy consumption has not been sufficiently studied.

NCT03374176,Efficacy of Amoxicillin-metronidazole Compared to Clindamycin in Patients With Periodontitis and Diabetes,Efficacy of Amoxicillin-metronidazole Compared to Clindamycin in the Treatment of Periodontitis in Patients With Diabetes,"Periodontitis is an inﬂammation of the supporting structures of the teeth, usually caused by speciﬁc or groups of microorganisms that results in the progressive destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. the objective of periodontitis treatment is to reduce the number of periodontal pathogens. However, there is not an agreement in the use of systemic antibiotics in patients with diabetes. The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of amoxicillin/metronidazole compared to clindamycin during non-surgical treatment of periodontitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Patients and methods In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, a total of 42 patients with chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes were included in a 24-months follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either amoxicillin/metronidazole or clindamycin every for 7 days. Clinical determinations (depth of probing, bleeding at the probe and plaque index) were performed to determine the extent and severity of periodontitis before and after the pharmacological treatment. The intra-group differences were calculated with Wilcoxon rank test. The inter-group differences were calculated with Mann-Whitney test. Sex, bacterial plaque, and bleed to the sounding were summarized using proportions and analyzed with the chi-square method. In all analyses, a P-value of \<0.05 (two tailed) was considered statistically significant","A parallel, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, single center clinical trial was designed to compare the efficacy of two antibiotic therapies with 24-month follow-up. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Universitary Center of Health Sciences of University of Guadalajara and conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before the initiation of study procedures.

A total of 5 non-study subjects with chronic periodontitis were recruited and used for the calibration exercise. Two designated examiners measured full-mouth probing pockets depths (PPD) for all 5 subjects. On the same day (with a minimum of 15 min separation), the examiner repeated the examination. Upon completion of all measurements, the intra-examiner repeatability for PPD measurement was assessed. The examiner was judged to be reproducible after fulﬁlling the pre-determined success criteria (the percentage of agreement within 2 mm between repeated measurements had to be at least 70 %). The examiner showed 78.3 % reproducibility.

The sample size was calculated with a 95% confidence level and statistical power of 80 %. A standard deviation of 1.0 mm with an expected difference of 1.0 mm probing pocket depth reduction between treatments. This resulted in a total of 14 patients per arm, however this sample was increased 20% (21 patients per group) to compensate for possible dropouts.

Patient population Criteria for selection Patients of both sexes (aged \>18 to 70 years) with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis according to the 1999 International World Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions and a history of type 2 diabetes with a HbA1C \< 8 % and a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) \< 180 mg/dL. Patients with aggressive periodontitis, pregnant or lactating females, required antibiotic pre-medication for the performance of periodontal examination and treatment or received antibiotic treatment in the previous 3 months were excluded. A history of anti-inﬂammatory therapy within preceding six months or that had received a course of periodontal treatment within the last 6 months, allergies to penicillin, metronidazole or clindamycin, and were not able to provide consent to participate in the study were also criteria for exclusion.

Intervention Subjects were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive 500 mg amoxicillin + 250 mg metronidazole or 300 mg clindamycin + placebo using a computer that generated a list of random numbers. Subjects were instructed to take the treatment three times a day for 7 days in both groups.

Assessments During these sessions, a case presentation was given to each subject related to the speciﬁc features of his/her disease, as well as a supra- and sub-gingival mechanical debridement was performed. A complete periodontal examination was performed, including a full medical and dental history, an intra-oral examination and a full-mouth periodontal probing. A radiographic examination was undertaken using either periapical x-rays or a ortopantomography.

Clinical parameters Clinical parameters were assessed using a North Caroline Periodontal Probe by the calibrated examiner at six sites. Full-mouth plaque scores were recorded by assigning a binary score to each surface (1 for plaque present, 0 for absent) and by calculating the percentage of total tooth surfaces that revealed the presence of plaque detected by the use of tablet. Similarly, a full-mouth percentage bleeding score was calculated after assessing dichotomously the presence of bleeding on probing from the bottom of the pocket when probing with a manual probe with a force of 0.3n. Full-mouth PPD and recession of the gingival margin were recorded at the same time with measurements rounded to the nearest millimeter.

Non-surgical periodontal therapy Periodontal therapy was initiated within 1 month of the baseline screening examination. A standard cycle of periodontal therapy consisting of oral hygiene instructions, supra- and sub-gingival mechanical instrumentation of the root surface (scaling and root planning) was performed by two experienced therapists.

Local anesthesia was used as necessary. Patients relied on standard oral hygiene methods as instructed at the commencement of the study.

Post-treatment controls The objectives of the post-treatment appointments were to control and reinforce the oral hygiene habits of each subject, to monitor the early healing events and to report any adverse events or additional medications taken. In addition, the 1-week post-treatment visit served as a compliance control, as subjects were asked to return any medication not taken and/or the empty bottles. The number of pills not taken by the study subjects was documented.

Re-assessment examinations Reassessment visits occurred within a month and a half of the completion of the pharmacological treatment. During these appointments, the examiner recorded any changes in the medical history and repeated clinical periodontal parameters recorded at the basal visit.

Statistical analysis Age, FPG, HbA1C, tooth, and sounding depth were presented in means and standard deviation. The intra-group differences were calculated with Wilcoxon rank test. The inter-group differences were calculated with Mann-Whitney test. Sex, bacterial plaque, and bleed to the sounding were summarized using proportions and analyzed with the chi-square method.

The incidence in France is more than 10/105 per year, with a steady increase (\~4%/year), especially in children. Infants born to parents with T1D have a 15-fold higher risk to develop T1D compared to the general population. The appearance of autoantibodies precedes and is highly predictive of the later occurrence of T1D. The activation of B lymphocytes, which produce autoantibodies, is controlled by T helper lymphocytes. Hence, biomarkers associated with initial T lymphocyte activation are likely to precede the appearance of autoantibodies.

The aim of the TRAKR study is to determine whether the appearance of autoreactive T lymphocytes is predictive of the emergence of autoantibodies.

The secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate whether metagenomic, metabolic, or environmental factors are associated with the appearance of autoantibodies; 2) to evaluate the incidence and the time of autoantibody appearance in a French population of genetically at-risk children; 3) to compare the incidence of autoantibodies between infants born to T1D fathers and mothers.",COMPLETED,,2015-05-28,2019-05-17,2019-05-17,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,SCREENING,512,ACTUAL

Blinded continuous glucose monitoring was performed at baseline and following 6 weeks of Vildagliptin therapy.,"This was a prospective study involving adult patients with T2DM attending diabetes clinics in 2 state hospitals in Malaysia. Patients with HbA1c of 7-10% who were treated with stable dose of twice daily premixed human insulin (30% regular insulin, 70% Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) for at least 3 months, with or without metformin as combination therapy, were recruited. Consented participants attended a single education session with a diabetes nurse educator focusing mainly on self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), hypoglycemia recognition and management, and the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), before undergoing a 7 days blinded CGM (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA) to collect baseline GV data. The participants were instructed to perform SMBG 4 times daily for CGM calibration and record any symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes in the SMBG diary. Baseline demographic, insulin dosage as well as HbA1c and renal function were collected. The results of the CGM were blinded to the study participants and investigators till the end of the study.

Participants were then started on Vildagliptin (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) for 6 weeks duration. The dose of Vildagliptin was determined based on calculated eGFR using MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) IDMS (isotope dilution mass spectrometry) traceable formula. Vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily was prescribed for patients with eGFR ≥ 50 ml/min while patients with eGFR \< 50 ml/min received Vildagliptin 50 mg daily as per prescription information recommendation. Drug accountability were assessed by tablet count. Throughout the study period, insulin doses were kept stable but may be adjusted by the investigators in the event of recurrent or severe hypoglycemia. The participants were also given the diabetes team's contact number for adjustment of insulin should they experience more frequent hypoglycemia with initiation of Vildagliptin, as per usual clinical practice.

A repeat 7 day CGM was performed after 6 weeks of Vildagliptin therapy. Changes in weight, insulin dosage and any symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes occurring during the study period were recorded. Data collected from the CGM device were analyzed with EasyGV software to derive the glycemic variability parameters. Primary outcome measures for GV were changes in mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and standard deviation of the mean glucose levels (SD). The investigators also examined other secondary GV measures including M value, mean absolute glucose (MAG), continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA), low blood glucose index (LBGI), high blood glucose index (HBGI) and lability index (LI). In addition, quality of glycemic control with addition of DPP4-I treatment by assessing the % time in range (TIR) with blood glucose in target range of 3.9-10.0 mmol/L, % time above range (TAR), % time below range (TBR) and % of time spent in clinically significant level 2 hypoglycemia (blood glucose \< 3.0 mmol/L regardless of symptoms) were explored. Area under the curve (AUC) above and below blood glucose target of 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L respectively as well as glycemic estimate, i.e. estimated HbA1c (eA1c) from CGM data were also assessed before and after Vildagliptin treatment.",COMPLETED,,2018-09-15,2019-08-31,2019-08-31,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,12,ACTUAL

NCT06241976,Diabetes Risk in London and Its Association with Vitamin D by Ethnic Group (DELVE),Postprandial Glycaemic Response in Different Ethnic Groups in London and Its Association with Vitamin D Status,"The goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between vitamin D status and a diabetes risk factor, postprandial glycaemic response in White, South Asian and Black African Caribbean populations in London.

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Are there differences in postprandial glycaemic response to a sugar water drink or orange juice between White, South Asian and Black African Caribbean people in London?
* Is there a relationship plasma 25(OH)D and the postprandial glycaemic response to a sugar water drink or orange juice consumption?
* What are the knowledge and perceptions of vitamin D intake between White, South Asian and Black African Caribbean people in London?
* Is there a difference in dietary vitamin D intake between the three ethnic groups?

Participants will make two visits to the lab, approximately 2.5 hours each. The order of the two drinks will be randomized via Excel Random function. For each visit, the blood sugar levels will be measured at fasting (0) and every 30 minutes up to 2 hours postprandially (5 times total) using a finger prick. At baseline only (visit 1), participants will fill out a knowledge and perception survey, provide a 4-day estimated food diary, provide a 7 ml blood sample via phlebotomy, and have their height, weight and body fat percentage measured.","Background

Health patterns differ significantly between ethnic minority groups and the white population. In the United Kingdom (UK), the risk of developing diabetes is two-to-six times higher in South Asians (SAs) and up to three times higher in Black African-Caribbeans (ACs) than in white Caucasians and people in these groups develop the condition at a younger age. Parts of London are among the areas of the UK with the highest proportion of minority groups and highest prevalence of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Although multiple factors have been identified including socio-economic standing, diet, culture and attitude, language barriers, genetic, epi-genetic and lifestyles, research into biological diversity is much under-investigated. Recent research found that the postprandial glucose peak in SAs is two-three times larger than that in white Caucasians after identical carbohydrate loads. Our unpublished data also showed the postprandial glucose peak was significantly higher in non-white (Chinese, Indian and Black) than white participants (6.11 nmol/L vs 5.15 nmol/L, P=0.015) after white bread consumption. Though obesity is believed to account for 80-85% of the risk of developing T2DM due to obesity causing insulin resistance, and some minority groups e.g. the Black African and Caribbean population have a higher overweight and obesity prevalence than white Caucasians (73.6% vs. 63.3%), other biological mechanisms have been sparsely investigated, among which is vitamin D (vitD). VitD deficiency in minority groups in the UK is well known and is described as an unrecognized epidemic. In the UK, 50% of SAs and 33% of black ACs demonstrate vitD deficiency vs. 17.5% in white Caucasians, primarily due to more subcutaneous pigmentation that absorbs Ultraviolet B from the sunlight and reduces vitD production in the skin and high latitudes in the UK. This situation is worse in East London in particular because 47% of AC people and 42% of SA people had vitD deficiency compared with 17% of white population in Tower Hamlets. An inverse association of serum 25(OH)D levels with insulin resistance was observed in healthy adults and diabetic patients. Recent evidence shows vitD supplementation may help improve glycaemic control and insulin resistance in T2DM patients. However, little evidence is available for minority groups or residents in London, indicating London (particularly East London) AC and SA communities being underrepresented in the evidence base surrounding diabetes and vitamin D. VitD plays important roles in calcium metabolism and involves in modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation due to its receptors expressed ubiquitously in nearly all human cells including the pancreatic β-cells. Animal studies show vitD treatment improved insulin production and sensitivity, and the increased insulin secretion may be caused by a higher intracellular calcium. Moreover, 1, 25(OH)2D (the active form of vitD) may modulate β-cell growth and differentiation. The secondary high parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration and increased inflammatory markers associated with vitD deficiency may also cause glucose intolerance. VitD may have indirect impact on glycaemic control via obesity. Our research and many others have shown a significant inverse association of body mass index (BMI) and serum 25(OH)D. This is thought to be due to a complex of mutual influence because vitD receptors are expressed on adipose cells and regulate their functions, indicating vitD deficiency might be one of the causes of obesity, thus indirectly leading to increased risk of T2DM.

Postprandial glycaemic response (PGR) has implications in T2DM development. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is widely used to assess the insulin sensitivity, the pancreatic β-cell function, and judge an individual's metabolic capacity to handle carbohydrate foods. However, a recently published study indicated that within- subject variations of the PGR pattern may exist between OGTT and food intake, suggesting a necessity of combining OGTT and a meal/drink tolerance test for individualized glycemic management. The awareness of vitD and its impact on health is poor in the UK. Though the COVID-19 pandemic has brought vitD to the public attention, a recent UK survey reveals that 49% adults are unaware of UK Government guidelines for vitamin D. There is no such survey available on the minority groups, nor in residents of London. The investigators are interested in the dietary vitamin D intake between different ethnic groups in London, which will be partly explanatory to vitD status in the target population and there is an urgent call for research on minority population to address health inequality.

Aims

To investigate the difference in postprandial glycemic response to oral glucose tolerance tests and orange juice consumption between white Caucasian, South Asian and Black African and Caribbean adults

To investigate the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with postprandial glycemic response to oral glucose tolerance tests and orange juice consumption between white Caucasian, South Asian and Black African and Caribbean adults

To assess the knowledge and perception of vitamin D, and dietary vitamin D intake in white Caucasian, South Asian and Black African and Caribbean adults

Study design

This is an acute, randomized, repeated measures cross-over design study. 126 healthy adults living in London will be recruited from white Caucasian, South Asian and Black African and Caribbean populations (n=42 in each group).

Recruitment

Participants will be recruited in two ways:

* From staff and students who live in London with gatekeeper permissions Recruitment adverts will be circulated to staff and students at City, University of London.
* From local communities in London with gatekeeper permissions. More communities will be identified in London to help us with recruitment by circulating the project advert, e.g., East London Community College, East London Community Band, and various community centers in London. In addition, the advert leaflets will be posted at the local supermarkets, libraries, hairdressers and barbers, food outlets etc. with permission of gatekeepers.

Treatments

Participants will consume a glucose drink (75g glucose in 300 ml water, 281 kcal) used for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and pure orange juice (OJ, 100% Pure Squeezed Orange Juice Smooth 300 ml containing 129 kcal, 30 g sugar, 0.3 g fibre, 1.8 g protein and 90 mg vitamin C) on separate occasions with at least 48-hour interval and in a random order. Participants are instructed to consumed each drink consumption within a 5 minute period (time taken is recorded). During the two hour study period, participants remain sedentary and cannot eat and drink anything additional.

Sample and data collection

On the night prior to each of their study visit, participants are asked to follow their normal dietary pattern, have a good night's sleep and avoid alcohol and intensive exercise. Participants are instructed to fast for at least eight hours prior to their visit start time.

Blood glucose concentration is measured at baseline (0 minutes), +30 minutes, +60 minutes, +90 minutes and 120 min by finger prick blood sampling and measured using the HemoCue glucose analyser (HemoCue Ltd, Angelholm, Sweden). For the first visit only, a 7-ml fasting blood is collected at baseline (0 minutes) via phlebotomy to measure serum 25(OH)D, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Body mass index (BMI) and fat composition will be measured using a stadiometer and bioelectric impendence analyzing scale (Tanita, Amsterdam). Participants will complete a vitamin D knowledge questionnaire (at baseline) that includes demographics questions including ethnicity. Dietary vitamin D intake is assessed through an estimated food diary that participants complete over four consecutive days (between visits 1 and 2).

Randomization

The order of the drink consumption is randomized by using Excel Random function. Details are below. In Excel spreadsheet, a list of participants (from 1-126) is shown in one column. On the next column, the RANDBETWEEN function is used, and choosing 0 and 1 as the range to randomly generate the value of 0 or 1. Participants with a value of 0 will consume glucose drink while participants with a value of 1 will consume pure orange juice as their first drink respectively.

Statistical analysis

This study aims to achieve a minimum of 25% variability in postprandial glycaemic response among three ethnic groups considering the response has taken from five different time points with 30 min interval for each person and to achieve an 90% power of the study, 42 people are required in each group (n=126 in total) at 5% level of significance. Continuous data will be presented as mean±standard deviation. Categorical data will be presented as percentage. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA is used to assess the treatment (two drinks) effect (within-subject), the effect-time interaction, and between-subject effects (ethnicity, gender, BMI categories) on blood glucose concentrations (five time-points). Continuous variables (e.g., 25(OH)D etc.) between groups are analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Dietary vitD intake between groups will be analyzed by one-way ANOVA (three groups) or independent t-test (two groups) should data are normally distributed otherwise Mann-Whitney test will be used. Categorical variables e.g. the percentage of vitD deficiency are compared by Chi-Square between groups. Data normality will be tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for longitudinal data will also be used for modelling glycaemic response over time because this model accounts for the correlation between observations within each individual and adjusts confounding factors (e.g. BMI, age). The statistical significance will be reported with a p-value and a 95% confidence interval at a 5% significance level. The statistical software International Business Machines (IBM) SPSS 29 will be used to analyze data. Regression imputation will be used to deal with missing data. Both Intention-to-treat analysis and per protocol analysis will be used for the data analysis.",COMPLETED,,2023-07-01,2025-02-28,2025-02-28,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,OTHER,111,ACTUAL

By providing blood glucose (BG) concentration measurements continuously over consecutive days, CGMs are an increasingly adopted technology. While CGM devices have been shown to improve the safety and effectiveness of diabetes therapy to reduce hypoglycemia incidents and durability and to decrease glycemic variability CGM software and tools available for users to feel motivated and engaged are limited. Users of CGM often use an app that provides an interface for them to track their BG. In most cases, this app is offered by their CGM device provider.

These interfaces are considerably basic and scientific in nature, often developed by scientists and engineers for the everyday user. These apps are particularly dull and tiresome for children and adolescents living with diabetes. Current real-time CGM interfaces present real-time BG reading, in addition to the BG trend and a historical chart, together with minimal options for the user to enter lifestyle data such as medications, meals, and exercise. Examples of such default interfaces are ones offered by Dexcom, Medtronic Guardian and Freestyle Libre. While some of these apps provide patterns and health summaries to the user, these are provided in a separate app to the one streaming real-time BG. With the emergence of rtAPI (real-time Application Programming Interface) integrations with CGMs, there is ample opportunity to improve the dynamism, sophistication, and offerings within these CGM Apps , creating a platform that delights the user rather than one that makes diabetes management seem like a daily chore. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that creating additional engagement in the form of games and real-life rewards will improve glycemic control.",COMPLETED,,2021-01-02,2022-08-31,2022-07-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,92,ACTUAL

These observations will provide the preliminary data for proposing future therapeutic as well as further mechanistic studies of the role of bile acids in the control of glycemia in T2DM.","Background: Intra-jejunal administration of bile acids improves insulin sensitivity.

Hypothesis: The bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in delayed (ileocolonic)-release formulation, stimulates bile acid membrane receptor (TGR-5) and farnesol X (FXR) receptors in the ileum and colon, increasing the secretion of Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), GLP-1, oxyntomodulin (OXM), and Peptide (PYY3-36), improving insulin sensitivity and inducing weight loss.

Aim: To study the effect of an ileocolonic formulation of UDCA on insulin sensitivity, postprandial plasma glycemia and incretin levels, gastric emptying and body weight in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects on monotherapy with metformin.

Study design: This is a single center, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single dose randomized controlled trial to study the effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release UDCA 600 mg twice daily on insulin sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by scintigraphy)and weight loss in overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects. Participants will be receiving monotherapy with metformin. Blood samples will be collected at defined times to measure glycemia and the incretin (GLP-1, OXM, PYY3-36) fasting levels and responses to the meal.

Anticipated Results: In comparison with placebo, UDCA will increase insulin sensitivity, enhance glycemic control, increase postprandial incretins, and delay gastric emptying (GE) of liquids.

Significance: This study will prove that ileocolonic-release UDCA enhances glycemic control in T2DM patients.",COMPLETED,,2013-10,2017-03,2017-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,24,ACTUAL

The primary analysis of this study will test the hypothesis that the rate of all-cause severe adverse events for those receiving usual drug therapy for diabetes management plus Cycloset is not greater than that for usual drug therapy plus placebo by more than an acceptable margin. While the primary purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile of Cycloset in type 2 diabetes, any potential positive cardiovascular benefits will be evaluated as well.","Bromocriptine mesylate, an ergot derivative, is a sympatholytic dopamine D2 receptor agonist that can exert inhibitory effects on serotonin turnover in the central nervous system. It has been proposed that bromocriptine can reverse many of the metabolic alterations associated with insulin resistance and obesity by resetting central (hypothalamic) circadian organization of monoamine neuronal activities.

While Cycloset has demonstrated efficacy by reducing HbA1c, fasting and post-prandial glucose and fasting and post-prandial triglycerides, the relatively small numbers of individuals treated for type 2 diabetes during the controlled Phase III clinical trials of Cycloset did not allow for a full evaluation of the safety profile. Since persons with diabetes are already at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, it is important to examine more fully the spectrum of potential adverse or positive effects from Cycloset in a large sample of persons with diabetes. Accordingly, the present study is designed to investigate the clinical safety of treatment with Cycloset in a broad population of persons with type 2 diabetes.

To determine in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving Usual Diabetes Therapy (UDT) consisting of either diet, oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) (no more than 2), or insulin (with or without no more than 1 OHA) plus either Placebo or Cycloset:

1. Whether add-on therapy with Cycloset results in all-cause rate of serious adverse events, which are not higher than add-on therapy with Placebo.
2. Whether add-on therapy with Cycloset results in disease-specific rate of serious cardiovascular adverse events, which are not higher than add-on therapy with Placebo.

   While the primary purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile of Cycloset in type 2 diabetes, any potential positive cardiovascular benefits will be evaluated as well.

Recent research has demonstrated that access to language concordant providers increases quality of care. This project evaluates the efficacy and acceptability of a model intervention to improve second language proficiency, patient-centered communication, and clinical competency of nurse practitioner students who care for Spanish-speaking patients with diabetes.","The purpose of this randomized controlled 2-group study is to test the effect of an innovative educational intervention called Integrated Language Learning for Chronic Care (IL2L) on successful self-management of diabetes. It pursues an integrated development of second language and interpersonal communication skills that will facilitate productive interactions between Spanish-speaking nurse practitioners (NP) and limited English proficiency Hispanic patients with diabetes. The intervention targets the acquisition of language skills that facilitate communicative functions known to be effective in engaging chronically ill patients. It accelerates acquisition of these skills by adding a longitudinal clinical instruction dimension. Further, the investigators propose that the efficacy of the intervention can be demonstrated at the provider level through improved linguistic and interpersonal performance and at the patient level through improved diabetes outcomes in response to language concordance. In support of these claims, the investigators seek to achieve the following specific aims:

Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of the IL2L for Chronic Care intervention on physical and mental health outcomes for Spanish-speaking patients with diabetes. Our hypothesis is: H1: Patients in the IL2L care group will report better physical health (HbA1C, lipids, and weight), mental health (depression and anxiety) and satisfaction with their healthcare than patients in the non-IL2L care group.

Aim 2: To determine the efficacy of the IL2L for Chronic Care intervention on provider language proficiency and interpersonal communication skills. Our hypothesis is:H2: Providers exposed to the IL2L intervention will demonstrate improved Spanish language skills and interpersonal communication skills upon completion of the intervention.Specific Aim 3: To assess the acceptability of the IL2L for Chronic Care model within a graduate level nurse practitioner curriculum in a leading College of Nursing.

The study will employ a mixed-methods model to assess the efficacy and accessibility of the IL2L for Chronic Care educational intervention in The Ohio State University's College of Nursing nurse practitioner program. To achieve Aim 1, the investigators will use a randomized control trial to demonstrate efficacy of the IL2L for Chronic Care model at the patient level. The investigators will compare a group of patients exposed to providers who underwent the IL2L intervention (intervention group) and a group of patients who are undergoing standard care (comparison group). To achieve Aim 2, the investigators will use a qualitative data interaction analysis system to demonstrate improvement in Spanish language proficiency and interpersonal communication skills. To achieve Aim 3, the investigators will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures within the RE-AIM model to assess the acceptability of the IL2L for chronic care model at the program level in a nurse practitioner program in a leading College of Nursing.

The patients aged between 8- 18 will be included in the study just in a condition of using HCL Systems at least 3 months. Patients with HbA1c \>8.5 % (69 mmol/mol), celiac disease, other food allergies will be excluded. The investigators will ask to parents feeding children with a pizza margherita which contains 100 grams of carbohydrates. Even if the patients could choose to consume pizza in different restaurants, the investigators will suggest having the pizza prepared with 200 grams of dough (which contains about 100 grams of carbohydrate). To validate the results the investigators will compare, for each patient, the data of glucose sensor and insulin pump after pizza consumption with those resulting from the consumption of a meal with the same macronutrient content. Patients should not consume anything else for 12 hours after the pizza (and after the meal containing the same macronutrient content). For this reason, patients will be encouraged to have these meals for dinner.

The aim of the study is comparing pizza with another meal which contains similar macronutrients. Second goal of this study is evaluating the blood glucose profile after eating pizza comparing the competency of two different Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) Systems (Medtronic MiniMed 780 G insulin pump system, Tandem T: Slim X2 insulin pump) to manage blood glucose after eating pizza.

NCT05351476,Exercise Training and Fat Metabolism in Postmenopausal Women,Resistance Training Modulation of Fat Metabolism in Obese Postmenopausal Women,"Adipose tissue turnover plays a critical role in body weight maintenance, and obesity is underscored by the dysregulated balance between fat breakdown and synthesis. Although there are clear health-related benefits of physical activity, little is known about how resistance exercise, as opposed to endurance exercise, can reduce the risk of metabolic disorders, particularly in women. The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the effectiveness of resistance training to improve basal and stimulated fat metabolism in postmenopausal women with obesity and pre-diabetes, potentially serving as a viable and practical approach to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.","The primary objective is to compare the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training to endurance training with respect to whole-body and regional lipolytic (fat breakdown) responses to acute walking exercise, (Aim 1), local adrenergic receptor blockade (Aim 2) and in response to insulin during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (Aim 3). The investigators will study the lipolytic response in the context of acute exercise, whole-body fat oxidation and resting energy expenditure data. The investigators will collect data on chronic lipogenesis (fat synthesis) and adipogenesis (fat cell formation), as well as on ambulatory blood glucose control. Microdialysis techniques will be utilized to determine the lipolytic rate in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue at rest, as well as during and after physical activity (walking) or during a hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp (including thigh muscle), before and after 12 weeks of either resistance training or endurance training. To investigate the adrenergic regulation of lipolysis before, during, and after exercise, a saline/ ethanol solution will be perfused (to monitor blood flow) through three separate microdialysis probes in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue. The perfusate in the probes will consist of either: 1) no additional substances (control probe) to address Aim 1; or 2) phentolamine, an alpha adrenoreceptor blocker (treatment probe), and 3) propranolol, a beta adrenoreceptor blocker (second treatment probe) to address Aim 2. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps will be performed to study the whole-body (with stable isotope tracers) and regional (with microdialysis) antilipolytic effect of insulin, as well as to measure insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose metabolism, before and after the training programs for Aim 3. Immediately following the controlled laboratory experiments, glycerol profiles (index of lipolysis) and glucose profiles (index of glucose control) will continue to be monitored in the participant's free-living environment over the ensuing 18 hours until the following morning. Additionally, at weeks 4 and 12 participants will come to the lab for adipose tissue biopsies of the abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue for determination of adipogenesis and lipogenesis using stable-isotope-labeled water they will drink daily over this eight-week labeling period. Additional measures of fat oxidation as well as chronic and acute fat deposition will allow interpretation of lipolysis in the context of fat oxidation and fat accumulation, while 24-hour lipolysis and glucose profile measures will allow investigation of fat metabolism and glucose control in a free-living condition. These studies will provide a greater understanding of how these exercise modalities affect metabolism in women with obesity and prediabetes, allowing practitioners to make more evidence based exercise prescriptions intended to improve body composition, glycemic control, and weight management.

The sample size for these studies will consist of 120 participants that will be randomly assigned via computer randomization to either resistance training (n=60) or endurance training (n=60) for 12 weeks. This sample size gives sufficient statistical power to detect differences in lipolytic rate and other outcome variables, as determined by previous studies examining similar outcome measures. A combination of stable tracers will be infused into the bloodstream to examine various measures of fat metabolism under resting and exercise conditions, as well as during a procedure that mimics a meal (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp). However, these various tracers can interfere with each other if studied altogether. Therefore these respective isotope tracer measures will be run in only one-half of the participants from each Aim. 30 participants in the endurance training group and 30 participants in the resistance training group will complete Aims 1 and 2. A different 30 participants in the endurance training group and 30 in the resistance training group will complete Aim 3. Among the 60 participants (30 from each exercise training group) completing Aims 1 and 2, there will be 15 individuals from each exercise training group who will be randomized to undergo the tracer measures during exercise while the other 15 from each exercise training group addressing Aims 1 and 2 will complete the exercise protocol without the tracer methods. These randomization methods will also be applied to the 60 participants completing Aim 3, although these participants will undergo a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with or without the tracer methods.

Participants will be recruited, screened, enrolled, and tested during months 4-55 of this grant. Participant recruitment procedures and procurement of needed supplies will occur during the first 3 months of the project. Additional recruitment, as well as screening and testing of participants will occur at 1-2 per month over the ensuing 52 months. Two microdialysis experiments will be performed on participants, one before and one after 12 weeks of exercise training, for a total of 240 microdialysis experiments. This plan will therefore require 4-5 microdialysis tests per month on average during the testing months. Stable label palmitate and glycerol isotope experiments will be conducted in 30 of the 60 participants undergoing the acute walking microdialysis experiments and in 30 of the 60 participants undergoing the clamp experiment. Deuterium water isotope experiments (studies of lipogenesis and adipogenesis) will be conducted in 60 of the participants.",RECRUITING,,2022-05-20,2027-04-30,2027-04-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,120,ESTIMATED

NCT05620927,Hypoglycemia Awareness Study in Diabetes Type 1,Clinical Factors Determining the Occurrence of Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycemia (IAH) in Adult Patients With Type 1 Diabetes,"The goal of this observational study is to assess clinical factors associated with the occurrence of impaired hypoglycemia awareness in adult patients with type 1 diabetes

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Determination of the prevalence of impaired hypoglycemia awareness (IAH) in adult patients with type 1 diabetes in the Polish population.
2. Assessment of the clinical usefulness of commonly used standardized scales for the assessment of IAH.
3. Determination of the clinical factors associated with the occurrence of impaired hypoglycemia awareness in adult patients with type 1 diabetes.
4. Determination of the relationship between the occurrence of IAH and the diagnosis of cardiac autonomic neuropathy.
5. Determination of the relationship between impaired hypoglycemia awareness in adult patients with type 1 diabetes and the occurrence of cognitive impairment.

Participants will:

* fill the standard questionnaires regarding hypoglycemia awareness: Gold, Clarck, HypoA-Q.
* have late complications of diabetes checked
* have procedure of cardiac autonomic neuropathy assessment
* have standard laboratory evaluation during hospitalization","Hypoglycemia defined as a blood glucose level ≤70 mg / dL is the most common acute complication in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Hypoglycemia is accompanied by alarm symptoms caused by neuroglycopenia and stimulation of the autonomic nervous system caused by the response of counterregulatory hormones. Being aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia helps patients to recognize hypoglycemia and begin self-treatment. In people experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, the counter-regulatory hormonal response may be abnormal, reducing the perception of hypoglycemia. This condition is called impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and affects up to 40% of T1D patients. IAH is the reduction or loss of the ability to recognize low blood glucose and respond correctly to the onset of hypoglycemia. It is a significant clinical problem among patients with T1D. IAH exposes patients to severe hypoglycemia, which is associated with impaired consciousness and damage to nerve cells. Therefore, patients with T1D with IAH may feel fear of developing hypoglycemia, which often results in a lack of compliance with the rules of insulin therapy, and thus difficulties in achieving good glycemic control. This can result in chronic hyperglycemia and the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications.

Common episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to disturbances in the development and maturation of neurons, resulting in cognitive impairment, structural changes in the central nervous system, lower levels of intellectual abilities, and behavioral disturbances. MRI studies in patients with T1D and IAH showed brain changes including gray matter and white matter. These changes correlate with the frequency of severe hypoglycemia and, in some areas of the brain, with the severity of IAH.

Hypoglycemia unawareness may also be due to the presence of diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). CAN is an established factor associated with severe hypoglycemia. By reducing the catecholamine counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia as well as the severity of autonomic warning symptoms, CAN may contribute to IAH. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening for CAN in patients with impaired hypoglycemia awareness. However, the relationship between CAN and IAH has not been well established. Few data suggested CAN as a possible cause of IAH, however, further studies in patients with T1D ruled out the association of CAN with IAH. Olsen et al. assessed the relationship of IAH with the presence of CAN and peripheral neuropathy in a group of 66 patients with a 31-year history of T1D. The study showed that adults with IAH compared to the control group (adults with T1D without IAH) did not differ in the incidence of CAN and peripheral neuropathy. Paes et al. in the group of 98 patients with a 13-year duration of CT1 also observed no difference in the incidence of CAN among patients with IAH compared to those with T1D without IAH. However, they confirmed the relationship between age, diabetes duration, number of severe hypoglycemic episodes, and creatinine clearance with IAH. Patients with IAH had a longer T1D duration and lower creatinine clearance compared to the control group. Moreover, in people with impaired hypoglycemia awareness, the number of severe hypoglycemia episodes was higher compared to those with normal hypoglycemia.

A simple and widely used method of assessing hypoglycemia awareness is the use of validated questionnaires in which patients report specific situations in their life related to hypoglycemia. Four questionnaires are known to diagnose awareness of hypoglycemia: Gold, Clarke, Pedersen-Bjergaard, and HypoA-Q. The advantage of using the above-mentioned questionnaires as a method of assessing hypoglycemia awareness is non-invasiveness, no / minimal cost, reporting experiences from actual episodes of hypoglycemia, the possibility of use in large patient populations, and the possibility of clinical application.

Identifying the factors that influence IAH could help draw attention to patients at risk of its consequences. Then, they could undergo hypoglycemia training, education to optimize insulin dosing, or stricter control, e.g. thanks to the use of continuous glucose monitoring systems.

Methods:

Observational, single-center study

1. Inclusion of 245 consecutive patients (women and men over 18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes, with disease duration\> 10 years, hospitalized at the Department of Internal Medicine and Diabetology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences
2. Assessment of the level of hypoglycemia awareness using standardized questionnaires: HYPOA-Q, Clarke, Gold. These are the three most commonly used scales for assessing the IAH. The endpoint, i.e. impaired hypoglycemic awareness, will be any abnormal result in one of the following scales indicating IAH (HYPOA-Q score above the median in the study population, Gold and Clarke ≥ 4)
3. Evaluated factors from the history - age, duration of diabetes, smoking, physical activity, number of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis in life, partial clinical remission after diagnosis of diabetes, presence of comorbidities (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia), number of hours of sleep, shift work, method of insulin therapy used by the patient, A1c values from the history of the last 5 years.
4. Assessment of glycemic control from reports from continuous glucose monitoring systems and glucometers - number of hypoglycemic episodes \<54 and ≤70 mg / dL in the last 4 weeks (meter reading) or duration of hypoglycemia, mean glycemia and parameters of glucose variability
5. Daily dose of insulin
6. Anthropometric measurements: body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, body weight composition
7. Laboratory tests: performed on an empty stomach, collecting about 8 ml of venous blood and a urine sample of 50-100 ml. These are tests routinely performed in the hospital to assess metabolic control in type 1 diabetes.
8. Study of the accumulation of advanced glycation products in tissues based on the level of skin autofluorescence
9. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale - a tool for screening the assessment of mild cognitive impairment. The 10-minute test allows you to assess attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visual and spatial functions, conceptual thinking, calculation skills and orientation. The maximum number of points that can be obtained is 30. A score below 26 points suggests a cognitive impairment.
10. Hypoglycemia Fear Survey - questionnaire assessing fear of hypoglycemia in the last four weeks.
11. Tests for the presence of chronic complications of diabetes mellitus: diabetic retinopathy, diabetic kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy:

Expected results:

1. In the opinion of experts, the prevalence of IAH in the Polish population in adult patients with type 1 diabetes with disease duration over 10 years is estimated at least 20%. We assume N = (the literature says that there may be about 3.5 million diabetic patients in Poland, of which about 10% is DM1), therefore N = 35,000, then I assume that the fraction p = 20% and the significance level p = 0.05 and the permissible estimation error e = 5%, therefore the minimum necessary number is n = 245.
2. The scales used to assess IAH have different clinical utilities. The HYPOA-Q scale allows us to recognize the problem of IAH in more patients (higher sensitivity).
3. Determination of clinical factors independently related to the incidence of IAH. Expected independent factors related to IAH are age, disease duration, lifetime number of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, duration of hypoglycemia or number of hypoglycemia in the last 4 weeks, and macroangiopathy.
4. Determination of the relationship between the occurrence of IAH and the diagnosis of cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Expected confirmation of the existence of such a relationship.
5. Confirmation of the relationship between impaired hypoglycemia awareness in adult patients with type 1 diabetes and the occurrence of cognitive impairment.",UNKNOWN,,2022-11-24,2023-12-31,2023-10-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,245,ESTIMATED
NCT03046927,Vitamin D and Residual Beta-Cell Function in Type 1 Diabetes,Vitamin D and Residual Beta-Cell Function in Type 1 Diabetes,This project is designed to study the role of vitamin D supplementation on the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes in children who are on standardized insulin treatment. The results could lead to significant changes in the approach to the early phase of type 1 diabetes with a strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase by using vitamin D and maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin regimen. The overall goal is to reduce the long-term complications of type 1 diabetes.,"Prolonging the duration of the partial clinical remission (PCR), or 'honeymoon' phase, of type 1 diabetes (T1D) improves glycemic control and reduces long-term complications. Recent studies suggest the exciting possibility that vitamin D supplementation, a safe and easy-to-implement therapy in children, may lengthen PCR and increase residual beta cell function (RBCF).

However, existing studies employed a suboptimal vitamin D dose or lacked a standardized insulin treatment protocol, precluding solid conclusions and preventing the field from moving forward with translation to clinical practice. This trial's rationale is to securely establish the effect of an adequate dose of vitamin D on PCR and RBCF.

We hypothesize that vitamin D will increase RBCF and prolong PCR. The primary aim is to determine the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on RBCF and PCR in youth with T1D maintained on a standardized insulin protocol. We propose a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of ergocalciferol vs. placebo in 40 subjects of 10-21 years with newly-diagnosed T1D. The primary outcome is the change over time in stimulated C-peptide (a measure of RBCF). Secondary outcomes include change over time in insulin-dose-adjusted-hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) (IDAA1C; a measure of PCR), HbA1c, and total daily dose of insulin. Mechanistic studies will explore whether beneficial effects of vitamin D are associated with increased GLP-1 levels or decreased inflammatory markers, and whether response to vitamin D is impacted by T1D-risk polymorphisms. If our hypotheses are true, these findings may completely alter the approach to the early management of T1D, with strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase using a readily available and easily affordable vitamin D while maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin treatment regimen.",COMPLETED,,2017-10-19,2021-04-20,2021-04-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2|PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,48,ACTUAL
NCT00847327,Parental Management of Young Children's Diabetes,Parenting and Control Among Young Children With Type 1 Diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong metabolic disorder that affects 1 out of every 400-600 American children each year, with many children being diagnosed at younger and younger ages.

To achieve proper diabetes control, it is necessary to conform or adhere one's behavior to a physician-prescribed diabetes self-care regimen. As such, parents of children with Type 1 diabetes must be highly involved in managing their child's disease on a daily basis, especially parents of affected children who are very young and more highly dependent upon parental caretaking.

As children diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at a very young age may be at an increased risk for the development of long-term behavioral and medical complications, more research is needed to understand and treat the leading contributors to diabetes-related parental distress and medical outcomes among this growing subgroup.

Recent findings indicate that responsibility for diabetes management falls heavily on mothers. The majority of families do not receive outside child care assistance and report feeling overwhelmed. Parents report high levels of pediatric parenting stress difficulty, as well as moderate symptoms of anxiety. The current study aims to expand such preliminary findings and specifically examine the effects of a newly-developed parenting support program for parents of young children with Type 1 diabetes. The utility of the intervention will be evaluated. It is hypothesized that parents completing the parent support program will report lower levels of psychosocial distress and improved quality of life. It is hypothesized that the children of participating parents will also demonstrate improved quality of life and metabolic control.","Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong metabolic disorder that affects 1 out of every 400-600 American children each year, with many children being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. If Type 1 diabetes is not properly controlled, it can lead to a host of devastating disease-related complications later in life. Therefore, achieving proper diabetes control during childhood is an important public health issue.

To achieve proper diabetes control, it is necessary to conform or adhere one's behavior to a physician-prescribed diabetes self-care regimen consisting of multiple insulin administrations and blood glucose (BG) checks daily, as well as pay careful attention to diet and exercise. As such, parents of children with Type 1 diabetes must be highly involved in managing their child's disease on a daily basis, especially parents of affected children who are very young and more highly dependent upon parental caretaking.

It is not surprising that the experience of managing a child's diabetes can be demanding, overwhelming, and stressful for some parents, and may even significantly impair parental psychosocial well being. Further, difficulties achieving proper diabetes control have been reported to occur among parents of children of all ages, including parents of those who are very young.

Operationally, these psychosocial well being and diabetes outcomes can be examined by assessing: (1) parental symptoms of depression, anxiety, diabetes parenting stress, and perceived social support, and (2) metabolic control, which may be measured with the quarterly HbA1C counts.

As children diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at a very young age may be at an increased risk for the development of long-term behavioral and medical complications due to the aforementioned difficulties (on the part of their parents), more research is needed to understand and treat the leading contributors to diabetes-related parental distress (depression, anxiety, stress, social support) and medical outcomes among this growing subgroup.

Recent findings indicate that responsibility for diabetes management falls heavily on mothers, who report performing 79% of their children's injections and 70% of blood glucose checks (Mednick, 2005). The majority of families do not receive outside child care assistance and report feeling overwhelmed. Parents report high levels of pediatric parenting stress difficulty, as well as moderate symptoms of anxiety. The current study aims to expand such preliminary findings and specifically examine the effects of a newly-developed parenting support program for parents of young children with Type 1 diabetes. The utility of the intervention will be evaluated. It is hypothesized that parents completing the parent support program will report lower levels of psychosocial distress and improved quality of life. It is hypothesized that the children of participating parents will also demonstrate improved quality of life and metabolic control.

Evaluating this intervention is a first step in the long-term goal of improving diabetes health outcomes for young children. Understanding the usefulness of this intervention can help us to further refine intervention programs for parents of young children with Type 1 diabetes that best meet their unique needs and risks.",COMPLETED,,2008-04,2013-08,2013-08,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,134,ACTUAL
NCT06606327,Diazoxide Suppression Test P&F Study,Human Models of Primary Hyperinsulinemia: Diazoxide Suppression Test (DzST) Pilot & Feasibility Study,"The goal of this study is to learn about how the hormone insulin controls blood sugar. The main question it aims to answer is about how much insulin the body actually needs to maintain a normal blood sugar level. People with obesity and high insulin levels will receive eight doses of diazoxide, a drug that suppresses the pancreas's production of insulin, and will have their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels checked daily while taking the drug.","The investigators are interested in determining to what extent the hyperinsulinemia commonly associated with insulin resistance (IR) in those at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a primary phenomenon, rather than merely a secondary, compensatory response to IR. The study hypothesis is that some people with obesity and hyperinsulinemia exhibit a primary, non-compensatory hyperinsulinemia that may foment IR and its dysmetabolic sequelae. If this were the case, lowering insulin levels should not result in a proportional rise in blood glucose as might be expected if the hyperinsulinemia truly were purely compensatory. This hypothesis has been difficult to prove, however, because of the tight feedback mechanism between blood glucose and insulin secretion; under normal circumstances insulin secretion declines only alongside blood glucose. As such, an attempt to lower insulin levels independently of blood glucose will raise blood glucose and trigger further insulin secretion, negating the purpose of the experiment. In order to circumvent this feedback regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the study team has developed a modification of the insulin suppression test (IST) called the ""graded IST"" (GIST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with octreotide and then measures steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) at both replacement euinsulinemia and hyperinsulinemia. It is expected that some people with high insulin levels at baseline will not demonstrate a prominent rise in SSPG even when their insulin levels are lowered. However, the GIST is a cumbersome procedure that is difficult to scale for larger study populations. As such, the investigators are also working to develop an outpatient diazoxide suppression test (DzST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with the oral insulin anti-secretagogue diazoxide rather than octreotide, and will validate it against the incipient ""gold-standard"" GIST. GIST participants found to have evidence of primary hyperinsulinemia (i.e., euinsulinemic euglycemia or near-euglycemia despite baseline hyperinsulinemia) will, several weeks later, take diazoxide 3 mg/kg per dose, twice daily, for four days. The investigators will check fasting glucose and insulin levels daily at baseline and then after each of the four days of diazoxide administration. The investigators expect that suppression of insulin secretion with diazoxide will, in accordance with the GIST, lead to no significant rise in blood glucose in people who have true primary hyperinsulinemia.",RECRUITING,,2024-10-23,2026-01,2025-11,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,BASIC_SCIENCE,10,ESTIMATED

Compare these changes in glycemic control after different techniques for bariatric surgery","Obesity and its ensuing metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are exponentially increasing worldwide. \* \* The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. \* Different bariatric procedures are available. In the 1960's, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was developed, in which the stomach is divided with staplers to create a small gastric pouch, while the jejunum is divided 30 to 50 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The distal limb is then anastomosed to the small gastric pouch and a jejunojejunostomy is performed 50 to 150 cm distal from the gastrojejunostomy. Sleeve gastrectomy on the other hand, reduces the stomach size by vertical stapling. In the 1990's, gastric banding was developed, reducing the volume of the stomach by annular banding. The amount of excess body weight reduction varies among the different techniques, with 60% to 70% reported for RYGB\*, 55% for sleeve gastrectomy\* and up to 65% for gastric banding\*. Worldwide, it is estimated that a total of 344000 procedures were performed in 2008. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was the most common (47%) followed by gastric banding (42%) and sleeve gastrectomy (5%).\*

In 1987, Pories et al. published data on the stunning observation that 99% of obese patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance that had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass became and remained euglycemic after surgery.\* Since then, all commonly used bariatric procedures have been shown to restore a normal glucose profile in many diabetes patients. Current data suggest that the bypass procedures are more effective in doing so, with success rates up to 80%,\* than the purely restrictive procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric banding, with success rates varying between 30% and 70%.\* The improvement in glycaemic control is already seen a few days after surgery, long before any substantial weight loss occurs.

Although different reasons for the rapid amelioration in glycaemic control are discussed in literature, the exact underlying mechanisms are still not understood. In the restrictive procedures, the effect is thought to be mainly mediated by caloric restriction and the ensuing reduction in body weight and improvement in insulin resistance.\* The malabsorptive procedures, such as RYGB, offer different explanatory possibilities. In the so-called 'fore-gut hypothesis', it is suggested that the exclusion of the duodenum and proximal jejunum may reduce insulin resistance. \* The 'hind-gut hypothesis' on the other hand, suggests that it is the altered delivery of nutrients to the distal small bowel that causes exaggerated responses of the gut hormones. These gut hormones act as anorectic agents and as incretins that stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to restore normal first phase insulin response. \*

Most studies to investigate the alterations in glucose metabolism are performed weeks to months after surgery. There are limited data on the evolution of blood glucose in the first days and weeks after RYGB.\* However, to our knowledge, no such data exist on the glycaemic control immediately after sleeve gastrectomy and gastric banding. With the present study we document the evolution in glycaemic control immediately after RYGB, sleeve gastrectomy and gastric banding in type 2 diabetic subjects.",COMPLETED,,2012-09,2018-03,2018-03,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,33,ACTUAL

However, the randomized controlled trials in prediabetes are limited to evaluate the effects of coffee. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of coffee on metabolic factors and inflammation in individuals with prediabetes and obesity. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial is designed to explore the effects of coffee consumption on participants with prediabetes and obesity. A total of 100 eligible participants with prediabetes and obesity will be recruited from the Health Management Center of Nanjing First Hospital. These participants are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the coffee capsule group or the control group. The coffee capsule group will be instructed to consume 3.6 g of coffee capsules per day (0.3 g per capsule, 6 capsules per serving, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the middle of the day). The control group will be asked to consume 3.6 g of cornstarch capsules (0.3 g per capsule, 6 capsules per serving, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the middle of the day). 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, 2-week blinded continuous glucose measurement and others will be performed before and after the 3-month intervention. During the three months of intervention, the information on dietary intake, physical activity and sleep of participants will be systematically collected. To comprehensively assess the impact of coffee intake on prediabetes and obesity, we will analyze the effects of coffee capsules on various metabolic and inflammatory markers, including glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, blood pressure, adiponectin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, body mass index, body composition, the degree of hepatic steatosis and so on. We will further adjust for potential confounding factors such as lifestyle factors to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms driving this association.","Participants with both prediabetes and obesity who undergo physical examinations at the Health Management Center of Nanjing First Hospital will be recruited for this study. The details of this study design are as follows:

1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants. Inclusion criteria are as follows: 1) Age between 18 and 59 years old; 2) Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m2; 3) No consumption of coffee in the past month; 4) Provide written informed consent; 5) Abnormal glucose tolerance, as per the 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria for prediabetes, includes impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or a combination of both, with blood glucose fluctuations within an abnormal range (fasting blood glucose ≥6.1 mmol/L but \<7.0 mmol/L, and/or 2-hour glucose tolerance blood glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L but \<11.1 mmol/L). The exclusion criteria for participants include individuals who 1) have been diagnosed with diabetes or are taking anti-diabetic drugs; 2) have a history of diseases such as cancer, liver and kidney dysfunction, existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and other diseases that may affect glucose and lipid metabolism; 3) self-report gastrointestinal reaction or intolerance to coffee and reject coffee consumption; 4) are pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the near future; 5) are deemed unsuitable to participate in this study by researcher believes that they are not to participate in this study.

2. Sample size calculation: Based on the estimation of research purpose, research design, expected effect size, and statistical analysis method, the sample size is determined to be 100 cases, including fifty cases in the intervention group and fifty cases in the control group.

3. Definition of the intervention group and placebo group: the intervention group serves as the coffee capsule group, and will receive 3.6 g of coffee capsules per day (0.3 g/capsule, 6 capsules/time, 2 times/day, once in the morning and once in the middle of the day). The placebo group (control group) is required to consume 3.6 g of cornstarch capsules per day (0.3 g/capsule, 6 capsules/time, 2 times/day, once in the morning and once in the middle of the day).

4. Follow-up and data collection: this follow-up period will span three months. Before and after the 3-month intervention the participants will partake in:

1. regular assessments. Demographic characteristics and medical information will be collected, including age, gender, occupation, education level, income, medication history (hormones, contraceptives, etc.), and family history of chronic diseases. Besides, using questionnaires, we also collect lifestyle information such as smoking, drinking, diet intake, physical activity, and sleep of participants. Specifically, the Simplified Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ25) and 24-hour Diet Record Questionnaire (DR) are employed to assess the dietary intake of participants in the past six months and the previous 24 hours (one day each in the middle of the week and on the weekend), respectively. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is utilized to assess various aspects of physical activity, including time, frequency, and intensity. The sleep information (sleep time, sleep quality, etc.) is evaluated by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI).
2. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (75 g-OGTT). Blood samples are taken fasting and 30, 120 minutes after the glucose load. Blood samples are analyzed for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon.

The injured beta cells can then no longer make the needed amount of insulin to stay healthy. However, in the early stages of T1D, some beta cells are still alive and functioning. Treatment to protect the beta cells against injury at this time could slow the progress of disease. Denosumab is an approved treatment for osteoporosis (a disease that thins and weakens the bones), high blood calcium levels, bone cancer, and other bone problems in patients who have cancer. The research team has found that the bone pathway that denosumab works on to treat these bone conditions also has effects on the health of the beta cells. Lab studies suggest that denosumab may protect and/or increase the number of beta cells and improve how well they work. This study will test whether denosumab is safe and improves beta cell function and blood sugar control in people with early T1D.","This is a Phase 1/2, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of denosumab for improving beta cell function and glycemic control among patients with early T1D and detectable C-peptide. The efficacy of denosumab will be evaluated by changes in C-peptide level during mixed meal tolerance test and achieving a clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction at 12 months. Subjects will be followed for 12 months for adverse events and for changes in beta cell function and glycemic control parameters.

Subjects will be randomized with a 2:1 treatment to placebo ratio.

NCT04537676,Patient Empowerment Study,Patient Empowerment Study: Assessment of Quality of Life Among Patients With Diabetes Foot Ulcer,The Patient Empowerment Study is an observational longitudinal study among adults with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). The scope of this study is to better understand how a patient's DFU disease process and usage of the Podimetrics System can impact patient health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life will be measured by both the generic 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and the ulcer-specific Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale Short Form (DFS-SF) questionnaire.,"There is emerging evidence that diabetic foot complications greatly affect the quality of life of patients and cause people a significant burden to life. A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is associated with deterioration the physical, mental and social life quality. Given the detrimental effect foot ulcers have on patients, it is essential that quality of life metrics be evaluated among DFU patients. To what degree can diabetic foot ulcers affect the quality of life of patients? What are the facilitators and barriers to an improved quality of life?

To gain insight into these questions Podimetrics researchers will be conducting a longitudinal study among patients suffering with a DFU. The general purpose of the study is to evaluate the current quality of life of DFU patients from the subject perspective in various domains including physical functioning, general health perception, psychological, social functioning, vitality and role limitations. The study will also explore the relationships between HRQoL and usage of the Podimetrics System. Improved understanding of patients' subjective evaluation of their quality of life, and the role of the Podimetrics System, will help clinicians provide better care for these patients.

A cohort of DFU patients will be recruited upon providing informed consent. Participant lifestyle and ulcer status information is collected by a background survey. HRQoL is assessed at baseline, 6 month and 12 month using questionnaires. The investigators intend to use two types of questionnaires for HRQoL evaluation in this study: one generic questionnaire, SF-36, which addresses general quality of life issues, and one specific questionnaire, DFS-SF, which addresses issues specific to diabetic foot diseases, such as ulcer severity and impact of ulcer care.",UNKNOWN,,2020-09-15,2022-03-01,2021-10-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,200,ESTIMATED

All over the world obesity reaches epidemic proportions. Obesity is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, a multi-factorial disease that increases the presence of multiple health problems. Until now, exercise and dietary intervention seem to be the single most effective interventions to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In obesity and type 2 diabetes, not only fat accumulation in adipose tissue, but also fat accumulation in the peripheral tissues occurs. Fat accumulation in peripheral tissues has been associated with insulin resistance. Exercise seems to have a positive effect on the accumulation of fat in the peripheral tissue and on the insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients.

In this study we want to investigate if a prolonged exercise training program can lower the intrahepatic lipid content and can improve the metabolism of the liver in type 2 diabetic patients and patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and to examine if this leads to improvements in metabolic risk markers.

Accelerated microvascular disease may produce blindness, end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and limb ischemia. Strategies to prevent or delay microvascular disease have the potential to improve the lives of millions and prevent catastrophic illness. The major focus of prevention of microvascular disease in diabetes has been on the endothelium and its role in protection of blood vessels. An unexpected means to prevent microvascular disease in diabetes may be coupled to the function of vitamin C in red blood cells (RBCs) of diabetic subjects. Based on new and emerging data, vitamin C concentrations in RBCs may be inversely related to glucose concentrations found in diabetes. Based on animal data, we hypothesize that RBCs with low vitamin C levels may have decreased deformability, leading to slower flow in capillaries and microvascular hypoxia, the hallmark of diabetic microangiopathy. Low vitamin C concentrations in RBCs of diabetic subjects may be able to be increased, by using vitamin C supplements. Findings in animals may not accurately reflect effects in humans because of species differences in mechanisms of vitamin C entry into RBCs. Therefore, clinical research is essential to characterize vitamin C physiology in RBCs of diabetic subjects. In this protocol we will investigate physiology of vitamin C in RBCs of diabetic subjects as a function of glycemia, without vitamin C supplementation (stage 1) and with vitamin C supplementation (stage 2). We will screen type II diabetic subjects on insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medication(s) and select those with hemoglobin A1C concentrations of less than or equal to 12%. Selected subjects may be hospitalized twice, each time for approximately one week. The primary objective of the first hospitalization (stage 1) will be to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on vitamin C RBC physiology regardless of baseline vitamin C concentrations (without any vitamin C supplementation). The second hospitalization (stage 2) investigates the effect (if any) of vitamin C supplementation to changes in RBC physiology during euglycemic and hyperglycemic states. As inpatients, subjects will have two venous sampling periods each of approximately 24 hours. On admission, subjects may be fitted with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), oral hypoglycemic agents will be discontinued, and basal-bolus insulin regimen initiated. Insulin doses will be clinically determined and titrated to achieve euglycemia (fasting and pre-meal glucoses \<140mg/dl) prior to the first sampling period (euglycemic sampling). The first sampling period will be performed under conditions of euglycemic control for 24 hours. The second sampling period will be performed under controlled hyperglycemia induced by withholding basal and bolus insulin and providing a high carbohydrate load diet (70-75% carbohydrate). Correction-scale insulin will be provided for glucoses \>350-400mg/dl. Hyperglycemia will not exceed 9 hours, and will be reversed by reinstituting insulin.

During the two sampling periods, samples will be withdrawn via venous catheter for RBC deformability, vitamin C concentrations and other related research studies. Following completion of stage 1, subjects considered for participation in stage 2 will be provided a prescription for vitamin C 500mg twice daily. Given that vitamin C and vitamin E are related antioxidants, and that both vitamins appear to be associated with RBC rigidity, diabetic subjects may also be given a prescription for 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E (RRR alpha tocopherol) daily. Subjects will continue vitamin C and E supplementation for a minimum of 8 weeks depending on RBC vitamin C concentrations. To evaluate any effect of vitamin E supplementation, plasma and RBC vitamin E levels may be measured concurrently with vitamin C levels during various phases of stages 1 and 2. All subjects will be seen as outpatients at biweekly or monthly intervals with regular measurement of plasma and RBC vitamin C concentrations. Target RBC vitamin C concentration \>30uM is required prior to stage 2 inpatient sampling studies. Vitamins C and E supplementation will be discontinued upon inpatient admission for stage 2. Risk of both vitamin supplements are minimal as both supplementation doses are safe. Outcomes are to measure RBC rigidity and vitamin concentrations before and after supplementation. After a minimum of 8 weeks (depending on RBC vitamin C levels), subjects will be hospitalized again, and sampling repeated as described.

Review of literature

Empagliflozin is a selective SGLT-2 inhibitor, recently approved by the U.S. FDA for use in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes provided sustained glycemic control and weight loss over 90 weeks and was generally well tolerated (1). Another study demonstrated that Empagliflozin in patients with T2DM resulted in reductions in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and reductions in body weight compared with placebo. Empagliflozin was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile (2). Some congeners of this class of molecules have been seen to reduce liver fat content in rat models. However, the effect of this drug on liver fat content in humans has not been evaluated.

Research question

Does Empagliflozin reduce liver fat content in patients with T2DM and fatty liver disease?

Aim of the study

To study the effect of Empagliflozin on liver fat content in patients with T2DM

Primary objective

1. To evaluate the change in liver fat content from baseline at week 12

   Secondary objective
2. To evaluate the changes from baseline in pancreatic fat content, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat content at 12 weeks

Material and Methods

Ethical considerations

The trial protocol will be submitted to Medanta ethics committees for approval. The trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the patients will be provided with written informed consent before participation.

Patients and study area A total of 100 patients will be enrolled for the study. Consecutive patients attending outpatient Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes for management of diabetes will be enrolled.

Sample Size Calculation:

Assumptions: Change in liver fat content from baseline to week 12 in Empagliflozin dose group (m1) = 6.0 unit Change in liver fat content from baseline to week 12 in Standard dose group (m2) = 10.0 unit

Confidence level -95%, Power - 80%, Coefficient of variation = 80% Formula for sample size calculation: n = (Zα+Zβ)2 \* (σ12 + σ22)) / (m1-m2)2, where Zα is the value of normal distribution corresponding to desired confidence level, Zβ is the value of the Normal distribution corresponding to desired power, σ1 and σ2 are the standard deviation of the two groups. With these assumptions the sample size per group works out as 50.

Randomization

SPSS software will be used to generate 100 random numbers between 000 to 999. The random numbers will be divided by 2 and the reminder noted. The reminders 0, \& 1 will correspond to Empagliflozin dose and standard dose group respectively. It will be ensured that these are equal in number.

Opaque envelopes will be prepared with serial number on the top and the assigned group inside the envelope.

After recruiting the subjects the envelop with corresponding serial number will be opened and the subjects assign to the relevant groups.

Statistical Analysis Plan:

The analysis will include profiling of patients on different demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters etc. Quantitative data will be presented in terms of means and standard deviation and qualitative/categorical data will be presented as absolute numbers and proportions. Cross tabulation will be generated and chi square test will be used for testing of association. Student t test will be used for comparison of quantitative outcome parameters and standard normal deviate test for proportions. P-value \< 0.05 is considered statistically significant. SPSS software will be used for analysis.

All patients will be randomized to one of the following intervention groups: group I (n = 50): T2DM patients receiving standard care for T2DM (metformin, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitor or insulin, in any combination) plus 10 mg of Empagliflozin per day and group II (n = 50): Standard care for T2DM upgraded without Empagliflozin.

Liver fat content, pancreatic fat content, visceral and subcutaneous fat content will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proton density fat Fraction (PDFF) at the beginning of study and again after 12 weeks of intervention. PDFF is emerging as a leading MR-based biomarker for noninvasive quantification of hepatic steatosis (3, 4). Multiple human studies have shown that this method accurately estimates PDFF in the liver. Based on these results, this magnitude-based PDFF estimation method now is being used to quantify liver fat in clinical practice in several institutions in the United States and is being used as a biomarker of drug efficacy and drug toxicity by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and industry in clinical trials (5, 6). This method has been shown to be both accurate, and reproducible (7).

Fatty liver will also be assessed by ultrasonography of liver at the beginning of study and again after 12 weeks of intervention. On ultrasonography, severity of fatty liver will be quantitated using a scoring system (0 = no fatty liver, 1 = mild fatty liver, 2 = moderate fatty liver and 3 = severe fatty liver). Automated body composition analyzer (BCA) will also be used to assess body composition at 0 and 12 weeks.

Laboratory workup Biochemical parameters will include fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), lipid profile, hemogram, kidney function test (urea, creatinine) and liver function test (total and fractionated bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total protein, albumin) before and after the intervention period.

The primary end point

1. Change in liver fat content from baseline at week 12 The secondary end points
2. Change in pancreatic fat content, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat content from baseline at week 12

NCT03506776,Foot Intervention Study Utilizing Commercially Available Infrared Thermometers With Individuals With Diabetes,Foot Intervention Study Utilizing Commercially Available Infrared Thermometers With Individuals With Diabetes Using a Mixed Methods Approach,"Foot self-management is important in preventing diabetic foot ulcers. However, even when individuals care for their feet, the signs of inflammation are often missed. A tool that will identify inflammation, a sign of initial tissue damage, may be needed. Previous research has shown that foot temperature self-monitoring reduced ulcer incidence by providing a warning sign of inflammation. However, these studies used an expensive medical thermometer. The objectives for this mixed-methods study are: (1) to determine if a foot health intervention that utilizes an inexpensive commercially-available infrared thermometer (CAIT) improves foot outcomes for individuals with diabetes; (2) to identify factors impacting foot self-management; (3) and to explore the participants', family and support persons', and healthcare providers' experiences with foot self-management and the intervention. This study will have three phases: Phase 1, patients, family and support person, and healthcare providers will share their insights regarding foot self-management to inform the intervention; Phase 2, a six-month RCT will assess the effectiveness of a CAIT; Phase 3, interviews will be conducted with participants, family and support persons, and health providers to explore their experiences with the intervention.","Diabetes is a global health emergency, which is estimated to increase throughout the 21st century (Guariguata et al., 2014). The prevalence of diabetes in Canada is increasing; in 2014, 6.7% of Canadians and 9% of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians had diabetes (Statistics Canada, 2014). In 2020 the number of people in Canada with diabetes is expected to rise to 2.5 million people, or 9.9% of the population (Canadian Diabetes Association, 2009).

Patients with diabetes are at risk for poor foot health and the estimated lifetime incidence of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) for this population is 25% (Singh, Armstrong, \& Lipsky, 2005). In Canada in 2011 DFUs and related care cost the healthcare system 547 million dollars (Hopkins, Burke, Harlock, Jegathisawaran, \& Goeree, 2015). Complicated DFUs that do not heal can lead to amputation; an estimated 85% of amputations are the result of a DFU (Canadian Association of Wound Care, 2015).

The increasing number of people with diabetes will result in a rise in foot complications such as DFUs (Canadian Diabetes Association, 2009). Therefore, it is important to develop strategies for the prevention of DFUs. An important aspect of maintaining foot health is self-management (Boulton et al., 2008; Chang, Peng, Chang, \& Chen, 2013). However, there is limited literature related to the experiences of diabetic patients with foot management (Delea et al., 2015). As a result, little is known of the factors that need to be addressed to ensure successful uptake of a self-management strategy. Further exploration of the issue of foot self-assessment and self-management with patients and health care providers is needed in order to develop and implement effective and sustainable interventions.

Interventions to prevent DFUs need to provide patients with strategies to prevent skin breakdown. Due to neuropathy individuals with diabetes do not recognize the inflammation that occurs prior to skin breakdown. In many instances, by the time individuals have identified a problem the ulceration had already occurred (Lavery et al., 2004). For patients with diabetes factors such as pressure can contribute to inflammation and increase plantar foot temperature. Commercially available-infrared thermometers (CAITs) can be used to detect this temperature increase before skin breakdown. Once the increase is identified, the individual can relieve pressure, for example by resting, until the temperature normalizes and inflammation decreases. If the temperature does not normalize in two days then a physician should be consulted. Therefore, self-management strategies that focus on identifying and addressing early signs of inflammation, such as a temperature increase, may be effective in preventing skin breakdown.

Various systematic reviews, which contained three randomized control trials (RCTs), have indicated that the use of personal temperature monitoring with a medical grade thermometer was an effective way to predict, and thus prevent DFUs (Arad, Fonseca, Peters, \& Vinik, 2011; Houghton, Bower, \& Chant, 2013; van Netten et al., 2015). These thermometers cost approximately $700, which can be prohibitively expensive. A recent study compared inexpensive CAITs, that cost under $100, to medical infrared thermometers and found them to be a reliable measure of skin temperature (Mufti, Coutts, \& Sibbald, 2015). However, this technology has not been used as part of an intervention and it is unknown if the CAIT will result in the same positive results as the medical grade thermometer. This study will fill this empirical gap.

The Canadian Diabetes Association's position statement on amputation prevention calls for affordable and timely access to devices, education, and care (Canadian Diabetes Association., 2015). Use of a CAIT may potentially meet this need and offers a low-cost self-management tool to prevent skin breakdown. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to determine if a self-management strategy that utilizes a low-cost CAIT is effective to prevent DFUs. Through engagement with patients and healthcare providers this research will also examine factors impacting self-management not addressed in prior studies and utilize this information to inform the intervention.

Phase 1 (Qualitative) Purposive convenience sampling will be utilized in Phase 1 and patients, support persons, and healthcare providers will be selected that will inform the researcher about issues with foot self-management. To gain a comprehensive understanding of foot self-management, participants will be selected who have a variety of experiences and characteristics, such as patients with diabetes with various foot health challenges and healthcare providers with different professional designations such as physicians and nurses. Semi-structured interviews lasting 20-30 minutes will be conducted at a mutually convenient location over six-weeks. All interviews will be recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis to identify themes and recommendations for the intervention. For example, a finding from Phase 1 may be that patients are not sure what information to communicate to their healthcare provider about their feet. Such a finding would be addressed by incorporating into the intervention further education about communication and potentially a checklist that the patients can use to take with them for appointments.

Phase 2 (RCT) Using a list of randomly generated numbers patients will be assigned to the intervention or control group. The control group and intervention group will receive foot self-management education. The content of the education will be finalized following completion of Phase 1. The education will be provided in video format utilizing the Canadian Association of Wound Care (CAWC) diabetic foot management YouTube video and one-on-one teaching. Both groups will be provided with an inspection mirror with an extendable handle to assist with visualizing the bottom of the feet and a pedometer to measure daily activity. Additionally, the intervention group will receive a CAIT. Education on use of the CAIT will be provided through demonstration using a foot model and CAIT. The foot model will be marked with a zigzag pattern on the plantar surface to illustrate the path that should be used when measuring temperature. The support person will be included in the teaching if he/she will be assisting the participant to obtain temperature readings. The participant will also be provided with a letter explaining the study to take to his/her healthcare provider.

Data collection is the same for both groups with the addition of foot temperature measurement for the intervention group. The initial one-hour intake session will take place in the participant's home or at Memorial University School of Nursing and will include completing baseline assessments and distributing requisitions for bloodwork and the orthotic assessment, log books, and equipment. Use of one trained interviewer will minimize information bias during data collection.

At the end of the initial visit a second 15-minute visit will be booked with participants in the intervention group for one week later. The purpose of the second visit will be to determine if the thermometer is being used correctly and the documentation is being completed as intended. This will also be an opportunity to answer any questions. Next, the RA or researcher will contact the participant and support persons one week later (e.g.,, week 2) via phone to check if there are any questions or concerns. If the participant's concerns cannot be answered over the phone the RA or investigator will book a time to visit the participant. The log books for participants in the control group and intervention group will be picked up on a monthly basis either by the investigator or RA. A tracking form will be used to organize the timeframe for the phone calls and visits. Participants in the control group will be contacted via phone one week after the initial visit to address any questions or concerns. At three months and six months another hour-long appointment will be made with all participants to complete assessments and questionnaires.

If a participant develops an ulcer during the RCT his/her participation in the study will end but data collected will be included. A participant will be advised to immediately contact his/her physician if an area of concern is identified. Also, a participant will be asked to contact the investigator if he/she develops an ulcer.

The primary outcome is incidence of ulceration measured through physical assessment and self-report utilizing a standard definition of DFU. Secondary outcomes include any other foot-related changes, changes in satisfaction, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Confounding variables include: pedometer readings, HbA1C, orthotic assessment, temperature, depression symptoms, foot care behaviors, and information collected in the participant profile.

Phase 3 (Qualitative) At the end of the data collection of Phase 2 participants will be recruited for Phase 3. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 25 RCT participants (15 participants from the intervention group, 5 participants and their support person who assisted with measuring the foot temperature, 5 participants from the control group) and 10 healthcare providers who were consulted by participants during the intervention to obtain information about the experiences with self-management and the intervention. The interview with the participants and healthcare providers will be of 30-45 minutes duration and will take place at a mutually convenient location. The interviews with the support person will be conducted separately from the participant and will be of 20 minutes in duration. All interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. The details of the methods, including the analysis that will be utilized in phase 3, will be developed after the completion of phase 2.",COMPLETED,,2017-08-21,2019-10-30,2019-10-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,62,ACTUAL
