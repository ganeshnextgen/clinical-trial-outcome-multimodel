NCT02280694,Low Dose Metronomic Poly-chemotherapy for Metastatic CRC,Metronomic Poly-chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer at Progression Following Established Treatments: Clinical and Laboratory Research,"This study investigates the activity of a new regimen of treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. This includes a combination of well-known chemotherapy agents and anti-inflammatory agents, when administered orally at low daily doses and without planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen), in contrast with the conventional and already exhausted regimens of treatment at Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD) which required pre-planned brakes between treatment days.","Patients suffering from metastases of colorectal cancer whose tumor cells develop resistance to conventionally administered treatments are in need for new methods of treatment.

While their chemotherapy had been administered up till then at the classical regimen of Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD), which is aimed to directly killing maximal fractions of tumor cells, the present study evaluates the clinical benefit of a treatment which is based on old chemotherapeutic and old anti-inflammatory drugs, when these are administered at low doses,on daily basis and orally taken, without planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen).

Treatments based on this type of regimen have already been studied on other models of cancer and showed the capacity of suppressing tumor growth by a new category of anti-tumor effects. Namely, by affecting factors and mechanisms which prevail in the microenvironment that surrounds tumor deposits, thus circumventing the resistance of their cancer cells to chemotherapy.",COMPLETED,,2015-01,2019-12,2019-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,45,ACTUAL

NCT04329494,"PIPAC for the Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in Patients With Ovarian, Uterine, Appendiceal, Colorectal, or Gastric Cancer","Safety and Efficacy of Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosolized Chemotherapy (PIPAC) in Ovarian, Uterine, Appendiceal, Colorectal, and Gastric Cancer Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC)","This phase I trial studies the side effects of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in treating patients with ovarian, uterine, appendiceal, stomach (gastric), or colorectal cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneal carcinomatosis). Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, mitomycin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PIPAC is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The study device consists of a nebulizer (a device that turns liquids into a fine mist), which is connected to a high-pressure injector, and inserted into the abdomen (part of the body that contains the digestive organs) during a laparoscopic procedure (a surgery using small incisions to introduce air and to insert a camera and other instruments in the abdominal cavity for diagnosis and/or to perform routine surgical procedures). Pressurization of the liquid chemotherapy through the study device results in aerosolization (a fine mist or spray) of the chemotherapy intra-abdominally (into the abdomen). Giving chemotherapy through PIPAC may reduce the amount of chemotherapy needed to achieve acceptable drug concentration, and therefore potentially reduces side effects and toxicities.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in 3 groups of patients: peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) due to primary ovarian, uterine, or gastric carcinoma (Arm 1); PC due to primary colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 2).

II. To evaluate safety of PIPAC and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PIPAC with MMC in patients with PC due to colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 3).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Ability to proceed to cytoreduction with/without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) (Arm 3 patients).

II. Efficacy will be assessed by:

Ia. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), if available, version 1.1 via computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline (week 10, and 6 weeks after completing treatment; and at 18 weeks).

Ib. Peritoneal regression grading score (PRGS) via biopsy at each cycle (both pre-PIPAC and post-PIPAC peritoneal samples will be obtained).

Ic. Peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) at the time of laparoscopy. II. Post-operative surgical complications by Claven-Dindo classification evaluated at 4, 10, and 16 weeks (4 weeks after each PIPAC).

III. Progression-free survival. IV. PIPAC technical failure rate. V. Patient-reported health state/quality of life and symptoms before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 weeks as measured by the European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).

VI. Functional status, as measured by the number of daily steps before and after treatments (Vivofit 4 wristband pedometer - Garmin Company).

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses imaging to provide a three-dimensional view of the area to be irradiated. Doctors can then shape and direct the radiation beams at the area from multiple directions while avoiding, as much as possible, nearby organs. TMLI is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow. Radiation therapy is given before transplant to suppress the immune system, prevent rejection of the transplanted cells, and wipe out any remaining cancer cells. TMLI may allow a greater radiation dose to be delivered to the bone marrow as a preparative regimen before transplant while causing fewer side effects than standard radiation therapy.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

These treatment protocols are highly gonadotoxic (i.e. they may cause later fertility problems) and therefore these patients have been proposed to store some testicular tissue during childhood as an option to preserve their fertility.

The main questions this study aims to answer are (1) the impact of the received gonadotoxic treatment on the later fertility status and (2) the additional impact of a testicular biopsy procedure (performed at a young age to harvest testicular tissue for storage) on the future fertility.

Participants will be asked to undergo a physical examination by a fertility specialist, to undergo a scrotal ultrasound, to give a blood sample, and to provide a semen sample.

3. To explore the value of musculoskeletal cross-modal imaging assessment system of ultrasound combined with abdominal CT/MRI in evaluating the long-term prognosis of patients with lung cancer.","Sarcopenia is a progressive and systemic skeletal muscle disease that involves accelerated loss of muscle mass and function and is associated with increased adverse outcomes in older adults such as falls, functional decline, weakness, and death. It can be comorbid with a variety of diseases and interacts extensively with various disease states to influence disease prognosis. According to literature reports, the prevalence of sarcopenia in lung cancer patients is 42.8%-45.0%, and many studies have confirmed that sarcopenia is associated with a variety of poor prognosis of lung cancer. Early identification of sarcopenia in lung cancer patients and early intervention before the surgery are very important steps to improve the prognosis of lung patients.

However, at present, the evaluation methods of sarcopenia are very complicated, which rely on three features: loss of muscle mass, loss of muscle strength, and loss of physical performance. At present, physicians usually use bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to determine skeletal muscle mass index SMI to measure muscle mass, grip strength test to measure muscle strength, gait speed or tools such as SPPB scores to assess physical performance. A diagnosis of sarcopenia can be made when a subject experiences a decrease in SMI combined with a decrease in grip strength or a decrease in gait speed. The above evaluation methods are difficult to be used as routine preoperative evaluation items.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SMI in older adults can be accurately estimated by using muscle thickness acquired from ultrasound examination with basic information such as age and body mass index (BMI). And it has been shown that the cross-sectional area of the psoas major muscle at L3-level assessed by CT/MRI can also preliminarily diagnose sarcopenia. However, existing alternatives for assessing sarcopenia with ultrasound or CT/MRI alone are incomplete and lack stability.

Fronted with such a dilemma, we attempted to establish a musculoskeletal cross-modal imaging evaluation system of ultrasound combined with abdominal CT/MRI images, which can diagnose sarcopenia more comprehensively and accurately, and evaluate the perioperative prognosis, nutritional support effect and long-term prognosis of patients.",RECRUITING,,2023-11-01,2028-11,2027-11,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,1500,ESTIMATED

Opioids are known to suppress immune function following both acute and chronic administration; however, they appear to be different according to the schedule of administration as well as the state of the organism. Programmed death-1 (PD-1, also known as CD279) belongs to the CD28 receptor superfamily. It is an inhibitory receptor, and its expression is upregulated on activated leukocytes, resulting in an inhibited immune response. PD-1 interacts with two ligands: programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also referred to as B7-H1) and programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2, also known as B7-DC). PD-L2 is expressed mainly on activated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, whereas PD-L1 is distributed widely. In addition to immune cells, some subsets of tumor cells also express PD-L1 to escape from immunosurveillance.

The aim of PAMELA is to test the hypothesis that PAM50 HER2-enriched (HER2-E) subtype better predicts response to neoadjuvant dual anti-HER2 blockade, with or without endocrine therapy, compared to traditional clinical HER2 classification. Furthermore, we posit that characterization of gene expression patterns may identify profiles of those who may be safely spared chemotherapy.","PAMELA is a non-randomized, open label, multicentric translational research study of neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade therapy without chemotherapy. Although efficacy and safety will be investigated, the primary goal is to identify profiles predictive of clinical benefit from targeted therapy. Eligible patients must be women with untreated primary HER2-overexpressing and/or amplified breast tumors of more than 1 cm in diameter amenable to definitive surgery (stage I-IIIA).

The PAMELA study is designed to test the hypothesis that the PAM50 HER2-E subtype is able to predict clinical response to neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade with lapatinib and trastuzumab, with or without endocrine therapy, assessed by pathological complete response in the breast (pCRB) rate at the time of surgery, compared to traditional clinical HER2 classification. Furthermore, we posit that characterization of gene expression patterns may identify profiles of those who may be safely spared chemotherapy.

Patients will first undergo screening, tumor measurement, and mandatory collection of core tumor biopsies for central determination of HER2 and HR status. These biopsies will be used to determine gene expression patterns once the patient is included in the study. Patients will be treated with dual HER2 blockade consisting of lapatinib and trastuzumab for a total of 18 weeks. Patients who are HR-positive will also be given endocrine therapy, letrozole or tamoxifen depending on their menopausal status, for the same 18 weeks. If tumor progression is observed by ultrasound (US) at week 6, tumors will be identified as resistant, and paclitaxel will be added to dual HER2 blockade, maintaining trastuzumab at the same original dose and reducing lapatinib dose for safety reasons. In those patients with HR-positive disease, endocrine therapy will be withdrawn in order to avoid its adverse interactions with chemotherapy.

Two weeks after the first administration of study medication, all patients will undergo mandatory repeat tumor tissue acquisition that will be used for secondary endpoint assessment.

Post treatment tissue acquisition will be obtained at the time of surgery from the specimen excised.

US of the breast and axillary lymph nodes will be performed at baseline, Day 14, week 6, and prior to surgery, and will be correlated with pCR. If tumor progression is observed on week 6, the US will be repeated on week 10 to discard the progression continues despite the addition of paclitaxel at neoadjuvant regimen.

Mammography is required at baseline and prior to surgery, but will not be used for the objective response assessment.

Treatment will be given until definitive surgery, clinical signs of disease progression after paclitaxel addition, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.

Breast surgery will be carried out 1 to 3 weeks after completion of dual HER2 blockade with or without endocrine therapy, and 2 to 3 weeks after completion of paclitaxel plus dual HER2 blockade, should it had been initiated for progressive disease.

With current treatment, event-free survival (EFS) rates vary between 75%\~85%. Two different MTX intensification strategies are used commonly: HD-MTX with leucovorin rescue, and Capizzi-style MTX without leucovorin rescue plus PEG-ASP (C-MTX). Although superior outcome of patients with T-ALL receiving C-MTX compared with HD-MTX on the AALL0434 trial, the 2 approaches had not been compared directly in patients with T-LBL. There remains controversy on PET/CT interpretation in children with NHL. Large prospective studies in pediatric patients with T-LBL regarding PET/CT value for this is scarce. Around 1% pediatric patients with T-LBL will not achieve remission at the end of Induction (induction failure). The optimal treatment for this small subgroup is largely unclear. The BFM HR Blocks usually are applied to these patients even though the efficacy is unknown. Novel targeted therapies are needed for use. Dasatinib is identified as a targeted therapy for T-cell ALL in preclinical drug screening.","1. T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) which involves 90% of LBL cases is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children and adolescents. With current treatment, event-free survival (EFS) rates vary between 75%\~85%. Poor probabilities of survival (10\~15%) for patients after relapse leave no room for treatment de-escalation in frontline protocols. Limitations in numbers of newly diagnosed patients impeded evaluation potential prognostic markers and validation or conducting clinical studies.
2. In the GER-GPOH-NHL-BFM-95 study, the prophylactic cranial radiation was omitted, and the intensity of induction therapy was decreased slightly. There were no significant increases in CNS relapses, suggesting cranial radiation may be reserved for patients with CNS disease at diagnosis. The 5-year EFS was worse in NHL-BFM-95 (82%) than in NHL-BFM-90 (90%). It was proposed that the major difference in EFS between NHL-BFM-90 and NHL-BFM-95 resulted from the increased number of subsequent neoplasms observed in NHL-BFM-95.
3. Two different MTX intensification strategies are used commonly: HD-MTX with leucovorin rescue, and Capizzi-style MTX without leucovorin rescue plus PEG-ASP (C-MTX). Although superior outcome of patients with T-ALL receiving C-MTX compared with HD-MTX on the AALL0434 trial, the 2 approaches had not been compared directly in patients with T-LBL.
4. POG 9404: the small cohort (n = 66) of lymphoma patients who did not receive HD-MTX, the 5-year EFS was 88%. Of note, all of these patients received prophylactic cranial radiation therapy, which has been demonstrated not to be required in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) patients.
5. COG-A5971 evaluated 2 strategies for CNS prophylaxis without CNS irradiation \[5\]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive HD-MTX in interim maintenance (BFM-95) or intrathecal chemotherapy throughout maintenance (CCG-BFM). The overall incidence of CNS relapse was 1.2%, and there was no difference between the treatment arms for CNS relapse, DFS, or OS. Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) \>1% by FLOW at diagnosis was shown to be associated with a worse outcome in this trial (a BFM backbone containing HD-MTX). Measurement of bone marrow MDD at diagnosis with sequential response monitoring through peripheral blood during remission induction to aid treatment stratification was also suggested in an early COG study. The prognostic significance of MDD at End-of-Induction (EOI) or End-of-Consolidation (EOC) for T-LBL patients with positive MDD at diagnosis is still unclear.
6. COG AALL0434: the COG ABFM regimen with C-MTX provided excellent DFS without cranial radiation for patients with standard risk T-LBL (85%, Arm A, n=82, completed 64) and high risk T-LBL (85%, Arm A, n=61, completed 51) although patients with CNS 3 were not included. It appears that C-MTX may have negated the prognostic impact of MDD.
7. Nelarabine is unavailable in mainland China at this time, which did not show benefit in COG AALL0434 study.
8. AALL07P1: 10 patients with T-LBL in first relapse treated with a 4-drug induction regimen adding bortezomib: 7 had a response (1 had a complete response, 2 had unconfirmed complete responses, and 4 had partial responses)
9. COG AALL1231 for T-LBL: the 4-year EFS and OS were better in bortezomib group than the control group (86.4% and 89.5% vs. 76.5% and 78.3%, p=0.041 and 0.009, respectively.). Incorporating bortezomib into standard therapy for de novo T-LBL appears beneficial.
10. A biopsy for pathological examination of a mediastinal residual mass is a clinical dilemma. Currently, conventional imaging is still considered as the ""standard"" modality for evaluating pediatric patients with NHL at diagnosis and subsequent response. There remains controversy on PET/CT interpretation in children with NHL. Large prospective studies in pediatric patients with T-LBL regarding PET/CT value for this is scarce.
11. Although an overlap in morphology and immune-phenotyping exists in T-LBL and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), different disease distribution suggests possible different genetic profiles and pathogenesis. Except for stage, none of other parameters is used in the current stratification system outside of clinical trials for T-LBL (several candidates, but none have been validated sufficiently). Little is known about biomarkers with prognostic relevance for T-LBL. To improve risk stratification strategy and better understand biologic rationale for incorporating novel therapies (chemicals, target agents and immunotherapy) into a conventional chemotherapy backbone, translational research to identify molecular markers with prognostic relevance in T-LBL is highly recommended.
12. With the current treatment, around 1% pediatric patients with T-LBL will not achieve remission at the end of Induction (induction failure). The optimal treatment for this small subgroup is largely unclear. The BFM HR Blocks usually are applied to these patients even though the efficacy is unknown.

Incidence of treatment discontinuations due to AEs and SAEs will be summarised overall and by dose. -Safety Lab parameters and vital signs at pre-treatment and post-treatment and corresponding changes from pre-treatment will be presented by dose as descriptive statistics. Efficacy analysis will be performed on efficacy population. Dyspnoea will be scored from screening to D30. Dyspnoea score will be presented at pre- and post-treatment and change from pre- to post-treatment will be presented as descriptive statistics by dose. The pleural infusion index will be determined by comparing chest X-rays before treatment (D0) and post-treatment at D1, D10 and 30 days and pleurodesis or indwelling catheter placement. The index will be presented at pre- and post-treatment and change from pre- to post-treatment will be presented as descriptive statistics by dose. Exploratory endpoints: exploratory analyses will be performed by tissue immunostaining and image analysis will be carried out. The concentration of cisplatin in tumor tissue at the beginning and end of mild hyperthermia PITHAC will be evaluated by Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) that will allow visualization of cisplatin distribution and penetration in tumor biopsies. The correlation between cisplatin concentration and penetration into tumor tissue and clinical response will be explored. Immune infiltration in tumor tissues will be assessed by immunostainings and image analysis will be performed. Immune cells proportions in peripheral blood before and after PITHAC at D0, 10 and 30 will be explored using DURAClone Panels for flow cytometry.

PART B: Expansion: Determination of Sample Size: the sample in the expansion phase is not based on a formal hypothesis.

The data collected through RedCap® will be automatically checked by the implementation of data validation rules (e.g., data-type, maximum/minimum range, missing data checks, and other logical tests) and automatic alerts. Specification of source documents: study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial. The Investigator must keep a subject file (medical file, original medical records) electronically (SOARIAN/ARCHIMEDE) for every subject included in the trial. All documents containing source data must be filed in the electronic patient file. Electronic subject files (SOARIAN/ARCHIMEDE) will be accessible to the Monitor to perform source data verification. Record keeping / archiving: the SI will retain copies of the patient trial records (CRFs, patient informed consent statement, drug inventory logs and all other information collected during the trial) and documentation until at least 10 years after the termination of the trial.It must be available for review by the Monitor and must be ready for Sponsor audit as well as for inspection by Competent Authorities during and after the trial and must be safely archived for at least 10 years (or per local requirements or as otherwise notified by the Sponsor) after the end of the trial. The documents to be thus archived include the Subject Identification List and the signed subject ICFs.

Safety Monitoring (Dose Escalation Part): a Trial Safety Board (TSB) will be constituted for the part A of the trial, being responsible for maintaining the scientific integrity of the trial and safety of patients. This Board will review the DLTs of each cohort and decide whether to escalate or not to the next dose level (next cohort). Details on the dose escalation design, rules, and the role of the TSB are provided in the DEP. The TSB will give the green light to start part B after recommended dose confirmation, based on safety and efficacy data of all patients enrolled in part A. For Part B, the responsibility for the safety of the individual patient lies with the investigator and the SI.

NCT05549960,Pre-planning Mathematical Models in EUS-guided Laser Ablation of Pancreatic Lesions,Use of Pre-planning Models for the Guidance of the Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Laser Ablation of Pancreatic Lesions,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth cause of cancer death in Western countries. More than 50% of the patients with PDAC has a local advanced or metastatic disease at the time of the diagnosis. There is a growing interest in the investigation of novel and alternative therapeutic strategies which could be used in synergy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. These methods include echoendoscopic (EUS) guided locoregional ablation to reduce the tumoral mass.

The most studied technique is the radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Another interesting technique involves the use of the laser source at a wavelength of 1064 nm. Among all the ablative methods, LA is the only one that allows the use of a thinner needle. These features make LA a suitable option for treating focal lesions in high-risk areas or in hard-to-reach locations. A previous study demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in pancreatic solid lesions.

In order to perform a study aimed at the complete treatment of the lesion, it is necessary to identify the laser parameters which are specific to the size and location of the lesion.

The present protocol presents a prospective interventional study aimed at the analysis and applicability of predictive mathematical models for the calculation of laser settings in the ablation of pancreatic lesion by means of a EUS-guided LA.","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth cause of cancer death in Western countries, with an estimation of 57,600 new cases and 47,050 deaths in 2020 in USA.

Since the number of deaths due to this lethal disease is rapidly increasing, it is estimated to become the second leading cause of tumor-related death by 2030.

The high mortality rate of PDAC is due to several causes, including: i) a poor early diagnosis, ii) the severe biological aggressiveness, and iii) the lack of response to the systemic therapies.

At present, surgical resection, i.e., pancreatectomy, represents the only widely accepted treatment option with the potential to increase long-term survival. However, only 20% of the patients are appropriate surgical candidates at the time of the diagnosis. In the majority of the patients, the disease is at an advanced or metastatic stadium, and the surgical resection does not represent a possible option. In these last cases, only palliative solutions are available.

Nowadays there is a growing interest in the investigation of novel and alternative therapeutic strategies which could be used in synergy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. These methods include the inoculation o antitumoral agents within the lesion, through laparoscopic, percutaneous or echoendoscopic (EUS) guidance and locoregional ablation to reduce the tumoral mass.

This solution may be particularly beneficial for those patients who are stable after the chemotherapy, without any signs of disease regression neither progression. The ablation can be obtained with different kinds of energy sources, including radiofrequency, microwave and laser.

The first study of EUS-guided LA on human patients was conducted by Di Matteo and collaborators who recently performed a prospective study on the feasibility of EUS-guided LA in cases of inoperable and locally advanced PDAC. A total of 9 patients with stage III pancreatic cancer were screened and underwent EUS-guided LA. The fiber was placed in the upper part of the lesion and the following laser power parameters were applied: 2 W for 800 J, 1000 J, or 1200 J; 3 W for 800 J, 1000 J, or 1200 J; 4 W for 800 J, 1000 J, or 1200 J. The application time automatically ranges between 200 and 600 s, according to the power values. No difficulty was experienced in the technical execution of the procedure. The fiber was clearly visible within the targeted lesion, for the entire duration of the application of laser energy. During the procedure, the tip of the fiber was progressively surrounded by a hyperechoic area. This effect did not compromise the endosonographic visualization of the needle inside the lesion. At the end of the ablation, the EUS highlighted a hyperechoic area along the path of the probe, surrounded by non-homogeneous tissue with hyperechoic areas. No relevant complications were found. Control CT scans after 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days showed well-defined coagulative necrotic areas. The average ablation volumes obtained at 800 J decreased by 85% (1.18 cm3 after 24 hours against 0.17 cm3 after 30 days). The average ablation volumes obtained at 1000 J decreased by 76% (3.16 cm3 after 24 hours against 0.80 cm3 after 30 days). Finally, the mean ablation volumes at 1200 J decreased by 44% after 30 days from treatment (1.77 cm3 after 24 hours against 0.98 cm3 after 30 days). According to these results, the 4 W / 1000 J power configuration achieved the largest ablation volume, without clinical complications.

In order to perform a study aimed at the complete treatment of the lesion, it is necessary to identify the laser parameters which are specific to the size and location of the lesion. As identified in a recent study by Paiella, the choice of settings and handling of the laser device requires a certain learning curve. Therefore, a predictive mathematical model of the setting parameters can be very beneficial to simplify the ablative procedure. Furthermore, in the absence of correct parameters, several potential complications can occur, such as acute pancreatitis, bleeding from adjacent vascular structures, duodenal perforation or lesion of the biliary tract.

The effectiveness of predictive models for LA has already been demonstrated in some ex vivo and preclinical studies, both on the pancreas and on other tissues.

Considering all the aspects above, the present protocol presents a prospective interventional study aimed at the analysis and applicability of predictive mathematical models for the calculation of laser settings in the ablation of pancreatic lesion by means of a EUS-guided LA.

The investigators will use a mathematical model for the calculation of the laser parameters (power, treatment time), taking into account the size of the tumor and some anatomical characteristics, such as the proximity of blood vessels. The aims of this study fall within the objectives of the European project LASER OPTIMAL (Laser Ablation: Selectivity and Monitoring for Optimal Tumor Removal, GA 759159, http://www.laseroptimal.polimi.it/) of which Professor Saccomandi is Principal Investigator and Dr. Di Matteo is an expert for clinical procedures.

This is a prospective interventional study involving two Italian centers, the Operative Digestive Endoscopy UOC of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico (the ""Coordinating Center"") and the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Politecnico di Milano.

This is a non-controlled, non-randomized interventional feasibility study with a non-commercial purpose.

The Operative Digestive Endoscopy UOC of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico will be responsible for enrolling patients and performing the medical procedures. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of Politecnico di Milano will work on the laser parameters estimation using a mathematical model. Pre-operative radiological images of the candidates will be used for the purpose.

Patients with stage III and IV PDAC; non-functioning or functioning neuroendocrine tumors; pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma will be evaluated and included in the study if eligible.

All patients will be followed at the Coordinating Center from enrollment to death or the end of the study.

Description of study procedures:

1. Preoperative radiological image acquisition.

   MR images collected within 7 days before the LA EUS-guided procedure will be used by the study collaborators to reconstruct the patient's model. The tumor size and some anatomical features, such as the proximity of blood vessels, will be used in the patient's model. Techniques of image segmentation, 3D geometry reconstruction, and mathematical simulation of laser-tissue interaction will be used to estimate the optimal parameters for the laser (power, energy, time), according to the procedure described by Scott et al. Specifically, Mimics Innovation Suite software will be used to obtain the 3D geometry of the anatomical part of interest (pancreas, tumor, surrounding structures). This will then be imported into finite element computational software (Comsol Multiphysics) allowing the correct and patient-specific settings to be calculated.
2. Estimation of laser parameter settings with the mathematical model

   The mathematical model is based on finite element simulations implemented using the commercial Comsol Multiphysics software, as previously proposed by Scott et al. Laser settings will be based on values calculated in the Di Matteo and coworkers's experimentation, as previously performed by Saccomandi et al. on ex vivo models. This part of the study will be carried out in collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Politecnico di Milano as part of the European LASEROPTIMAL project (www.laseroptimal.polimi.it), coordinated by Paola Saccomandi, and for which Dr. Di Matteo is an external expert.
3. LA EUS-guided

EUS will be performed with a FUJIFILM EG- 580UT linear endoscope. Procedures will be performed on the patient under deep sedation, positioned on the left flank.

Prophylactic antibiotics will be administered immediately before the procedure and for the following 3 days (ceftriaxone 1 g twice daily intravenously). LA will be performed with a 980 nm laser light (EUFOTON Laser Spectrum) guided by a 300 μm optical fiber (EUFOTON). An 22 Gauge needle (Boston Scientific Expect Slimline) will be used for the optical fiber placement.

The protrusion of the fiber end from the needle tip should be 5 mm. After the correct placement of the fiber inside the tumor, the ablation treatment can start. Once inside the lesion, the needle will be slightly retracted, and the fiber will be gently pushed out of the needle tip by a length of 5 mm. The fiber will be placed at the top of the lesion, and the laser will be turned on. The laser settings estimated by the mathematical model will be used. The total number of ablations will depend on the radiological characteristics of the lesion and location. Special attention must be paid to have 1 cm between the fiber tip, the walls of the main vessels, and any metal stents that may be present.",UNKNOWN,,2023-02-01,2023-12-01,2023-11-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,10,ESTIMATED

Some cytostatics and their metabolites can also induce diarrhea directly due to effect on the intestinal mucosa.

Use of probiotics in prevention and treatment of diarrhea relies on both the theoretical assumptions and the results of several clinical trials. Lactic acid bacteria involved in the treatment of dysbiosis, compete for substrate with pathogenic bacteria, produce bacterio-cins, increase transepithelial resistance. Their enzymatic activity affects activation or deactivation of metabolites which cause diarrhea. Production of short chain fatty acids, which are important for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal cells also contributes to their antidiarrhoeal effect.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial was designed to evaluate potential of probiotics to prevent grade 3-4 diarrhea in patients treated by irinotecan based chemotherapy during first 6 weeks of irinotecan based chemotherapy","In preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea in double blind placebo controlled clinical trials it was found protective effect of probiotics containing S. boulardii and Enterococcus faecium. Also in preventing infectious diseases associated with Clostridium difficile, administration of probiotics resulted in a significant decrease in disease recurrence. Duration of rotavirus diarrhea, in children and in immunocompromised HIV-positive patients was significantly shortened after administration of strains of Lactobacilli and S. boulardii respectively.

Meta-analysis of 9 randomized, placebo-controlled trials showed significant reduction in the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhea in children. Another meta-analysis in which 23 studies were included showed significant reduction in risk of infectious diarrhea. Most of these studies was carried out with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG®.

The incidence of diarrhea during treatment of acute leukemia is between 15 to 80%. Severe diarrhea level 3 to 4 is present in 8-20% and is much more common during the induction phase of chemotherapy. In phase II study performed in NCI Slovakia preventive administration of Enterococcus faecium probiotic strain M-74 with selenium was associated with low incidence (14%) and severity (all grade 1) diarrhea, despite the fact that half of the patients received induction therapy. The investigators noted safety of probiotic strain during 370 days of severe neutropenia Gr 3-4.

The incidence of irinotecan induced diarrhea varies between 60-90%, by which the incidence of severe diarrhea is 20-40%. In phase II studies, its incidence was 17% in NCI Slovakia, but irinotecan dose was reduced by 25% in all patients. Diarrhea is an important factor in morbidity and mortality during irinotecan based chemotherapy. Predisposing factors are age over 65 years, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) PS (Performance status) of 1 and previous abdominopelvic radiation. One of irinotecan metabolites, SN-38 (7-ethyl-10 hydroxycamptothecin), which is glucuronidated in the liver and subsequently expelled into intestine is main cause of diarrhea. Due to the bacterial enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase it is deconjugated in intestinal lumen again. This form causes direct damage to intestinal mucosa associated with malabsorption of water, electrolytes and development of diarrhea.

Reduction of activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase using broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or beta-D-glucuronidase inhibitors is one of the ways to avoid irinotecan induced diarrhea. It is also possible to modulate metabolism of irinotecan using cyclosporine and phenobarbital to reduce biliary excretion of SN-38 and induction of glucuronidation. Promising results were shown using activated charcoal, which has resulted in the absorption of SN-38. Also other methods were tested: oral alkalization, thalidomide, amifostine, but without success. These procedures have been studied only in phase II trials. It is known that some probiotic bacteria, reduce activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase and therefore these bacteria could be applied in the prevention of diarrhea in patients treated by irinotecan based therapy.

Results of phase III study, that was prematurely terminated due to poor accrual showed benefit of Colon Dophilus on irinotecan induced gastrointestinal toxicity. In this trial, 46 patients with colorectal cancer starting a new line of irinotecan based therapy were enrolled. 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine along with irinotecan was administered to 26 (56.5%) patients and 22 (47.8%) patients received biological therapy as well. Patients were randomized 1:1 to probiotic (PRO) or placebo arm (PLA). Probiotic formula Colon Dophilus, was administered at a dose of 10x109 CFU (colony forming unit) of bacteria tid, orally for 12 weeks of chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea. 23 patients were randomized to PRO and 23 patients to PLA. Administration of probiotics compared to placebo led to a reduction in the incidence of severe diarrhea of grade 3 or 4 (0% for PRO vs. 17.4% for PLA, p = 0.11), as well as reduction of the overall incidence of diarrhea (39.1% for PRO vs. 60.9% for PLA, p = 0.24) and incidence of enterocolitis (0% for PRO vs. 8.7% for PLA). Patients on PRO used less loperamide compared to PLA (mean duration of loperamide use: 4.5 days for PRO vs. 10.4 days for PLA, p = 0.45; mean number of loperamide tablets: 5.9 for PRO vs. 37.7 for PLA, p = 0.49). There was no infection caused by probiotic strains recorded.

Two recent studies in murine model showed, that bacteria in the gut enhance the body's immune response to cancer, mobilizing immune cells to kill cancer cells, not just in the gut but throughout the body as well. The researchers also found that the bacteria affect the efficacy of three different cancer treatments.

Given their low toxicity, good tolerability, probiotics may be an important part of supportive therapy and moreover they can enhance efficacy of anticancer therapy. The objective of this phase III. trial is to determine effectiveness of the probiotic formula Probio-Tec® BG-VCap-6.5 in the prophylaxis of irinotecan induced diarrhea due to reduction intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase activity and further biochemical and physiological actions of specific strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12® and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG®, LGG® that are active substances of used food supplement - PROBIO-FIX INUM®. Both of strains are well-documented. LGG® has been studied in more over 800 scientific publications. Studies have found that LGG® supports immunity, enhances antibody formation during viral infection, and decreases incidence of gastrointestinal infections, antibiotic associated diarrhoea, and respiratory infections. In addition to its well-researched health benefits, the safety of LGG® has been more widely studied than any other probiotic bacterium. It has a safe history of use in foods and is extensively documented in more over 200 clinical studies.

The large number of clinical studies and scientific publications indicate that the BB-12® probiotic strain - alone or in combination with other of probiotic strains (e.g. LGG®) - may have beneficial effects regarding the gastrointestinal and immune areas. BB-12® is considered to be best studied probiotic bifidobacteria, described in more than 360 scientific studies.",COMPLETED,,2016-03,2022-11,2022-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,PREVENTION,233,ACTUAL

NCT03395860,Low Dose ATG Plus Low Dose PTCy as GVHD Prophylaxis in Haplo-HSCT,Low Dose Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin Plus Low-dose Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide as GVHD in Hapl-HSCT for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies: a Phase II Trial,Low dose Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin plus Low-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with hematologic malignancies,"A novel regimen, which is composed of a low dose of ATG (5 mg/kg) and low-dose PTCy (one dose of PTCy, 50mg/kg) for GVHD prophylaxis in haplo-HSCT for patients with hematologic malignancies, is going to be evaluated in the prospective, randomized control, phase II clinical trial. It is theoretically feasible because the mechanisms of ATG and Cyclophosphamide on T lymphocyte are different. ATG plays the immunosuppressive activity on the depletion of peripheral T lymphocytes through complement dependent lysis or activation-associated apoptosis. ATG also modulates cell-surface expression of surface adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors. In addition, ATG can also affect or interfere with the function of different immune cells such as B lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg), natural killer (NK)-T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC).Cyclophosphamide is nontoxic to hematopoietic stem cells and can selectively deplete the alloreactive T cells. Therefore, we hypothesis that ATG followed by PTCy have the synergistic effect on GVHD prophylaxis. (2) Luznik et al also showed that there was no difference in the incidence of severe acute GVHD between one or two doses of PTCy. Furthermore, there was a trend toward a lower incidence of extensive cGVHD among patients of two doses of PTCy compared with one dose PTCy. One dose of PTCy might preserve the GVL effect without influencing the incidence of the severe aGVHD. (3) Y Wang et al reported a randomized clinical trial comparing two different doses of ATG (6 and 10mg/kg) as GVHD prophylaxis for Haplo-HSCT. There was no difference in the median myeloid and platelet engraftment time and the rate of graft failure. The results showed that the incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD was higher in the ATG-6 group than in the ATG-10 group. But the EBV reactivation occurred more frequently in the ATG-10 group than in the ATG-6 group. The higher rate of infection and NRM may influence the transplant outcomes in this GVHD prophylaxis strategy. We speculated that low dose of ATG (5 mg/kg) will ensure the engraftment and decrease infection frequency. But the optimal timing of ATG administration still needed to be considered. The immunosuppressive activity of ATG is not only dose-dependent but also rely on the timing of drug administration, especially when the lower dose of ATG was used as GVHD Prophylaxis. So we designed a randomized control phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity with low dose ATG followed by low dose PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis .",UNKNOWN,,2017-05-30,2021-12-20,2020-05-20,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,100,ESTIMATED

NCT05198960,AVAJAK: Apixaban/Rivaroxaban Versus Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Thrombo-embolic Complications in JAK2V617F-positive Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,AVAJAK: Apixaban/Rivaroxaban Versus Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Thrombo-embolic Complications in JAK2V617F-positive Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,"Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are frequent and chronic myeloid malignancies including Polycythemia Vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) and Prefibrotic myelofibrosis (PreMF). These MPNs are caused by the acquisition of mutations affecting activation/proliferation pathways in hematopoietic stem cells. The principal mutations are JAK2V617F, calreticulin (CALR exon 9) and MPL W515. ET or MFP/PreMF patients who do not carry one of these three mutations are declared as triple-negative (3NEG) cases even if they are real MPN cases.

These diseases are at high risk of thrombo-embolic complications and with high morbidity/mortality. This risk varies from 4 to 30% depending on MPN subtype and mutational status.

In terms of therapy, all patients with MPNs should also take daily low-dose aspirin (LDA) as first antithrombotic drug, which is particularly efficient to reduce arterial but not venous events.

Despite the association of a cytoreductive drug and LDA, thromboses still occur in 5-8% patients/year.

All these situations have been explored in biological or clinical assays. All of them could increase the bleeding risk. We should look at different ways to reduce the thrombotic incidence: Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC)? In the general population, in medical or surgical contexts, DOACs have demonstrated their efficiency to prevent or cure most of the venous or arterial thrombotic events.

At the present time, DOAC can be used in cancer populations according to International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommendations, except in patients with cancer at high bleeding risk (gastro-intestinal or genito-urinary cancers). Unfortunately, in trials evaluating DOAC in cancer patients, most patients have solid rather than hematologic cancers (generally less than 10% of the patients, mostly lymphoma or myeloma).

In cancer patients, DOAC are also highly efficient to reduce the incidence of thrombosis (-30 to 60%), but patients are exposed to a higher hemorrhagic risk, especially in digestive cancer patients.

In the cancer population, pathophysiology of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events may be quite different between solid cancers and MPN. If MPN patients are also considered to be cancer patients in many countries, the pathophysiology of thrombosis is quite specific (hyperviscosity, platelet abnormalities, clonality, specific cytokines...) and they are exposed to a lower risk of digestive hemorrhages. It is thus difficult to extend findings from the ""general cancer population"" to MPN patients.

Unfortunately, only scarce, retrospective data regarding the use of DOAC in MPNs are available data.

We were the first to publish a ""real-life"" study about the use, the impact, and the risks in this population. In this local retrospective study, 25 patients with MPN were treated with DOAC for a median time of 2.1 years. We observed only one thrombosis (4%) and three major hemorrhages (12%, after trauma or unprepared surgery). Furthermore, we have compared the benefit/risk balance compared to patients treated with LDA without difference.

With the increasing evidences of efficacy and tolerance of DOAC in large cohorts of patients including cancer patients, with their proven efficacy on prevention of both arterial and venous thrombotic events and because of the absence of prospective trial using these drugs in MPN patients, we propose to study their potential benefit as primary thrombotic prevention in MPN.",,RECRUITING,,2022-07-13,2027-07-13,2027-07-13,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,1308,ESTIMATED

NCT01404260,Intercalating and Maintenance Use of Iressa Versus Chemotherapy in Selected Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,Intercalating and Maintenance Use of Iressa vs. Chemotherapy in Selected Advanced NSCLC: a Randomised Study,"Platinum-based combination chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine-carboplatin, is one of the standard first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) have clinical efficacy, as compared with the best supportive care or standard chemotherapy, when given as second-line or third-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.

Treatment with EGFR-TKI is most effective in female, never-smoker, or patients with adenocarcinoma, and patients of Asian origin. In these populations, such treatment is associated with favorable objective response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival. These populations also have a relatively high incidence of somatic mutations in the region of the EGFR gene that encodes the tyrosine kinase domain.

The recent study(IPASS) by Tony S. Mok showed gefitinib was superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia . In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the EGFR gene mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel(HR= 0.48,P\<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel(HR=2.85,P\<0.001). Gefitinib treatment was well tolerated, with lower in hematologic toxicity, and no treatment-related interstitial lung disease.In this study(IPASS), only patients with a mutation of the EGFR gene in the tumor could get benefit from gefitinib as first line treatment.

Tony S. Mok and his colleague also found that intercalating and maintenance administration of erlotinib(another EGFR-TKI)following gemcitabine/platinum chemotherapy as first line therapy led to a significant improvement in PFS .","Nowadays,EGFR mutation status is unknown for most of the advanced NSCLC patients in clinical practice.Those patients with high probability of EGFR mutation maybe could get benefit from gefitinib as first-line treatment. For this reason, the investigators need more investigation to focus on EGFR mutation unknown patients. In the previous study (including FAST-ACT), the patients enrolled trial received EGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy nearly simultaneously,so the investigators could not know whether those patients gained benefit from EGFR-TKI or chemotherapy, maybe chemotherapy alone was enough. If the patients with EGFR mutation status unknown could get stable disease(SD) after two cycles of chemotherapy,those patients may be optimal for the investigation of intercalating and maintenance administration of gefitinib. The reasons are that chemotherapy may be enough for those with objective response after two cycles chemotherapy, of course, those with disease progression (PD) should be excluded from the study.

On the basis of these and other studies, the investigators hypothesized that in a selected population,first-line chemotherapy(gemcitabine +carboplatin) with intercalating and maintenance use of gefitinib would be more efficacious than chemotherapy alone. In this study, the investigators compared the efficacy, safety, and adverse-event profile of chemotherapy plus gefitinib with those of chemotherapy alone, when these drugs were used as first-line treatment in nonsmokers or former light smokers in China, who had lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR gene mutation unknown.",COMPLETED,,2011-06,2015-10,2015-03,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,219,ACTUAL

The study will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation phase (Part A) and expansion phase (Part B).","Part A:

In this phase, dose escalation will start from 200 mg and the present 2 dose cohorts are 200 mg BID and 250 mg BID. Up to 12 subjects are expected to be enrolled in this part. In each cohort, all subjects will receive a single oral dose of IPG1094, followed by a 3-day single-dose PK study period.

The DLT evaluation period includes the single-dose PK study period and the first cycle of treatment (within 31 days after the first dose). The remaining subjects within the same cohort will be dosed if no significant safety signals are identified in the first subject in 3 days.

Starting at 200 mg cohort, 3 subjects will be enrolled initially at each subsequent dose cohort in accordance with the 3+3 dose-escalation design. After 3 subjects in each cohort completed DLT evaluation, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review all available safety and PK/PD data from all treated subjects (DLT evaluable and non-DLT evaluable subjects), taking into consideration the dose-assignment recommendation based on 3+3 decision rule (as described in the table below), to make the recommendation on the conduct of the study including the dose level and dose schedule for subsequent subjects.

Part B:

After all subjects in Part A completed DLT evaluations, the SMC will review all available safety, PK/PD and efficacy data from all treated subjects, to recommend 1 dose level for Part B. Phase B is an expansion study to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of IPG1094 in patients with several types of solid tumors, including but not limited to small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and melanoma (specific tumor types will depend on the results of Part A), with 12 subjects in each cohort.

Background: Treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has proven efficacy in two large randomized trials (MM-009 and MM-010) leading to a time to progression (TTP) of 17.1 months for patients with only one prior therapy and a TTP of 10.6 months for 2 and more prior therapies, respectively \[1-3\]. Continuous treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone until disease progression is therefore considered a standard therapy for second line treatment in multiple myeloma patients. However, only a relatively low rate of high quality response (CR, complete response and VGPR, very good partial response) is achieved. High quality responses are associated with with improved progression-free survival and overall survival \[4\].

Trial: The aim of this trial is to improve high quality response rates for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the 2nd line treatment. This aim shall be achieved by the addition a third anti-myeloma drug (bendamustine) to the established backbone of lenalidomide/ dexamethasone.

Treatment regimen:

* Induction Treatment Phase: Cycles 1-6 Bendamustine 75mg/m2/d day 1 and 2, lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21, dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg (for patients \> 75years) d 1, 8, 15, 22.
* Maintenance Treatment Phase: Cycles 7-18 lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21, dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg (for patients \> 75 years) d 1, 8, 15, 22.

Due to hematoxicity of bendamustine and lenalidomide, administration of pegfilgrastim is mandatory in the induction treatment phase (BRd-regimen)for all patients experiencing severe neutropenia.

The aim of this study is to achieve high quality response rates (CR, VGPR) of ≥ 40%. If this aim is achieved, the treatment of bendamustine in combination with the established lenalidomide/ dexamethasone regimen will be considered promising.

Besides efficacy, the safety of this three-drug regimen is evaluated in this trial.","Assessments for efficacy / response evaluation:

The liver is supplied by two vessels, the hepatic artery and the portal vein supplying 25% and 75% respectively of the total blood flow with 50% oxygen from each vessel. During liver resection it is standard practice to clamp both vessels(Pringle's manoeuvre), so as to avoid bleeding. Clamping both the vessels deprives the unaffected liver from nutrients required for survival. Reinstating the blood supply causes further damage by pouring harmful substances into the liver, which accumulate during the clamping. We hypothesize that not clamping the oxygen rich hepatic artery will cause less damage to the liver.

Our aim is to compare the Pringle manoeuvre with portal vein clamping, to identify if the latter will result in less tissue injury and thereby fewer complications. Initially we aim to conduct a pilot study. The main objective is to ensure that patients can be successfully recruited and that data capture is complete. The secondary outcomes will be development of infective complications by 30 days following surgery, bleeding and blood transfusion requirements, heart/chest complications, recovery of liver functions, growth of remnant liver, death within 30 days following surgery, length of high dependency unit/hospital stay and quality of life at 3 months after surgery.

There is published literature on the safety of this method and in the event of any intraoperative problems, the procedure will be converted to the standard Pringle manoeuvre.

NCT04328194,Autotaxin (ATX) as a Marker for Breast Cancer,Autotaxin (ATX) as a Marker for Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. According to the GLOBOCAN 2018 worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality, in 2018, about 2,088,849 new cases were diagnosed and approximately 626,679 women were predicted to die from the disease . It is the leading cause of cancer related mortality, representing15% of deaths per year worldwide .","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females in Egypt. It accounts for 32 % of cancer in women . Breast cancer in Egypt carries an unfavorable prognosis with 29% mortality and 3.7:1 incidence to mortality ratio .

Despite the rising incidence of breast cancer, the survival rates have improved in recent years due to the deep research in biological behavior of breast cancer . Although the current 5-year survival for primary breast cancer is relatively high (ranging from 80% to 92% in different populations) survival rates decrease to less than 25% when the disease becomes metastatic .These data support the need to develop more efficient strategies for preventive, intervention, evaluation of therapy, and prediction of prognosis .

Autotaxin (ATX) is a glycoprotein encoded by the ENPP2 (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 2) gene located on chromosome 8. Identical to lysophospholipase D, ATX plays a role in the synthesis of the bioactive lipid mediator lysophosphatidate (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) .

LPA acts through specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to promote cellular proliferation, migration, and survival . ATX expression was also reported higher in poorly differentiated tumors and, in independent studies, is correlated with invasiveness of cancer cells suggesting a higher metastatic potential of ATX-expressing tumors . ATX is generated from platelets, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and adipocytes and specifically, ATX from adipocytes has an impact on plasma LPA level . Thus, adipocytes could be an important origin of ATX in tumors. Breast cancer is a human cancer that has adipocyte-rich stroma. Adipose tissue comprises 56% of non-lactating breast tissue, and 35% of lactating breast tissue . ATX-LPA signaling has been reported to be involved in angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and migration in breast cancer .

Increased ATX expression has also been reported in various forms of cancer, such as glioblastoma, hepatocellular and thyroid carcinomas, pancreatic and hematological cancers. A large number of evidence indicate that ATX-LPA is associated with chemotherapy resistance of cancer, and in breast cancer, ATX can reverse cell apoptosis.

In a mouse model, α-bromomethylene phosphonate LPA (BrP-LPA), a dual ATX and pan-LPAR( Lysophosphatidic acid receptor ) inhibitor, inhibited migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines and suppressed primary tumor and angiogenesis in a mouse xenograft study .

NCT06523894,Ablative SBRT in Elderly BC Patients,EASE (brEAst Stereo Elderly): A Phase Ia/Ib Study of Stereotactic Ablative Irradiation as an Alternative to Surgery in Elderly and Comorbid Breast Cancer Subjects,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a modern radiotherapy technique, through which extremely high doses of irradiation are delivered in a very precise manner, within a few fractions. SBRT is increasingly used into clinical practice because it can provide excellent local control, comparable to surgery, in many tumor locations, such as lung, liver or bone. Efforts to develop it for BC treatment are promising, as it is safe, convenient, and effective. To date, SBRT for BC has been developed as an alternative method of partial-breast irradiation (PBI) in the pre- or post-operative setting. Therefore, the doses tested are comparable to the conventional doses used with surgery although its potential as sole local treatment for BC remains unknown. Higher SBRT doses are expected to permit obtaining an ablative effect on tumor and be suitable as an alternative to surgery, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested.

The aim of the present study is to prove the feasibility of SBRT as an ablative treatment in early breast cancer (BC). The primary objective is to find the maximum tolerated dose of SBRT that can be safely administered in inoperable patients with BC, the majority of whom are elderly or oldest old.

The overall objective is to determine whether high precision, dose- and fractionation- adapted SBRT is feasible and safe in inoperable patients with BC. The dose and fractionation-adapted SBRT regimen permits to test feasibility in different tumor sizes.

The primary objective of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be delivered with a single or few (up to 5) fractions of SBRT in inoperable patients with BC.","SBRT will be performed using appropriate LINACs (Truebeam®, Varian, Palo Alto, US or Cyberknife®, Accuray, Morges, Switzerland) with a volumetric arc technique (VMAT), or non-coplanal technique, depending on the treating device. The medical devices have a CE certification and will be used in the trial as stated in the CE-marked instructions for use.

The gross tumor volume (GTV), as visualized on computed tomography (CT) within clips/fiducials, when present, with a 1mm (Cyberknife®)- 3mm (TrueBeam®) isotropic margin will be treated with an adaptive fractionation, depending on its total volume within 1,3 or 5 fractions. An elective volume of 2 cm around the GTV (clinical target volume (CTV)), plus a 1mm (Cyberknife®)- 3mm (TrueBeam®) isotropic margin will be treated at constant doses by fractionation cohort. These planning target volumes (PTVs) will be cropped at 5mm to skin and chest wall. The principle of irradiating an ""elective volume"" around the GTV will be used in this study, as done by Vasmel et al. \[3\]. This is decided because uncertainties do exist concerning true micro- and macrometastatic extension around the tumor, as visualized in the CT and delineation of the tumor on injected CT scans is not expected to be sufficient for coverage of macro and micrometastatic disease. Breast MRI is concordant to tumor size, as evaluated in pathology, within 0.5 cm for 53% of patients \[4\]. Organs at risk will be defined according to international guidelines \[5\].

Enrolment will be performed within 1-8 weeks after discussion in the HUG Breast Cancer Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (MTB).

All patients diagnosed with BC in our Institution, presenting the aforementioned characteristics, are candidates for screening for participation in the study, and will be offered clip placement, when feasible, during diagnostic biopsy by the specialized radiologist. Screening criteria will be assessed by the radiologist and radiation oncologist at the time of diagnostic biopsy.

Pre-screened patients will be discussed at the Institutional BC MTB. Eligible patients will be considered for the study.

Treatment procedures Treatment planning: Treatment planning will be performed using appropriate TPS (Eclipse®, (Varian, Palo Alto, US) or Accuray Precision®), with relevant techniques of SBRT in order to provide dose-delivery optimizations respecting predefined criteria for target coverage and normal-tissue constraints.

Accuracy issues: Accuracy of target volume delineation and dose delivery are of outmost importance for both tumor control and toxicity avoidance, given the limited number of fractions delivered. Accuracy issues are further detailed in the protocol section 3.4.1.

Quality assurance: A quality assurance (QA) program accompanies this trial, consisting of review of treatment plans by the trial medical physicist and the coordinating investigator.

SBRT fractionation will be adapted to PTV-GTV and PTV-CTV final volumes. With increasing volumes, more fractions will be used, according to the algorithm presented below, representing the dose-adapted fractionation regimens. SBRT will be delivered with isoeffective doses: a single fraction of 21, 23, or 25 Gy on day 1 or in three fractions of 11, 13 or 14 Gy/fraction on days 1, 3 and 5 or in five fractions of 8 or 9 or 10 Gy/fraction on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Dose per adaptive regimen will be escalated every three patients if no DLT appears.

In addition, patients will undergo physical exams at each study visit and (Serious) Adverse Events ((S)AE)s will be recorded. Questionnaires will be given to patients at selected study visits to assess Quality of Life (QoL).

A soybean oil emulsion, rich in the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid, will serve as control.","Rationale: Fish oil (FO), rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, exerts a range of anti-inflammatory actions that render it a potential therapeutic agent to treat Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the bowel. Recent evidence suggests that a lack of effect in previous studies might be due to the fact that genetic background was not taken into account. For instance, a study in healthy subjects showed that production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) following FO supplementation decreased in individuals within the highest tertile of pre-supplementational TNF-α production, remained unaltered in the middle tertile, and increased in the lowest tertile of pre-supplementational TNF-α production. TNF-α plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, hence the treatment with anti-TNF-α agents. Based on these notions, and because FO supplementation via the enteral route is strongly dose limited due to fat-induced side effects such as diarrhea, we hypothesize that parenteral FO supplementation might be beneficial in those patients with Crohn's disease with a high inherent TNF-α production.

Study design: Single center, randomized, single blinded, lipid-controlled, cross-over pilot trial.

Study population: Adult patients with Crohn's disease with previous bowel surgery, currently in remission (without the need for immunosuppressive drugs) and with a high inherent TNF-α production.

Intervention: First, patients with a high inherent TNF-α will be identified by assessment of TNF-α production in a group 100 patients who meet in- and exclusion criteria. Patients within the highest tertile will be classified as high producers. Next, 5 patients within the highest tertile will be randomized to receive intravenous administration of 20% (w/v) lipid-control (Intralipid®), and, after crossing over, 10% (w/v) fish oil emulsion (Omegaven®), or vice-versa for 1 hour on three consecutive days at a dose of 0.2 g/kg bodyweight /hr.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Early (T=day 4) and late (T=day 11) effects of infusions on TNF-α production by whole blood cultures. Secondary outcomes: effect on leukocyte counts, leukocyte functions and on (anti-)oxidant status, the occurrence of oxidative damage and analysis of specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) related to TNF-α production.",COMPLETED,,2014-01,2015-09,2015-05,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,SINGLE,TREATMENT,6,ESTIMATED

In this procedure, an average of 4 needle passes (needle sticks) is needed to collect enough tissue for diagnosis. However, the number of passes can be higher or lower, depending on the individual lesion and success of the needle passes.

If participant agrees to take part in this study, 2 different needles (the standard straight hollow-core needle and the new EchoTip® Procore™ needle) will be used to sample the pancreas lesion. Two (2) passes will be performed with each needle type and compared. If additional passes are needed for diagnosis, they will not be included in this study. After the first set of needle passes, the doctor may decide that more passes are needed.

Final test results will be taken from the diagnostic results from each needle pass. The results from both types of the needle will be included in the participant's medical record.

This is an investigational study. All needles used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available. Comparing the needles is investigational.

Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",COMPLETED,,2012-01-30,2017-07-06,2017-07-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,60,ACTUAL

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Erlotinib may interfere with the growth of tumor cells, slow the growth of the tumor, and make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib and temozolomide with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.","PILOT STUDY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib administered with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or other grade 4 brain tumors who are currently on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant (EIAC) therapy vs no EIAC therapy.

II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of 1-year survival, in these patients.

PHASE II OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

II. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

NCT04521894,The Application Value of 18F-prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT in Prostate Cancer,Diagnostic Performance of 18F-prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-1007 PET/CT in the Detection of Prostate Cancer,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common type of malignant tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among men worldwide. The biological behaviors of PCa at different degrees of malignancy also largely differ, directly impacting disease outcomes and responses to treatment. Therefore, accurate risk stratification of PCa before treatment and the development of an individualized treatment regimen, play a vital role to improve the clinical outcome of patients. However, overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies, which are invasive examinations associated with higher costs and adverse effects. When the PSA is less than 20ng/mL, less than 1% of PCa patients have a positive bone scan, and routine bone scans are not recommended for asymptomatic or low-risk PCa patients. Interestingly, due to the variations among evaluators that often occur when defining the T stage, biopsies operate inaccuracy, also low-PSA level can also occur metastasis, there is a need for an objective and accurate imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of different grade PCa.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane protein, which has higher expression in cancerous prostate cells than in normal prostate cells. Meanwhile, its expression level is positively correlated with the degree of malignancy, the tendency of metastasis, and the risk of early recurrence. In recent years, 18F-PSMA positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PSMA PET/CT) has earned widespread attention as a novel imaging modality based on molecular-level analysis, rather than morphological or physiological analysis, to assist in PCa diagnosis and tumor burden evaluation.

Currently, Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) is the most commonly used semi-quantitative parameter in PET/CT, which is used to assess tumor burden of PCa, and thus can be used as an imaging biomarker to assess the degree of malignancy of prostate cancers. However, prior studies mainly focused on the correlation between patients' biochemical recurrence lesions and the PSA levels and Gleason score. There is a lack of research to explore the correlation among primary PCa burden, PSA levels, and the degree of prostate cancer malignancy. The aim of this project is to use 18F-PSMA PET/CT SUVmax to analyze the correlation among primary PCa imaging, and clinical indicators, and to evaluate the predictive value for PCa risk stratification, metastasis risk, and biochemical recurrence.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the highest malignant male tumor and one of the leading causes of mortality among men worldwide. The biological behaviors of PCa malignancy are largely heterogeneous, directly impacting prognostic grouping and treatment options. In addition, assessments of the distant metastatic status for PCa patients have recently received increasing attention due to the heightening mortality rate. Therefore, the precise systemic staging of primary PCa risk stratification before treatment plays a crucial role in designing the management strategy for the individualized treatment option. According to both American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, patients with total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) \> 20 ng/mL and/or Gleason Score ≥ 8 are high-risk, the probability of distant metastasis and mortality will increase significantly and may not suitable for active surveillance programs, radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy treatment. However, tPSA is organ-specific but not tumor-specific, the biological behaviors of prostate malignancy are largely heterogeneous, and the specificity of the ability of tPSA to reflect distant metastasis remains debatable. Using tPSA as the only indicator for risk stratification discrimination and distant metastases prediction may causing in large numbers of unnecessary prostate biopsies. Also, elderly patients with severe comorbidities or undergoing anticoagulation therapy may not be the optimal candidates for biopsies and may cause adverse effects and higher costs. In these cases, it is urgent to find objective and accurate imaging biomarkers for risk stratification classification with a noninvasive approach based on imaging analysis.

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is primarily expressed in prostatic tissues, and its expression is correlated with the degree of malignancy and further increases in metastatic. The ability of PSMA to easily penetrate tissues and diffuse with solid tumor lesions can reflect the statuses of metastasis. Prior studies show that PSMA PET/CT is superior to conventional imaging methods for lymph node metastatic detection and that the pre-treatment tPSA level and Gleason Score are associated with the PSMA uptake in primary PCa. Furthermore, the Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) is the most commonly used semi-quantitative parameter in PET/CT and prior studies have already been used to assess the degree of malignancy of PCa and predict extended pelvic lymph node metastases in intermediate to high-risk PCa patients by 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 68Ga-PSMA-617. 18F-PSMA-1007 is advantaged by its higher spatial resolution images and non-urinary excretion that reduces urinary clearance, this approach bears a great potential to facilitate the detection of primary PCa and metastatic lesions. However, to our knowledge, no prior studies have employed 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT to evaluate the diagnostic performance in risk stratification and distant metastases prediction in primary PCa.

The present study aims to retrospective investigated the role of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT semi-quantitative parameters correlation among newly diagnosed PCa imaging, tPSA levels and Gleason Score, and to evaluate the prediction performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and clinicopathologic characteristics on PCa risk stratification and distant metastatic prediction.",UNKNOWN,,2021-08-22,2023-08-31,2023-08-31,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,500,ESTIMATED

Statement of Problem

Despite the increasing knowledge concerning PCOS, the global picture of the disorder is deficient in a number of geographic regions. Understanding the global prevalence and phenotypic presentation of any common disorder, including PCOS, allows for:

1. A determination of the prevalence and associated morbidities of the disorder, to better assess the public health and economic implications of PCOS in this region.
2. A determination of the phenotype of PCOS in this region, allowing for improved screening methods.
3. The elucidation of underlying environmental or ethnic factors that may affect the prevalence, severity or complications of the disorder, via comparison of data between countries.
4. The elucidation of genetic variants underlying the disorder in this region, fostering and improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder and a better understanding of the evolutionary selection processes that have paradoxically resulted in the current high prevalence of the disorder in the face of obvious reproductive deficits.

Benefit These data would not only lead to an improved understanding of the public health implications of the disorder in Trinidad but also potentially highlight novel etiologic avenues and therapeutic targets.

Aims and objectives

Primary:

1. To determine the prevalence of PCOS among women of reproductive age (a selected population (18 to 45)) in Trinidad.

   Secondary
2. To determine the distribution of phenotypes among women diagnosed with PCOS in the above objective overall and by ethnicity. PCOS sub-phenotypes are as follows: Phenotype A - clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA) and oligi-/anovulation (OA), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM); B - HA and OA; C - HA and PCOM; and D - OA and PCOM;
3. To determine the risks for, metabolic syndrome, depression, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, fibroids, and general health issues for PCOS women versus women without PCOS in the age groups 18 - 45 years.
4. To determine the genotype of PCOS in Trinidad. Outcome measures and variables Outcome measures (dependent variables) c) Primary outcome ii) Prevalence of PCOS and its symptoms d) Secondary outcome iv) Phenotype of PCOS v) Genotype of PCOS vi) Prevalence and prevalence rationale for PCOS subphenotypes in Trinidad, odds ratio for metabolic syndrome, depression, obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, fibroids, and general patient health issues, adjusted for age, ethnicity, BMI, treatment (OCP), and socioeconomic parameters.

   Covariates (independent variables)
   1. Socio-demographic variables
   2. Baseline characteristics

   Methodology Study design This is a prospective, cross-sectional study. The study will be conducted among females in Trinidad from different geographical locations.

   Study population Based on a review of nine studies conducted in the general population, a conservative prevalence estimate for PCOS, using the Rotterdam 2003 definition, is 13.4%. Based on this formula, a sample size of 495 untreated individuals will be required to determine the prevalence with an absolute error of 3%. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, 990 women would need to be approached for study inclusion. The study population will be females of reproductive age from Trinidad.

   Strategies for Sampling, Recruitment and Retention Participants will be samples proportionally from all 8 zones in Trinidad. Approximately 124 women in the reproductive age (18 - 45 years old) will be randomly sampled from each zone. Houses will be numbered and random numbers of these houses will be generated using a random number calculator. In each sampled house, females would be prescreened and those that satisfy our inclusion criteria would be selected.

   Telephone numbers of participants will be obtained and follow-up calls made.

   Sampling units are defined as individual unselected women between the ages of 18 and 45 years, identified in the community. The investigators target power analysis on women who do not use hormonal contraception. The investigators assume a conservative response rate of 50% of sampled women. This response rate includes the following parameters: use of hormone/contraceptive use (15%), excluded due to hysterectomy or ovariectomy (3%), excluded due to pregnancy (2%), refusal to participate (20%), and study drop-out/lost to follow-up (10%).

   A conservative prevalence estimate for PCOS based on a review of nine studies conducted in the general population using the Rotterdam 2003 definition is 13.4%. Using the above formula, a sample size of 495 individuals will be required to determine the prevalence with an absolute error of ±3%. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, 990 women would need to be approached for study inclusion.

   Selection criteria Inclusion criteria
   1. Female, ages 18 to 45 years., all ethnic backgrounds.
   2. The participants must have at least one of the following two features:

   i) Dermatological signs or complaints of clinical hyperandrogenism such as unwanted facial or body hair, loss of scalp hair (alopecia) or persistent acne (pimple).

   ii) Signs or complaints of ovulatory dysfunction such as irregular menses (oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhea or polymenorrhoea), history of anovulation or ultrasonographic findings of polycystic ovarian morphology.

   Exclusion criteria
   1. Women less than 18 years or older than 45 years
   2. Women who are pregnant at the time of evaluation
   3. Postmenopausal women
   4. Women who had undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy
   5. Anything that would place the individual at increased risk or preclude the individuals' compliance with or completion of the study.
   6. Unwillingness to participate or difficulty understanding the consent process or the study objectives and requirements.

      Sampling technique A consecutive sampling technique will be used for each phase of the study. Consecutive study participants, who meet the selection criteria and give informed written consent, will be recruited for the study. A unique serial identification number will be given to each study participant until the intended sample is attained.

      Study procedure Potential study participants from selected geographical locations will be invited to participate in the study. A confidential study register containing details of potential study participants (name, age, height, weight, blood pressure and contact phone number) will be kept. Potential study participants will be counseled on the objectives of the study and the study protocol. If the potential participant refuses to participate, no further contact will be made with the participant. Inform consent (see attached) will be obtained from each eligible study participant before recruitment for the study. A subject tracking log for longitudinal observation study will be used to track eligible subjects.

      After an informed consent, data will be collected from each study participant using a standard format in a clinical report form (CRF) for uniform data collection from all participants. Each CRF will contain a unique serial identification number. The CRF will be filled by a suitably trained researcher (including the PI, co-investigators and medically trained research assistants). All CRF will be checked for missing data within 24 hours of completion, and any missing data will be detected and collected immediately.

      Each participant will undergo anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist, circumference and hip circumference) and physical examination for hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans. Participants with an initial hirsutism (mFG) score of 3 or more will be re-assessed by a physician.

      Laboratory investigations will be scheduled during the morning hours (08:00 to 10:00 hours), for blood collection.

      After overnight fasting (of 8 hours or more), 10 ml of venous blood sample will be collected from each study participant. About half (5 ml) of the venous blood will be collected in an EDTA- containing tube for plasma/DNA and the remaining in a plain tube for serum.

      All blood samples will be stored and transported to the laboratory in cooler boxes containing ice packs immediately after collection. At the laboratory, the sample will be separated into serum, plasma and whole blood by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. The biological specimens will be stored, in small aliquots (of 0.5 ml), in 1.5 to 2.0 ml plastic containers (about 12 cryovials) able to withstand temperatures of -80 degrees.

      Samples for hormonal assay and initial evaluation will be batched at regular intervals for analysis to provide study participants with timely results, allow classification of participants, and minimize the impact of inter-assay variability. At the end of the study, a repeat analysis of biological samples for androgen levels and insulin estimation will be performed at a reference laboratory (Eric William Medical Science Complex).

      Each subject will also complete the following standardized data instruments or forms as appropriate: FG Score self-assessment, SF-12, and Beck depression inventory assessment (see attached).

      The genetic analysis will be performed at the Laboratory at the Department of Pre-clinical Sciences. The initial evaluation and classification of study participants will be done using the flow chart/diagnostic tree by Prof. Azzizz one of the investigators on this project.

      Related or mimicking disorders will be excluded using history, physical examination, and serum TSH, prolactin and 17-OH progesterone. Participants with hypothyroidism on thyroxine replacement therapy will not be recruited for the study until TSH level is normal. Study participants with elevated 17-OH progesterone 2ng/dl (or 200 ng/dl) will have non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH).

      Data collection instrument:

      The methods of collecting data for the assessment of study objectives include the use of standardized interview-based medical forms; surveys; physical examinations.

      The CRF developed for this study includes; a clinical and anthropometric section and a laboratory result section. The questionnaire section will seek information on socio-demographic variables, reproductive history with an emphasis on menstrual cycle (dating and regularity) and gynecological history, hirsutism, acne, medications, and family history. The anthropometry and clinical section will document the physical findings such as hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and acanthosis nigricans. Subjects will also complete the following standardized data instruments or forms as appropriate: FG Score self-assessment, SF-12, Beck depression inventory, and Epworth sleepiness scale.

      A summary of initial and follow-up procedures.
      1. Physical Exam

         A physical exam will include:
         * Baseline medical examination and
         * Study specific procedures as outlined above.
      2. Baseline medical examination will include • Waist-to-circumference ratio

         * Height measurement
         * Weight measurement
         * Hirsutism assessment
         * Acne assessment
         * Alopecia assessment
         * Acanthosis nigricans assessment

           * Waist and hip circumferences measurement The following measures will be obtained with the subject standing: a) the waist circumference, measured as the circumferential measurement encompassing the lower borders of the 10th rib at the mid-axillary lines; and b) the iliac crest (hip) circumference, measured as the circumferential measurement obtained at the height of the iliac crests, with the tape maintained parallel to the floor. The waist and hip circumferences will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. The waist divided by the iliac crest (hip) circumference will be used to calculate the waist-hip ratio
           * Hirsutism assessment Hirsutism assessment will be performed using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual hirsutism score scale, by trained study personnel. Inter-reviewer variation will be assessed between study investigators. Photographic examples of each grade will be provided to investigators, as well as training to study personnel.

      mFG scoring will be performed as follows: • Nine body areas are assessed, including the upper lip, chin, chest, upper back, lower back, upper arm, upper and lower abdomen, and thighs.
      * A score of 0 to 4 is assigned to each area examined, based on the density of terminal hairs. A score of 0 represents the absence of terminal hairs, a score of 1 minimal terminal hair growth, a score of 2 mild terminal hair growth, a score of 3 moderate hair growth, and a score of 4 severe terminal hair growth (i.e., like that of a hairy man).

        o Terminal hairs represent hairs that if not cut or trimmed would grow \>5 mm in length, are usually pigmented, and are coarser and harder than the softer surrounding vellus hairs, as they have a compact medulla (core) of melanocytes within.
      * Each body area on the mFG form is circled accordingly, leaving those areas with a score of zero blank.

      The scores are summed up to for the 'Total modified FG score'. If patients use permanent/long term epilation or shave hairs, that fact will be recorded on the mFG score sheet.

      • In addition, all subjects will self-score their body and facial hair growth, marking on the mFG score sheet. The subjects will be provided the same mFG score sheet that is used by medical personnel, and will be instructed by trained personnel to circle on the sheet their own body areas they perceive to be affected by excess hair growth. Before they do so the trained personnel will provide them with a short instructional - covering how mFG is performed, what the scores 0 through 4 mean, what terminal hair growth means, and what each body area covers.

      - Acne assessment Assessment of acne will be made by trained personnel; using a standard acne lesion assessment.

      • Acne is scored according to whether it is grade 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). Mild acne is characterized by the presence of few to several papules and pustules, but no nodules.

      • Moderate acne by the presence of several to many papules and pustules, along with a few to several nodules.

      • Severe acne by the presence of numerous or extensive papules and pustules, as well as many nodules.
      * Alopecia assessment The Ludwig Scale will be used to diagnose the severity of female hair loss. From left to right in the image below, these Types include Class I, Class II, and Class III: (Attached)
      * Acanthosis nigricans assessment

        * All areas demonstrating acanthosis nigricans should be checked and indicated (see attached).
        * No score is used to denote severity.

3. Screening blood samples for evaluation PCOS Inclusion/Exclusion labs

* TSH\*\*
* PRL\*\*
* 17-OHP\*\*\*
* P4++
* oGTT\*\* \* To be determined in the local clinical lab (MDS Biochemistry Laboratory) in UWI, Trinidad.

  * All subjects. \*\*\* For subjects with oligomenorrhea and/or hirsutism and/or PCOM only, who do not use Hormonal Contraception (HC).

    * For subjects with hirsutism and/or PCOM, who have apparently regular menstrual bleeding a day 22-24 progesterone (P4) level will be obtained.

FUNCTIONAL TESTING Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Stimulation Test

An acute ACTH stimulation test is a clinical test performed to exclude 21-hydroxylase deficient nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH), if the screening (basal) 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-HP) level is 2 ng/mL (200 ng/dL) or 6.0 nmol/L. This test may also be performed on included subjects, such as controls, for further phenotyping. For androgen excess and/or PCOS patients, an ACTH stimulation test may be part of their standard clinical evaluation if basal 17-HP levels are elevated. The test will be performed as follows:

* The subject will come in between 7-10 am in the morning.
* A small indwelling catheter will be placed in a vein in an arm and a blood sample is drawn through the intravenous catheter (0 min sample).
* 250 mcg of 1-24 ACTH (Cortrosyn®) is then injected through the catheter. The injection is performed over 60 seconds by a physician.
* Sixty minutes after the injection, a second blood sample (60 min, sample) is drawn. • The total amount of blood drawn is 60 ml.

Laboratory evaluations and sample storage in research. Research lab

* SHBG
* Total and Free Testosterone
* DHEAS
* Blood for DNA extraction for later genetic analysis • Extra blood for repository

DNA Core Facility The investigators will obtain blood for DNA extraction since all subjects will undergo standard phenotyping. Blood (in EDTA tubes) will be sent to the Biochemistry Laboratory at Preclinical Sciences, UWI where DNA will be extracted and stored for future analyses. The primary purpose is to serve as a repository to participate in genome wide association studies. In both cases, there will be no release of personal identifiers, and we the investigaotrs will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality, as done in prior studies. This will be a part of the initial protocol, though subjects will have the option to opt out of this segment of the study or limit the use of their specimen on the consent form. This resource may also prove useful for genome wide association studies or other studies of the genetics of PCOS, oligomenorrhea, and hyperandrogenism.

At this time no genetic analyses are proposed as the number of subjects being collected are insufficient for any significant genetic study. However, as it is the investigators hope that this study will serve as the anchor for subsequent investigations of women's health and PCOS in Trinidad, the investigators intend to isolate and store DNA in the subjects examined in the study. The samples will be stored at The University of the West Indies. If in the future a decision is made to study the DNA samples accumulated, perhaps along with other samples collected, then we the investigators will apply for an amendment for genetic analysis.

NCT04990960,Experimental Study About Physiotherapy Treatment vs Self-treatment In Axillary Web Syndrome After Axillary Dissection,Experimental Study About Efficacy Of Physiotherapy Treatment vs Self-treatment In Axillary Web Syndrome After Axillary Dissection In Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND Dissection and removal of Lymph nodes in the Axilla (ALND) remains a method used in breast cancer management across the world. Post- surgical scar tissue that forms in this dissection is therefore beyond the linear scar, is characterized by less elasticity than healthy tissue and can over time, because of the anatomical location, cause significant limitations of the Active Range of Motion (AROM) of the scapulohumeral joint. After this procedure it's possible that Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) occurs. This study discusses the physiotherapy management of patients with AWS. The primary objective of the study was to verify direct and indirect changes to AWS cords with two treatment methods at a single breast cancer rehabilitation setting: Physiotherapist 's work Vs. Self-treatment.","Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women. Axillary surgical procedures have reported, with post-operative morbidity of bleeding, lymphedema and shoulder pain, also the rather underestimated Axillary Web Syndrome. The study shows that the reduction of the problems linked to the Syndrome such as pain in shoulder Abduction and Flexion and inability in everyday life is possible with an early and competent treatment. Two different approaches to the Syndrome were investigated. The patients were divided in two groups. Good results were obtained within 5 weeks since the appearance of AWS with both of them but if the Physiotherapist is able to teach the convenient exercises, the selftreatment seemed to have the best outcome. This fact can change the awareness that an early approach is necessary inside the path to recovery. In the last years the Axillary Web Syndrome was the topic of many studies: the etiology, its clinical diagnosis, the relation with lymphedema...But the treatment was often reported like a combination of different techniques without indications about kinds, times. Instead the investigators examined a detailed procedure, the same in both groups. The work was different only as regards the cords treatment. This fact shows the value of a comprehensive treatment for neck, shoulder, breast and two different but specific works on the Axillary Web Syndrome. For these reasons its publishing could be important for all the professionals working with women after Surgery for breast cancer and metastatic lymphnodes.",COMPLETED,,2017-10-01,2019-10-30,2019-09-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,19,ACTUAL

Pre-surgical chemotherapy has been advocated for these patients because of putative improvement in event-free survival (EFS). The advantages of pre-surgical chemotherapy include early administration of systemic chemotherapy, shrinkage of primary tumor, and pathologic identification of risk groups. The theoretic disadvantage is that it exposes a large tumor burden to marginally effective chemotherapy, especially in the axial region. The contribution of chemotherapy and surgery timing has not been tested rigorously. To study the effect of the timing of surgery on outcome of patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of pelvis and sacrum, we conducted multicenter randomized trial to determine whether chemotherapy administered before definitive resection of primary tumors improved EFS and overall survival compared with traditional resection of the primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.",UNKNOWN,,2018-08-01,2025-02,2020-02,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,100,ESTIMATED

Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating children who have refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate (overall and within strata) in both minimally pretreated, low-risk and heavily pretreated, high-risk children with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with ifosfamide and vinorelbine with filgrastim (G-CSF).
* Determine the cardiac, hepatic, renal, and hematologic toxicity of this regimen in minimally-pretreated, low-risk patients.
* Determine the toxic death rate in minimally pretreated, low-risk patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine whether this treatment regimen can mobilize sufficient hematopoietic stem cells (CD34) for subsequent stem cell transplantation in minimally pretreated, low-risk patients.
* Determine the incidence of hypermutability by longitudinal genotoxic biomonitoring of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the prognostic significance of biological markers, including serum interleukin (IL)-10 receptor, serum IL-2 receptor, p53, and mdm-2 in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by prior therapy (minimally pretreated, low-risk vs heavily pretreated, high-risk).

Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 and vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV over 15-30 minutes beginning 24-36 hours after completion of vinorelbine and continuing daily until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats at least every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive a third course of therapy at the discretion of the investigator.

Heavily pretreated, high-risk patients who achieve a complete response are eligible for stem cell transplantation. Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection during hematopoietic recovery after the second course of chemotherapy. Patients with sufficient PBSCs collected may undergo PBSC transplantation on protocol COG-AHOD0121.

Pneumatic compression devices are also known as sequential compression devices and are inflatable compression sleeves that are placed around patient's legs to reduce the risk of clot formation deep vein thrombosis. Pneumatic compression devices are made of a soft material that wraps around the lower leg and periodically squeeze the calf. A deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot. Most hospitalized patients wear these as a preventive measure. Pneumatic compression devices alone are not sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis formation. Therefore, medicines, such as aspirin and enoxaparin are utilized. Both drugs are used for prevention, but there are no studies in patients with musculoskeletal tumors which have determined whether one drug is better than another. The knowledge gained from this study will determine whether aspirin and pneumatic compression devices is the same or better than enoxaparin and pneumatic compression devices in preventing deep vein thrombosis in this patient population and may result in fewer wound and bleeding complications","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To perform a randomized prospective study to determine efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)+pneumatic compression device (PCD) prophylaxis compared to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)+PCD in patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures for musculoskeletal neoplasms (MSN) of the pelvis and lower extremity.

II. To prove that ASA+PCD is clinically equivalent to or better than LMWH+PCD in providing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in this patient population and results in fewer major bleeding complications.

III. To measure rates of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) as primary outcomes.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To measure secondary outcomes including rates of readmission, reoperation, bleeding complications (including hematoma formation and prolonged wound drainage), and death.

NCT02285660,Evaluation of 4D-contrast Enhanced PET-CT in Tumour Volume Definition,"Evaluation of 4D-contrast Enhanced PET-CT in Tumour Volume Definition for Patients With Lung, Lower Oesophageal and Pancreatic Carcinomas.","The aim of high dose radiotherapy treatment is to deliver enough radiation to the tumour to kill all the cancer cells while at the same time giving a low dose of radiation to the normal parts of the body to reduce the side effects of treatment. This requires the cancer specialist to accurately identify the areas of cancer on a computed tomography (CT) scan. Positron emission tomography computed tomography (PETCT) scans use radioactive sugar that is injected into the patient. This sugar goes into cancer cells and shows up as a bright spot on the PET scan, allowing the doctors to see tumours more accurately. Some cancers move with breathing, for example lung, pancreas and oesophageal (or gullet) cancers. Fourdimensional CT scanning (4DCT) is a special type of CT scan that allows the motion of the tumour to be seen and measured accurately. This information can then be used to help ensure that the radiotherapy correctly treats the moving tumour.

The aim of this study is to see if there are possible benefits to combining PET with 4DCT to get a 4D PETCT scan for tumours that move with breathing. This study is divided into three cancer types; lung, lower oesophagus and pancreatic cancer.

First the investigators are going to test the use of 4D PETCT in the radiotherapy planning of these tumours to see if it helps the doctor to identify the cancer.

Secondly, the investigators are going to see if the 4D PETCT helps to show areas within the cancer that are potentially more active. This might then allow us to target a higher dose to these areas, which could potentially improve the chance of controlling and curing the cancer.

For each arm of the study the following sample size is required:

* First step: 23 patients, for a total of 69 patients in all 3 arms
* Second step: further 33 patients, for a total of 168 patients in all 3 arms.","Treatment Plan Patient will continue to be treated with the same hormone therapy at the same dose, route and schedule

Patients will be randomized to receive:

A: Lapatinib, 1250 mg/die, os B: Metformin, 1500 mg/die, os C: Lapatinib + Metformin, 1250 mg+1500 mg/die, os Patients will receive study treatment until disease progression is documented, extraordinary medical circumstances occur, intolerable toxicities occur, or the patient withdraws consent

Statistical consideration Randomization will be stratified according to the site of metastases: visceral versus non-visceral lesions. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of patients free of disease progression at 3 months from randomization. The final analysis of this objective will be conducted when a total of 168 patients are enrolled across the three arms. This is the number of patients needed for a test with an experiment-wise alpha = 0.05 and power = 80% to show a statistically significant increment of 10% to the rate of patients without disease progression at 3 months, assuming a rate of 5% for treatments without lapatinib and/or metformin (P0=5% and P1=15%). After having accrued a total of 23 evaluable patients in each arm, the trial design can proceed to step 2 randomizing additional patients to each arm only if two or more patients are free of disease progression at 3 months. Otherwise, the study arm with less than expected responses will be discontinued. In the second stage 33 additional patients will be enrolled in each study arm to reach a total of 56 total patients per arm. If less than 6 patients per arm will be free of disease progression then the increment of corresponding treatment will be considered not significant.

Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However, hormone pills usually work for about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on, breast cancer will start to grow again. This condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called ""endocrine resistant"" breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests, the investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make letrozole work again. However, it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in humans.

The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole, lapatinib, and everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work.

Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of breast cancer called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. HER2 is a protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also include patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these patients do not depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is considered experimental.

Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer. Initial studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that everolimus may also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental in this study.","This is a single-institution clinical trial. Patients will be stratified according to the HER2 status:

Group 1: HER2-positive in the tumor tissue Group 2: HER2 negative in the tumor tissue

In the first part of the study, all of the patients will receive the combination of lapatinib 1,500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. We do not expect any significant toxicity from this combination since the previous study of lapatinib and letrozole showed that this combination is safe with no grade 3-4 toxicities observed. Restaging scans (CT scan, MRI, or bone scan) will be obtained after every 12 weeks of treatment.

NCT05451576,Sodium Selenite Supplementation in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer,The Role of Sodium Selenite Supplementation in Patients With Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy,"The micronutrient selenium is an essential trace element in the human body. There are more than 25 proteins in the human body contain selenium, such as glutathione peroxidase and selenoprotein, which regulate the body's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous literatures had shown cancer patients have lower serum selenium concentrations than normal people, and lower serum selenium levels may be associated with increased cancer mortality. More than 50% of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are malnourished before treatment, and these patients often have deficiency of trace elements, including selenium. In these malnourished patients, they may have to endure increased treatment toxicity and treatment interruption when receiving standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Interruption of treatment may lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy and compromised survival and recurrence rate. Several small studies have investigated whether oral administration of sodium selenite in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy can improve side effects and affect survival rates, but the results are inconsistent. Our study will use the intravenous form of sodium selenite (Zelnite®) to investigate the effect of selenium on the treatment outcomes of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing CCRT, such as therapy-related toxicities, quality of life, changes in selenium concentration in blood, nutritional, inflammation and immune markers, and tracking long-term survival and recurrence rates.","Selenium is an essential trace element for humans. It is involved in redox regulation, antioxidant functions, membrane integrity, and protection against DNA injury. In both animal models and human studies, it has been shown that selenium has cancer-protective effects and cytoprotective activities. Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the anti-cancer effects of selenium, which include the antioxidant properties by selenoproteins, induction of conjugating enzymes that detoxify carcinogens, enhancement of the immune response, alterations in DNA methylation and blockage of the cell cycle to allow DNA repair.

There has been conflicting response regarding selenium supplementation on the reduction of toxicity, antitumor efficacy and their quality of life in patients receiving radiotherapy. In the studies by Kiremidjian-Schumacher et al. and Elango et. al, sodium selenite supplementation was shown to significantly enhance cell-mediated immune responsiveness and improve defense systems in head and neck cancer patients. Micke et al. and Zimmerman et al. demonstrated the quality of life of patients suffering from head and neck cancer with lymphedema significantly improved after selenium supplementation. In the study by Büntzel et al., selenium supplementation reduced the radiation-associated side-effects of dysphagia developments in patients with head and neck cancer patients.

However, some studies showed negative response of selenium supplementation in head and neck cancer patients. Weijl et al. showed oral selenium supplementation did not show improvement in cisplatin-induced toxicity or response rate in cancer patients. In the study by Mix et al., addition of oral selenium supplementation was well-tolerated but did not lower the incidence of severe mucositis or improve quality of life or survival outcomes in head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiation (CRT). An early systematic review in Cochrane demonstrated there was still insufficient evidence to conclude efficacy of selenium in alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatments.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of intravenous selenium supplementation on the treatment outcome of head and neck patients undergoing CCRT (toxicities, quality of life, overall survival, progression-free survival), selenium concentration changes during CCRT, and its correlation with nutritional, inflammation and immune markers.",RECRUITING,,2020-08-12,2024-06-30,2023-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,60,ESTIMATED

A combination of vitamin D and celecoxib act synergistically to decrease breast cancer risk by decreasing cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium through their action on prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism.

Specific Aims:

In women at increased breast cancer risk, determine the effect of vitamin D, with or without celecoxib, on

1. PG synthesis and metabolism, through the measurement of 15-PGDH, COX-2, and PGE2 in the breast

   Rationale: 1,25(OH)2D, the active form of vitamin D, has been shown in vitro to decrease PGE2 both by interfering with its production and by increasing its breakdown, leading to lower cell proliferation. Celecoxib potentiated the antiproliferative effect, allowing a much lower dose of each agent when used in combination than in isolation.
2. Proliferative activity in the breast, as measured by Mammary Ductoscopy (MD) cell morphology

   Rationale: Both MD and Nipple Aspirate Fluid (NAF) contain ductal epithelial cells, but MD samples contain more cells for cytologic review than NAF. Findings on MD cytology correlate with likelihood of breast cancer (2), NAF cytology relates to breast cancer risk and improves risk stratification (3), and bioactive food components can alter NAF cytology (4).

NCT00341276,Esophageal Cancer Genetics Studies,Esophageal Cancer Genetics Studies,"The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of genetics in the etiology and prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancer, primarily esophageal cancer, but also cancers of the gastric cardia and body.

Esophageal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in China and the seventh most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in the etiology of this malignancy, and identification of esophageal cancer susceptibility genes may allow screening of populations to identify persons at particularly high risk, who could then be targeted for prevention strategies (e.g., chemoprevention or early detection). There are several lines of evidence supporting the idea that there is genetic susceptibility for esophageal cancer in high-risk Chinese populations, including an association of positive family history with increased risk, evidence of familial aggregation of cases, and segregation analyses suggesting Mendelian inheritance in high-risk families.

Several different but complementary approaches will be used to identify esophageal cancer susceptibility genes. (Because of etiologic similarities and for logistic reasons, parallel efforts will be made with gastric cardia and body cancers.) First, a tumor/non-tumor study will be conducted in which a biological specimen bank consisting of samples (tumor, non-tumor, venous blood, finger stick blood, and buccal cells) from several hundred cases of esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric body cancers will be developed in Taiyuan that can be used for the identification of esophageal (as well as gastric cardia and body) cancer susceptibility genes and potential early genetic markers of these cancers. High-density genome-wide scans with microsatellite markers will be used in a limited number of cases to identify potential hot spots followed by further testing of these hot spots and other candidate markers in additional tumor/non-tumor samples. Premalignant morphologic lesions will also be examined. Second, blood samples for DNA will be collected from approximately 100 healthy individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas to examine potential population differences in polymorphisms for selected genomic markers. Third, a large case-control study with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and body of stomach will be conducted to evaluate polymorphisms in the candidate markers identified in other components of this project, and to evaluate gene-environment interactions. Finally, a family study will be conducted to evaluate linkage of candidate markers with cancer in families having 2 or more cases with cancers of the esophagus, cardia, and/or body of stomach.","The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of genetics in the etiology and prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancer, primarily esophageal cancer, but also cancers of the gastric cardia and body.

Esophageal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in China and the seventh most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in the etiology of this malignancy, and identification of esophageal cancer susceptibility genes may allow screening of populations to identify persons at particularly high risk, who could then be targeted for prevention strategies (e.g., chemoprevention or early detection). There are several lines of evidence supporting the idea that there is genetic susceptibility for esophageal cancer in high-risk Chinese populations, including an association of positive family history with increased risk, evidence of familial aggregation of cases, and segregation analyses suggesting Mendelian inheritance in high-risk families.

Several different but complementary approaches are proposed to identify esophageal cancer susceptibility genes. (Because of etiologic similarities and for logistic reasons, parallel efforts will be made with gastric cardia and body cancers.) First, a tumor/nontumor study will be conducted in which a biological specimen bank consisting of samples (tumor, nontumor, venous blood, finger stick blood, and buccal cells) from a total of approximately 150 cases each of esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric body cancers will be developed in Taiyuan that can be used for the identification of esophageal (as well as gastric cardia and body) cancer susceptibility genes and potential early genetic markers of these cancers. Comparative genomic hybridization and microsatellite markers will be used to scan the genome in up to 20 cases to identify potential hot spots followed by further testing of these hot spots and other candidate markers in additional tumor/nontumor samples. Second, blood samples for DNA will be collected from approximately 100 healthy individuals from high-risk (Yangcheng County) and low-risk (Beijing) areas to examine potential differences in polymorphisms for selected genomic markers. Third, a casecontrol study will be conducted to evaluate hot spots and candidate markers identified from the tumor/nontumor study and potential gene-environment interactions. Finally, a linkage study will be conducted by identifying and collecting information and DNA from cases and first degree relatives in special highly informative families (those with 2 or more cases having obtainable DNA) as well as population-based ascertainment and collection of information and DNA from all new cases from Yangcheng County.",COMPLETED,,1995-07-06,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,7705,ACTUAL

NCT05629494,Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Test,Effect of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs on Serum Prostate Specific Antigen Level,"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men in the Unites States. Nearly 1 million prostate biopsy procedures are performed in the United States annually and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is the primary reason for prostate biopsy in \> 90% of cases. However, at the PSA levels which trigger prostate biopsy, often no cancer is found in prostate biopsy specimens. PSA test can be elevated due to reasons other than cancer such as inflammation or natural variation in the level. Investigators plan to treat men with elevated PSA level with over the counter anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, naproxen) to see if the PSA level will decrease to an acceptable level.","It's known that PSA level can be elevated due to reasons other than prostate cancer including benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis or other urinary tract infections, non-infectious inflammation, and physiologic variation over time. Consequently, nearly 50% of prostate biopsy procedures performed due to elevated PSA level do not yield any cancer , but still expose the patients to the risks of the procedure related complications (discomfort/pain, anxiety, bleeding, infection, and cost). Thus, measures to improve the reliability of PSA test, and potentially avoiding unnecessary procedures, are of significant importance to the patient and healthcare system.

It is common practice to check PSA level annually. PSA test results can vary over time, either due to the imprecision in the analysis and/or due to the biologic variability. This can result in an apparent rise in PSA level when no clinically meaningful rise had occurred. Its estimated that the average lab variation in PSA was approximately 6% and the average biologic variation about 14%. This, it is recommended that isolated elevation in PSA level should be confirmed after several weeks, and before proceeding with further interventions, including prostate biopsy.

Sub-clinical, histologic Inflammation (presence of inflammatory cells) within the prostate tissue and its effect on PSA level has been reported in various settings. In two population-based studies, men who were regularly using over the counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g ibuprofen, naproxen) had lower PSA levels compared to non-users.

Currently, two strategies are utilized in clinical practice to ensure that the PSA level is truly elevated:

1. Repeat PSA test after several weeks or
2. A short course of OTC NSAIDs, and then repeat PSA test

Investigators propose to conduct a randomized study to determine the effect of NSAIDs on PSA level compared to the biologic variations in PSA level noted upon repeat testing.",RECRUITING,,2022-09-27,2026-12-01,2026-03-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,198,ESTIMATED

This study will enroll approximately 480 patients with unresectable advanced ICC who have received no prior systemic therapy. Patients who meet the requirements will be randomly assigned to Treatment Arm A: Toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or Treatment Arm B: Toripalimab, oral placebo, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy or Treatment Arm C: Intravenous placebo, oral placebo, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.

All patients will receive standard chemotherapy (GEMOX or GC per Investigator decision) for a maximum of 8 cycles. After the completion of standard chemotherapy, all patients continue to receive maintenance therapy with toripalimab injection or its placebo in combination with lenvatinib mesylate capsule or its placebo until unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression and loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigators, start of new anti-cancer therapy, death, other conditions requiring termination of study treatment, or the patient meets the criteria for study withdrawal, whichever occurs first.

In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for unconfirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving toripalimab, lenvatinib, or their placebos will be permitted to continue treatment if their clinical status or symptoms are stable or improved (as determined by the investigators) or until loss of clinical benefit. Patients with confirmed disease progression should discontinue toripalimab, lenvatinib, or their placebos.

Tumor assessments will be performed at screening and during the study treatment per protocol. In the absence of progression, tumor assessments will continue as scheduled, regardless of whether study treatment ends, until confirmed disease progression or other criteria for study withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first. Patients who meet RECIST v1.1 criteria for progression should undergo tumor assessments as scheduled if clinical benefits of continuing study treatment are determined by investigators until progression is confirmed per iRECIST (iCPD), or the criteria for study withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.

Computerized tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for efficacy evaluation will be performed at baseline, every 6 weeks (Q6W) in the first year (52 weeks), and every 9 weeks (Q9W) in the second year (after week 52).

All AEs and concomitant medications during the study will be recorded. An end-of-treatment (EOT) visit will be performed within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or termination of study treatment is confirmed by the investigator.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine administered as an intratumoral injection in treating patients with stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

Secondary

* To determine the biologic and clinical responses to therapy.
* To determine treatment-related toxicity using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.
* To identify the MTD.
* To monitor patients for evidence of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine-induced cytokines and antigen-specific immune responses.
* To detect immune responses to tumor-associated antigens and vector.
* To assess patients for objective signs of tumor regression (RECIST Criteria).

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine.

Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain leukocytes for generation of autologous dendritic cells (DC). Adenovirus carrying the CCL21 gene is added to the dendritic cells to make the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks after leukapheresis, patients receive an intratumoral injection of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine under CT-guidance or by bronchoscopy on days 0 and 7. Patients demonstrating a clinical response are eligible to receive a second round of gene transfer at their discretion and in consultation with the FDA.

Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21 vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. An additional 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then on days 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 for safety and immunological studies. Blood samples are analyzed for mycoplasma by PCR; dendritic cell phenotype by flow cytometry; detection of adenovirus CCL21 by nested PCR; and adenoviral antibodies by ELISA. Patients also undergo tissue aspirate or biopsy on days 0 and 7 (during bronchoscopy or CT-guided procedure). Tissue samples are analyzed for immune-modulating cytokines (i.e., IFNγ, CXCL9, and CXCL10) by quantitative RT-PCR; detection of tumor infiltrating leukocytes by immunohistochemistry; CD83+ DC, CXCR3, CCR7, CCL21 and CD3+ T-cells, CD4, and CD8 by flow cytometry; determination of tumor expression of tumor-associated antigen by RT-PCR; and evaluation of immune modulation by ELISPOT assays.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of nasopharyngeal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving bevacizumab together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

NCT06295094,The Efficacy of PIPAC and Minimally Invasive Radical Resection in High-risk Gastric Cancer Patients.,"The Efficacy of Pressurised Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) Combined With CURativE Intent Minimally Invasive Radical Resection in High-risk Gastric Cancer Patients. A Multicentre, Randomised, Open-label Phase-II Study","The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate whether pressurized intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIPAC), delivered immediately after minimally invasive D2 gastrectomy and repeated 6-8 weeks later, improves 12-month peritoneal disease-free survival in patients with high-risk gastric adenocarcinoma when compared to standard treatment.","Despite declining incidence, gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is considered the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death globally. Its incidence varies across different parts of the globe, with a low incidence in the West. In East Asia, especially Japan and Korea, the incidence of distal GAC remains high, whereas proximal GAC tends to dominate in the West. Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas that have the epicentre in the proximal 2 to 5 cm of the stomach (Siewert type III) should be staged and treated as GAC.

The consensus in most Western countries is that medically fit GAC patients should undergo D2 gastrectomy, carried out in specialised, high-volume centres with perioperative outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality rates comparable to those presented in Japan and South Korea. A minimally invasive D2 gastrectomy has emerged as a valid and preferable alternative to open surgery.

Despite significant progress in implementing preventive strategies and curative treatment of premalignant and early neoplastic gastric lesions, most GAC patients still present with advanced stages of the disease, leading to a dismal prognosis even after treatments with curative intent. Given that many patients relapse following surgery, various multimodal treatment strategies have been studied to improve survival rates, mainly by combining surgery with systemic treatment in the form of perioperative chemotherapy. Clinical research has explored and documented the concept of perioperative chemotherapy in GAC and cancers originating in the distal esophagus and GEJ. Noteworthy is that some of these have suggested that the tumours with the most obvious responses to corresponding regimens originate in the esophagus and GEJ. Moreover, GACs of poorly differentiated tubular type or poorly cohesive cancer, regardless the presence of signet-ring cells type has been reported to be more resistant to chemotherapy regimens. Another observation with clinical implications is that GAC patients with malignant cells retrieved from peritoneal lavage before surgery have an extremely poor prognosis. Hence, laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage for malignant cells is recommended in all stage IB-III gastric cancers, otherwise considered potentially resectable, to exclude radiologically occult metastatic disease. The true value of this information may be even greater for patients with T3/T4 disease. Considering the above-mentioned challenges, it is critically important to explore novel multimodal therapeutic concepts in GAC since current therapeutic strategies offer these patients a limited option for cure.

The occurrence of peritoneal metastases (PM) has a significant negative impact on the overall prognosis, with a median survival of three to four months without treatment. None of the available chemotherapy regimens has reduced or prevented the risk of PM. It is commonly believed that PM occur through the deposition of tumour cells either by the direct extension and subsequent cellular exfoliation or through the traumatic dissemination of cancer cells during surgery. Clinical validation of the concept of direct spread is also provided by observing the higher rate of PM seen with increasing tumour stages (T-stages) and serosal involvement. This is also supported by the association of between positive peritoneal cytology and a higher tumour stage.

Sixty percent of lavage cytology-negative patients will convert to a cytology-positive state immediately after gastrectomy. Accordingly, it can be argued that during gastrectomy, cancer cells within the dissected lymphatic channels and blood vessels are released to and disseminated throughout the abdominal cavity. Free cancer cells can then attach to the peritoneal surface, a process facilitated by the action of cytokines and the deposition of fibrin layers, allowing for the entrapment of those cells. This new restrictive-peritoneal environment is thought to hinder the penetrance of cytotoxic drugs delivered systemically and provides grounds for the launch of intraperitoneal treatments.

Based on the minimal effects of traditional regimens on GAC, exploring alternative perioperative therapeutic concepts appears of the highest clinical significance. Since only a fraction of the systemically administered chemotherapy reaches the peritoneum, the effect of intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been extensively studied. A new aerosol technique, Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC), improves intraperitoneal delivery and subsequent uptake of chemotherapy. It has shown promising results in patients with PM from colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. Furthermore, PIPAC is feasible, safe, and well tolerated by many patients when administered in the palliative setting.

Randomised studies on prophylactic treatment of high-risk GAC patients (serosal invasion) using intraperitoneal chemotherapy or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are mainly from Asian institutions. The risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality did not seem to be negatively influenced by intraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, contrasting to western non-randomized trials reporting considerable morbidity and mortality after these combined procedures. Thus, the use of prophylactic HIPEC in non-metastatic high-risk GAC is still debated.

Data from Odense PIPAC Centre on the outcome of PIPAC with low-dose cisplatin and doxorubicin in GAC patients with chemotherapy-resistant PM revealed objective tumour response in 40% of the patients after three PIPAC directed therapies. An additional 20% had no further tumour progression. These observations in GAC patients deliver further evidence suggesting that PIPAC can induce regression of resistant PMs in several cancer types and carries the potential to meet the clinical need for new and better therapies. Our results also provide evidence that low-dose PIPAC therapy might effectively treat patients with recurrent, chemo-resistant gastric PMs, including the poorly differentiated tubular type or poorly cohesive cancer.

The pivotal question is whether PIPAC delivered immediately after a laparoscopic D2 gastrectomy for GAC can reduce the risk of recurrent PM. Our institutions' recent phase I trial has shown this therapeutic concept to be feasible and safe. Hence, a randomised phase-II clinical trial must be conducted to assess the impact of PIPAC on disease-free survival in patients with high-risk GAC who are offered surgical treatment with curative intent.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-09,2028-01,2027-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,264,ESTIMATED

NCT02571894,The Cardio-Oncology Breast Cancer Study,"Effects of Identifying and Treating Early, Subclinical Cardiotoxicity on the Long-Term Incidence of Clinical Cardiotoxicity in Women With Breast Cancer, A Prospective Randomized Study: The Cardio-Oncology Breast Cancer Study (COBC)","The main objective of this randomized controlled trial is to test the association between standard cardiac risk factors, biomarkers and parameters of echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, (predictors) and subsequent occurrence, frequency and severity of clinical or subclinical cardiotoxicity (outcome) within and between-groups, before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years after the completion of the chemotherapy among women with early breast cancer.","Rationale for the study:

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Swedish women, accounting for a third of all cancer cases among females. The breast cancer incidence has increased from 2596 to more than 8000 breast cancer diagnosis 2011. During the past 40 years, the age-adjusted incidence has doubled. Early adjuvant therapy reduces the risk of dying with about 50%. (Early adjuvant therapies; chemotherapy, antibodies, endocrine therapy, and radiotherapy). Treatment advances have improved survival rates, but treatment-related cardiotoxicity (CT) remains a substantial problem.

In general, earlier treatment of cardiotoxicity offers the best chances of preventing or ameliorating clinical cardiotoxicity. Risk factors should be modified or reduced by treating elevated blood pressure, normalizing lipids, encouraging weight reduction and smoking cessation. Patient-tailored therapy is now possible, especially given the availability of different chemotherapy regimens, safer anthracycline analogs such as liposomal doxorubicin, and cardioprotective medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and b-blockers. It is now suggested that new cardiac biomarkers and ultrasound techniques can detect cardiotoxicity in its early, subclinical, stages. The investigators hypothesized that biomarkers can be used to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity and that detecting early signs of cardiotoxicity might reduce the number, time-to-onset, and severity of cardiotoxic events.

In present proposal the investigators aim in a randomized study to compare primary cardiac preventive measurements versus standard care.

Objectives of the trial:

1. Primary objective In a randomized study to investigate the cumulative incidence of cardiotoxic events, per randomized arm, before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years after the completion of the chemotherapy.
2. Secondary Objectives To compare the number, time-to-onset, and severity of cardiotoxic events in an experimental group assessed and treated for subclinical cardiotoxicity before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years after the completion of the chemotherapy and a control group receiving standard of care without early assessment for subclinical cardiotoxicity. Data on the same variables will be collected from both groups before start of chemotherapy, during treatment and at 1, 5, and 10 years. Data from the experimental group will be used in real time to guide therapy, but data from the control group will be not be analyzed until after the end of the study.

To assess subclinical cardiotoxicity with serum concentrations of biomarkers, tissue Doppler and strain echocardiography, electrocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging, as well as with standard cardiac risk assessment based on standard risk factors: a history of heart disease, increasing age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, parasternal radiotherapy, and the cumulative dose of anthracyclines and trastuzumab.

To assess the association between primary treatment of existing standard cardiac risk factors, biomarkers and parameters of echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, (predictors) and subsequent occurrence of clinical or subclinical cardiotoxicity of cardiotoxicity (outcome) within and between-groups, over time.

Thus, the investigators will study the effects of an inhospital exercise intervention combined with lifestyle--including diet--counselling along the duration of treatment (neoadjuvant \[solid tumours\]/intense chemotherapy \[leukaemias\], expected median duration 5-6 months) on several health-related variables.

Setting and Methods. Participants will be recruited from 4 hospitals in Madrid (Spain). Inclusion criteria: male/female aged 12-19 years, newly diagnosed with a malignant extracranial tumour; not having received any type of therapy--except surgery--at the time of diagnosis; adequate health status (Karnofsky/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale score ≥50/2); to understand Spanish language and to provide written informed consent. The investigators will recruit ≥136 participants and conduct a randomised controlled trial (1:1 ratio randomisation with a block on gender and tumour type \[leukaemias/lymphomas\]). In addition to usual care, the control group will be informed of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. The intervention group will follow a physical exercise and lifestyle counselling program. The exercise intervention will be performed in the hospital gymnasium (3 sessions/week of aerobic and resistance exercises), except for neutropenic phases--during which time sessions will be performed in the patients' ward--and will also include inspiratory muscle training (5 days/week). Health counselling will include a psychological intervention (1 session/week) based on motivational interviewing techniques, guidance by a nutritionist (2 sessions/month), and support sessions (1/month) with survivors (≥5-year survivorship) who will share their experiences with the study participants. The following outcomes will be assessed at baseline (diagnosis), end of treatment, and at 3-month follow-up in all participants: echocardiography-determined left ventricular function (primary outcome); and other echocardiographic variables, cardiometabolic biomarkers, blood pressure, blood lipids, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-determined body composition (fat \[including visceral adipose tissue\]/lean mass, bone mineral content/density), energy intake, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, functional mobility, health-related quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, clinical variables (survival, treatment tolerability, hospitalisation length), and potential biological underpinnings of exercise multisystemic benefits (cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, gut microbiome, and immune function \[lymphocyte subpopulations, natural killer cell cytotoxicity\]) (secondary outcomes).",RECRUITING,,2022-09-15,2026-12-31,2026-05-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,136,ESTIMATED

NCT04670094,Comorbidities and Risk Score in COVID-19 Patients,Comorbidities and Risk Score for Severity and Outcome in Patients With Infection by SARS-CoV-2.,Retrospective multi-center cohort study. Consecutive patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) up to October 2020 will be included. Patients are followed until discharge from hospital or death.,"Background

A virus causing clusters of severe pneumonia was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

This pathogen was designated as SARS-CoV-2. Although of probable zoonotic origin, human-to-human transmission has rapidly fuelled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally.

On February 20th, the first case of locally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in Northern Italy in a critically ill, hospitalized young man with no travel history to known areas of viral circulation or link to a probable or confirmed coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) case. Prior to this date, only three cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Central Italy, all with a travel history to Wuhan. Following this unexpected finding, case counts, and death tolls has increased rapidly in the country with a total of 192,994 confirmed cases and 25,969 deaths as of 24 April 2020.

Study rationale

Multiple variables have been described as possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, severity and prognosis, among which age, sex and comorbidities play an important role.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed the underlying medical conditions that have shown to increase the risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2. While some comorbidities, such as serious heart conditions and chronic kidney disease have a consistent and strong evidence as bad prognostic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection, others as HIV have a limited evidence and heterogeneous results.

Further, despite it is well-known that the burden of co-existing diseases may be additive or even multiplicative, the effect of specific disease cluster on COVID-19 adverse outcomes has never been evaluated. Finally, the proposed models and risk scores currently available to predict disease severity and mortality are poorly reported and at high risk of bias, raising concern that their predictions could be unreliable when applied in daily practice. A reliable risk/prognostic score developed by a multidimensional and cross-validated approach will pave the way for future research on frail sectors of the population and on the use of health system resources. At the clinical level, a prognostic score will allow to predict severity and mortality risk in patients requiring hospitalization and to stratify patients according to clinical severity helping clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making.

Objectives

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will confirm risk predictors already known and provide evidence for the uncertain ones. The investigators will also develop a prognostic score able to predict negative clinical outcomes (primarily short-term mortality), that will be useful to stratify patients at hospital admission according to their different risk profiles, and therefore to ""tailor"" the individuals' level of care.

A secondary objective could be that to extend this approach at the susceptible population level, especially the elders, to stratify according to the higher risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized and to have a dismal outcome (not developed here but related to a possible amendment).

Sample size

The investigators expect the total number of patients with complete data to be approximately 2500, based on the expected recruitment of each center.

Analysis Plan

Data will be summarized by counts and percentage and quartiles for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multi-state models will be used to describe patient's hospital mortality and discharge. In-hospital mortality will be estimate accounting for discharge as competing event. Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate mortality up to 3-months from admission. The role of patient's comorbidities on clinical outcome will be evaluated by the Cox model adjusting for relevant confounders. A clinically-based prognostic score will be developed including comorbidities and other risk factors. The score will be constructed by a multidimensional approach and Lasso approach will be used to select relevant risk factors. The Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) and Brier score will be used to evaluate model performance and the final score will be cross-validated. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a training and test validation approach. The use of regression trees for a practical definition of risk subgroups and latent variable models will also be considered.

Multiple imputation will be performed if missing would exceed 10%.

Data collection

Consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 up to October 2020 will be included. Given the difficulty in systematically obtaining written informed consent and given the great public interest of the project, the research will be conducted in the context of the authorizations guaranteed by Article 89 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU Regulation 2016/679, which guarantees processing for purposes of public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes of health data.",COMPLETED,,2020-12-30,2021-05-29,2021-05-29,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,4555,ACTUAL

The central hypothesis is that this community-informed prehab intervention will demonstrate feasibility, patient acceptability, and modulation of host and tumor-microenvironment inflammatory biomarkers.

Aim 1: Implement the prehab translational clinical trial for AI patients with obesity-related solid tumor cancer scheduled for surgery.

Aim 2 Measure host and tumor-microenvironment (TME) biomarkers using paired serum and tissue samples to compare baseline and post-intervention levels of expression. Serum markers include CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, IGF-1, VEGF, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and prealbumin. Tissue markers include Ki67, insulin receptor, TNFa, NFKB, NOS2, and cleaved caspase 3.

Aim 3: (optional exploratory aim): Assess differential expression of inflammatory genes in the TME using tumor tissue samples to compare baseline and post-intervention levels of expression. This will be done with a panel that analyzes inflammatory genes only.","The research entails a single-arm, pre-post, window-of-opportunity prehab intervention trial.

The prehab intervention is designed to modify inﬂammatory biomarkers in paired pre/post-intervention blood and tissue samples.

For the pilot intervention, 30 individuals who are 18-80 years old with a diagnosis of obesity-related solid tumor cancer, scheduled at least 3 weeks out from cancer surgery who receive care at SCAHC will be recruited over the duration of the study. Participants meeting criteria will be screened for eligibility. Those meeting eligibility criteria who are interested will be consented and enrolled. They will undergo baseline measurements that include medical/ family/cancer history and demographics, baseline anthropometric measures (blood pressure, weight, height, and waist circumference), completion of diet/exercise and health behavior questionnaires, 6-minute walk test, sit-to- stand test and blood samples which will be run for inﬂammatory biomarkers. The consent will include permission to obtain the diagnostic biopsy tissue for the purposes of this research study to measure tissue biomarkers.

After baseline evaluation, patients will receive diet and exercise counseling prior to commencing the prehab program. They will receive general nutritional guidance on healthy eating, walking, and instructed on the methods of self-monitoring their activity levels (pedometer, daily log, checklists). They will participate in twice weekly 60-minute training sessions supervised by certiﬁed fitness trainers and perform 30 minutes of walking daily on their own.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 155 patients (82 males, 73 females) who underwent robotic surgery for rectal cancer. Demographic, pre-operative, operative, and post-operative data were collected and analyzed.

Pre-operative study:

All patients underwent a standardized pre-operative work-up, which included a physical examination, comprehensive colonoscopy with biopsy, rigid rectoscopy, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and abdomen, and measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Tumor staging followed the TNM staging criteria (American Joint Committee on Cancer), with the T and N stages determined by the most advanced findings from any imaging modality

Data collected:

Retrospective evaluation and comparison of demographic characteristics, pre-operative TNM stage, distance from anal verge, tumor size, tumor grade, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and body mass index (BMI) were conducted among both patient groups. Peri-operative and post-operative data, including morbidity and mortality, were assessed, alongside parameters such as distal resection margin (DRM), proximal resection margin (PRM), harvested lymph nodes (HLN), and Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) scores. Diagnosis of anastomotic leakage was confirmed by clinical suspicion (e.g., changes in drainage, fever, abdominal pain) and further validated through contrast enema observed during follow-up computed tomography (CT). Hospital stay and readmission rates were monitored for up to 90 days post-surgery.

Post-operative follow-up:

Post-operative outcomes encompassed operative duration, estimated blood loss, time to first flatus passage, duration of liquid diet, and length of hospital stay following surgery. Operative duration comprised the time from initial skin incision to closure, including the time needed for robotic surgery docking and undocking. Upon experiencing initial flatulence, patients transitioned to a liquid diet. Hospital stay duration was measured from the time of surgery to discharge. The overall cost of surgery, including surgical procedures, anesthesia, medications, and post-operative care, was considered in the total expenditure analysis.",,COMPLETED,,2021-07-15,2024-04-15,2024-03-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,155,ACTUAL

Gene transfer involves drawing blood from the patient, and then separating out the T-cells using a machine. Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells' DNA, and then inject the changed T-cells into the body of the patient.

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an investigational type of gene transfer can be given reliably and safely in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoma. B cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection and disease. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, including B cells.

The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells (white blood cells that fight infection and disease), changing the T cells' DNA (genetic material) in a specific way, and returning the changed T cells back to the body.

Researchers want to learn the highest dose of the changed T cells that can be given safely. Researchers also want to learn how long the changed T cells remain in the participant's body, and if the changed T cells can reliably treat B-cell lymphoma. Finally, researchers want to learn if interleukin-2 (IL-2) can help the changed T cells last longer in the body.","Study Plan:

This study has 3 steps: chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, and gene transfer. If the disease relapses (returns) during the study, you may receive the T-cell infusion without having a stem cell transplant. Your study doctor will decide if you will receive the stem cell transplant or not.

The chemotherapy combination in this study (carmustine \[BiCNU®\], cytarabine \[Cytosar-U®\], etoposide \[Vepesid®\], and melphalan \[Alkeran®\] is given to try to destroy any remaining tumor cells and prepare the body for the stem cell transplant and/or T-cell infusion.

If you receive the T cells without transplant, you may receive additional chemotherapy before the T cell infusion, if your doctor thinks it is needed. Your treating doctor will discuss these chemotherapy drugs with you, and you may sign an additional consent for those chemotherapy drugs as standard of care.

A stem cell transplant is designed to help the body attack the cancer cells that may remain after chemotherapy.

The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells, changing the cells' DNA in the laboratory, and returning the genetically changed cells back to the body. T cells are a type of white blood cell that fight infection. The type of gene transfer being used in this study is designed to help your T cells better fight B-cell lymphoma. These genetically changed T cells are designed to fight B-cell lymphoma by targeting CD19 (a chemical ""marker"" that is found on certain B-cell lymphoma cells).

IL-2 (Proleukin®) is designed to help T cells grow. In this study, researchers want to learn if it can help the genetically changed T cells grow and last longer in the body.

Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of T cells, with or without IL-2, based on when you joined this study.

The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose of T cells. Each new group will receive a higher dose of T cells than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 4 dose combinations of T cells will be tested.

Tests Before Leukapheresis:

Before each of the 2 leukapheresis procedures (described below), the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and used for routine tests and to look for diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.
* To check your lung function, you will have breathing tests. A chest X-ray will be performed to check for infection.

Leukapheresis #1 or Standard Blood Draw (For Collecting T Cells) You will visit the Apheresis Clinic at MD Anderson to have leukapheresis performed. Leukapheresis is a procedure for removing blood from the body in order to collect specific blood cells. The remaining blood is then returned to the body.

Blood will be drawn through a needle in a vein in one arm, then passed through a machine, and then the remaining blood will be returned back to you through a needle in a vein in your other arm. The machine will remove a sample of your white blood cells. This process will take about 3 hours to complete.

Blood may also be collected through a standard blood draw. Blood (less than 7 tablespoons) containing circulating T cells will be drawn over 1-2 days using one or more needle sticks in your arm.

Your white blood cell sample will be sent to a lab at MD Anderson so the genetically modified T cell product can be made. The modified T cells will be grown in the lab.

It will take about 7 weeks to modify and grow the necessary number of genetically modified T cells. If researchers are unable to create a high enough dose of T cells for you in the lab, you will be taken off study.

Placement of Central Venous Catheter:

Before the second leukapheresis, you will receive a central venous catheter. This is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein in your upper chest, while you are under local anesthesia. The study investigator will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for it.

When possible, all drugs that need to be given by vein will be given using the catheter. You will also receive the T cell product through the catheter.

Leukapheresis #2 (For Collecting Stem Cells) only in patients receiving a stem cell transplant:

About a month after your first leukapheresis, you will return to have the procedure repeated a second time. This time, the blood cells collected will be a sample of blood-forming stem cells. The stem cells will be given back to you after your chemotherapy. If a high enough number of stem cells cannot be collected, however, you will be taken off study.

A stem cell transplant is part of this study's treatment plan, but in some cases, participants in this study will have their stem cells collected as part of another research study or for routine care.

Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant:

After your stem cells have been successfully collected, you will be admitted to the hospital to receive chemotherapy. You will stay in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks.

* On Day 1, you will receive carmustine by vein over 1 hour.
* Every 12 hours on Days 2-5, you will receive cytarabine by vein over 1 hour and etoposide by vein over 3 hours.
* On Day 6, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.
* On Day 7, the stem cells that were collected earlier will be given back to you (""transplanted"") by vein over 30-45 minutes. Day 7 is also called Day 0, since it is the day of the transplant. The days after the transplant are called Days +1, +2, and so on.

After the stem cell transplant, the study investigator will decide if you are still eligible to receive the T cell infusion (and IL-2, if you are assigned to receive it). If you have any infections or intolerable side effects, or if you are taking certain types of steroids by mouth or injection, you will be taken off study. If you do not receive the T cell infusions, you would not need to return for the follow-up described below.

If you have had prior involvement of disease in your brain/spine area, your physician may give you a different chemotherapy regimen consisting of the following:

* On Day 1, you will receive carmustine by vein over 1 hour.
* Every 12 hours on Days 2-3, you will receive thiotepa by vein over 1 hour
* On Day 7, the stem cells that were collected earlier will be given back to you (""transplanted"") by vein over 30-45 minutes. Day 7 is also called Day 0, since it is the day of the transplant. The days after the transplant are called Days +1, +2, and so on.

T Cell Infusion (Gene Transfer):

You will receive the T cell infusion sometime between Day +2 through Day +7. (The exact day will be as soon as you are eligible.) The T cell infusion will be given by vein over 15-30 minutes. The infusion may be divided into two parts at least 24 hours apart. The first part of the infusion will be a much smaller part to ensure that you have no immediate side effects. During the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.

Alternatively, your doctor may decide that it is better for you to receive the infusion on one day by vein over 15-30 minutes. During the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.

Before the T cell infusion, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to the T cells. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) will be given by mouth, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) will be given by vein over a few minutes.

IL-2 Administration:

If you are in Group 2 or 4, IL-2 will be injected under the skin, once a day for up to 14 days. The first dose will be on the day of your T cell infusion.

Before each IL-2 injection, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to the IL-2. Acetaminophen will be given by mouth. Diphenhydramine will be given by mouth or by vein over a few minutes.

Study Tests:

Every day while you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

On the day of the T-cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.
* You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.
* Your medical history will be recorded.
* Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

Within 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the T cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.
* Your medical history will be recorded.

At 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months (+/-5 days), blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for research to look for the modified T cells and to measure the number of B cells and other (non-modified) T cells. Like T cells, B cells are part of your immune system.

Follow-Up:

At about 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after the stem cell transplant, you will return for follow-up visits. At each visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.
* Your medical history will be recorded.
* Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for research to look for the modified T cells and to measure the number of B cells and other T cells. Part of the blood sample at 12 months will be tested for HAMA.
* Other tests to check your health may also be performed if needed, such as CT scans, PET/CT scans, and/or bone marrow aspirations and biopsies.

If the disease comes back or a side effect occurs during the 12 months after the stem cell transplant, you may be asked to return for additional follow-up visits as needed.

Length of Study Participation:

If you have any infections or intolerable side effects, you will be taken off study early.

If you complete the study as planned, you will be off-study after your last follow-up visit.

Request for Autopsy:

In the event of death due to any cause, an autopsy will be requested from your family if it is possible.

Long-Term Follow-Up:

For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires patients receiving gene transfer to have long-term follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for long-term follow up. That study is known as Protocol 2006-0676, and the follow-up will begin 1 year after the gene transfer study.

This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy and stem cell transplant in this study are commercially available and FDA approved. The gene transfer is not commercially available or FDA approved. At this time, gene transfer is only being used in research.

Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",COMPLETED,,2011-06-20,2020-04-23,2020-04-23,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,34,ACTUAL
NCT04385160,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) and COVID-19,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) and COVID-19,"An increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolism was noted in reports from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in China and has been confirmed in autopsy findings from patients who experienced sudden death. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), which encompass polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, are thrombophilic disorders with a natural propensity to thrombosis that is fuelled by the intrinsic activation of inflammatory cytokines. It therefore follows that an underlying diagnosis of MPN may increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes and death during periods of active Covid-19 disease. This ambispective, observational study aims to elucidate the key factors which affect the clinical course of patients with MPN who develop Covid-19 disease.","This is an European multicenter observational study that will include around 550 MPN patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 will be followed for at least one month. Detailed information on the clinical characteristics of these patients and their disease outcomes will be retrospectively and prospectively collected in a specific eCRF, including MPN characteristics, treatment and comorbidities pre-Covid-19, time of Covid-19 diagnosis, drugs/device used for the treatment of Covid-19, any change in MPN therapy, antithrombotic prophylaxis employed during the period of infection and - for hospitalised patients only - key blood and laboratory parameters. A particular focus will be on exploring final outcomes for patients in this study, most notably the incidence of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events. Statistical analyses will also be performed looking for any independent factors that can significantly predict patient outcomes after Covid-19 diagnosis.

Ultimately, this project will provide important insights into disease severity and progression in patients with MPN and Covid-19 and uncover the key clinical factors which drive outcomes and mortality. Results may help clinicians better understand how patient characteristics and management decisions can impact on disease trajectory when MPN and Covid-19 collide.",UNKNOWN,,2020-05-13,2022-08-31,2022-02-15,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,552,ESTIMATED

Women who exercise regularly and who have lower levels of blood sugar and metabolic hormones like insulin have a lower risk of developing breast cancer. Some evidence also suggests that exercise and metabolism are related to cancer recurrence in women who are diagnosed with breast cancers that can be removed with surgery, but less is known about how exercise and metabolic factors are related to cancer progression in women whose cancer has advanced beyond the breast and underarm lymph nodes. This study is designed to look at the effects of exercise combined with prolonged nightly fasting (having a longer time between dinner and breakfast the next day), on blood sugar and hormones that control metabolism. This study looks to provide important information about whether making these kinds of changes is possible for women living with advanced breast cancer and will explore how making these changes effects blood sugar and hormone levels in women taking different kinds of treatments for advanced breast cancer.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, a baseline visit to collect information about diet and exercise habits, a baseline blood draw, participation in a 12-week diet and exercise program, and a follow up visit and blood collection at the end of the diet and exercise program.

Participants will be in this research study for up to 14-weeks, including the baseline and end of study visits to collect study measures.

Eligible subjects with NMIBC will be recruited to the trial following the initial diagnostic cystoscopy. During the diagnostic cystoscopy, the number of tumor lesions, their size and location will be documented and recorded with video or photo cystoscopy.

A baseline cystoscopy will be conducted in all subjects for the evaluation of number of tumors and their diameters, and for mapping of their location. Baseline blood samples for liver and renal functions, as well as for complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation tests will be drawn prior to instillation to ensure eligibility and to serve as a reference point for systemic safety follow-up.

A future TURBT has been planned for 8-10 weeks post screening. Enrolled subjects will be treated successively with 40mg MMC in 40 mL TC-3 (the first 6 subjects) and with 80 mg MMC in 40 mL TC-3 (the following 12 subjects). At treatment session initiation, an 18-20 Fr two-way catheter will be inserted into the subject's bladder in order to completely empty the bladder of urine. Thereafter, a volume of 40 mL of cooled TC-3 mixed with 40 mg or 80 mg of MMC will be instilled through the catheter into the bladder of the subject. The catheter will then be ligated for twenty minutes, after which it will be drawn out of the bladder and the subject was will be allowed to urinate freely.

The subjects will undergo six weekly bladder instillations according to their assigned treatment of either 40 mg MMC (Group A) or 80 mg MMC (Group B) in 40 mL of TC-3. Following completion of instillation treatment series, there will be a 2-4 weeks healing period prior to next follow up visit (overall 10-12 weeks post screening). During 2-4 weeks follow-up (FU) visit, the lesions' status will be examined under cystoscopy. For subjects who will appear to have complete response (CR), this will be confirmed based on histological results. For subjects that will not be classified as having CR, decision about performance of TURBT or giving additional treatment will be at the PI's discretion.

Following 2-4 week FU visit, subjects will be managed according to their local standard guidelines. All patients will attempt to be followed up for 12 months following 2-4 weeks FU within the trial. These visits will be documented and data regarding recurrence and progression will be collected.

Background

1. Petersen's hernia after gastrectomy Petersen's hernia was reported in 1900 by German surgeon Walther Petersen following the occurrence of an internal hernia after gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy (G-J) 1\[\]. Petersen's hernia occurs in the free space posterior to a G-J site after any type of G-J and is caused by herniation of the small bowel through the defect between the small bowel mesentery and the transverse mesocolon.

   As shown in CT figure in Figure 1, the small bowel mesentery rotates and twists, leading to an emergency situation in which necrosis of the entire small intestine occurs due to decreased blood circulation of the small intestine The occurrence rate of Petersen's hernias after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y G-J is approximately 1.7\~9.7%

   - Peterson's hernia can occur in the RNY esophagojejunal anastomosis after gastrectomy, or after the RNY gastrojejunostomy and Billroth type 2 anastomosis after distal gastrectomy. Also, it can occur after the obesity surgery RNY gastric bypass surgery.
2. The incidence of internal hernia has been reported to be higher in laparoscopic approaches than in open gastrectomy One possible cause of the increasing incidence of Petersen's hernias is the recent development of minimally invasive surgery. A higher incidence of internal hernia is reported in minimally invasive gastrectomy than in open gastrectomy.

   After open surgery, adhesion was made between the small bowel and the operative wound site, however with minimally invasive surgery, adhesion is remarkably decreased, not only because of the disappearance of the open wound in the upper abdomen but also the use of antiadhesive agent Therefore, non-absorbable sutures require the closure of Peterson's spaces, and according to report of Blockhuys M, the frequency of internal hernia decreased after closure of Petersen's space.

   The frequency of internal hernia significantly decreases when Peterson space closure is implemented compared to the group that performed mesentery defect closure only.
3. The problem of Petersen's space closure procedure The closure of the defect at Petersen's space can induce bleeding by injuring the mesenteric vessels, as well as small bowel ischemia, caused by injuring the peripheral mesenteric vessels near the small bowel lumen. It has also been reported that early postoperative obstruction could be due to jejunal kinking of the closing site of the mesenteric defect. The closure of mesenteric defects increased the risk for severe postoperative complications in the early postoperative phase (\<30 days) following the closure, mainly because of kinking of the jejunostomy site. We also encountered kinking of the jejunojejunostomy in the early postoperative periods after gastrectomy. However, it is not easy to determine if the complications are because of kinking of the entero-entero anastomosis or the adhesion effect from the closure of Petersen's space. Peterson space closure is necessary, but it is difficult by technical problem to develop an easy method.
4. Previous study We conducted jejunal mesentery fixing (Mefix) to the transverse mesocolon with a non-absorbable suture to prevent of a Petersen's hernia.

The theory of the Mefix method is as follows. When the mesentery of the small intestine is fixed to the transverse mesocolon between the small bowel and the colon mesentery, the defect still remains. However, the small bowel does not enter the defect because the small bowel mesentery is fixed at the transverse mesocolon; consequently, a Petersen's hernia does not occur.

MEFIX method allowed partial herniation of bowel, but it prevent of total herniation. This prevent bowel infarction

We closed Petersen's space defect between March 1st, 2016 and Dec 31th, 2017 (N=49), and we performed the Mefix procedure between July 1st, 2017 and June 30th, 2018 (N=26). We classified patients into the Petersen's space closure group (closure group) and the mesentery fixing group (Mefix group). All patients visited the hospital at six months and one year after surgery, and a CT scan was performed to check for the recurrence of gastric cancer. We determined the incidence of Petersen's hernia by abdominal CT scan, and we found no incidence of Petersen's hernias in either group. The procedure times for mesentery fixing (3.7 ± 1.1 minutes) were significantly shorter than those for Petersen's space closures (7.5 ± 1.5 minutes) (p\<0.001). However, a retrospective study and a small group of patients seem to require a large, prospective random study.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2022-04-01,2029-01-26,2027-01-26,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,444,ESTIMATED

NCT01432860,A Comparison of Interventions to Teach Melanoma Patients Skin Self-examination,A Comparison of Interventions to Teach Melanoma Patients Skin Self-examination,"The almost 724,000 Americans survivors of melanoma are estimated to have 4 first degree relatives per case; thus, 2.8 million Americans are at increased risk of developing melanoma in comparison to the general public. Skin self-examination (SSE) with the assistance of a partner by these individuals could improve survival. If effective, the workbook tested in this proposal could be distributed to people at risk of developing melanoma by large scale means in physicians office.","Population based registries document that survival from melanoma, a growing public health problem with approximately 70,000 new melanoma cases and an estimated 8,600 deaths in 2010, is dependent on the thickness of the melanoma. By facilitating seeking medical care, skin self-examinations (SSEs) by individuals with a prior history of melanoma, who are at risk to develop subsequent melanomas, may lead to the early detection and treatment of melanoma when it is usually more effective. Thus, further research that enhances early detection is warranted and our application directly tests novel methods of training high-risk melanoma patients and their partners on how to conduct SSEs to promote early detection. Our proposed research builds upon the strengths of the R21 that: a) established that in-person training to conduct SSE with a partner significantly enhanced SSE performance 4 months after the intervention, and b) developed and pilot tested a manualized take-home workbook training approach (WORKBOOK). Our pilot work on the WORKBOOK with partners suggests that patient-partner dyads (n = 21) perceived it to be readable, useful, and in the short term 4 month follow-up, empirically equivalent in promoting SSE knowledge, skills, and behaviors compared with patient-partner dyads in the in-person partner training condition (n = 19). Our proposed research builds on our NCI funded studies by conducting a formal examination with 430 pairs (860 subjects) randomized to either the in-person or workbook training vs. an assessment only control group that receives standard of care over a 2 year longitudinal study with 4 month interval evaluations. An additional group of 70 pairs (140 subjects) has been added to test a tablet computer-based program.

Our proposed research directly tests novel methods of training Stage I and IIB melanoma patients, who have a 5 year survival of 80-90%, and their partners, on how to conduct SSEs. We will compare the efficacy of the in-person training vs. workbook for patients and partners vs. controls on SSE knowledge/skill acquisition and retention, and SSE performance and accuracy on a short (4 and 8 months post baseline) and long term basis (12, 16, 20, and 24 months post baseline) and examine whether partner-patient relationship-qualities moderate the relationship between the training approaches and SSEs knowledge/skill acquisition and retention, and SSE performance and accuracy. The tablet computer-based program will also be tested for efficacy and compared with the previous groups.

Establishing health promotion partnerships is important to those at risk to develop melanoma because SSE is difficult to successfully perform as an individual. It is expected that the workbook will promote SSE at least as well as and perhaps better than in-person training and become an easily disseminated SSE training approach that is not dependent on the time and teaching skills of the non-MD clinical office staff.",COMPLETED,,2011-09,2015-05,2015-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,SCREENING,1000,ACTUAL

Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy in different ways and combining it with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Celecoxib may slow the growth of cervical cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus celecoxib, fluorouracil, and cisplatin in treating patients who have locally advanced cervical cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine treatment-related toxicity rates in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy concurrently with celecoxib, fluorouracil, and cisplatin.
* Determine whether this regimen increases locoregional control rates, distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival in these patients.
* Determine whether first-failure patterns in patients treated with this regimen are changed compared to historical controls.

Many people receive treatments called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies for their breast cancer, however these can affect heart function. This 'cardiotoxicity' is generally temporary and mild, but patients receive drugs to help their heart recover. Currently it is not known how long patients should receive these treatments. Patients with other types of heart failure are treated lifelong, but this may not be necessary here as the damaging cancer drugs have stopped. Taking drugs for many years can have an impact on people's quality of life, particularly for young patients. It is therefore important to understand the best treatment length. The investigators will study people whose heart function has recovered after HER2 therapy heart problems and are not at high risk for heart disease. The investigators will carefully stop their heart drugs whilst monitoring them closely with special heart scans and blood tests to detect problems early. The investigators will also study how patients are currently treated using national data. The results of this study will help doctors better guide breast cancer survivors about treatment of heart damage from HER2 cancer therapies.","Trial design: Two centre open label randomised control trial to evaluate the phased withdrawal versus continuation of heart failure treatment for 'recovered' human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy-related cardiac dysfunction in non-high risk patients following completion of HER2 therapy. The trial will include cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans (CMR) with automated in-line analytics to improve the sensitivity for detection of early relapse, and detailed patient questionnaires assessing medication disutility to better understand participant motivations and concerns related to treatment continuation and withdrawal.

Trial population: The trial will recruit 90 adult participants (\>18 years) with a prior diagnosis of HER2-targeted therapy related cardiac dysfunction, who currently receive standard heart failure/ cardioprotective medications (any combination of Angiotensin-converting enzyme \[ACE\] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers \[ARBs\] and/or beta-blockers), and whose cardiac function has 'recovered'. 'Recovery' is defined as absence of heart failure symptoms with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved to 50% or greater and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) \<200ng/L, for greater than 6 months. Patients will be recruited from Barts Health and University College London Hospitals (UCLH) cardio-oncology and breast cancer clinics. Exclusion criteria: Patients with advanced/ metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer requiring ongoing HER2 therapies or with life expectancy \<12months will be excluded. Patients classed as high/very high cardiotoxicity risk according to the European Society of Cardiology/International Cardio-Oncology Society Position Statement (Lyon et al, 2020), LVEF \<50% prior to HER2-therapies or on completion of anthracycline treatment, or indications for ongoing ACE inhibitors, ARBs and/or beta-blockers, nor those with absolute contraindications to CMR.

Interventions and Duration of treatment: Participants will undergo phased withdrawal of heart failure/ cardioprotective treatments according to a pre-specified algorithm based on the 'Withdrawal of pharmacological treatment for heart failure in patients with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy' (TRED-HF) study protocol (Halliday et al 2019). This had been designed following extensive consultation with independent experts and attempts to mimic 'real-world' medication withdrawal in clinical practice.

NCT02930876,Feasibility of Home vs. Hospital Based Resistance Training for Advanced Cancer Patients,Feasibility of Home vs. Hospital Based Resistance Training for Advanced Cancer Patients: a Phase II Trial,"Cancer causes 8.2 million deaths each year, with an estimated worldwide cost of $895 billion. Pharmacological treatments provide improvements in expected survival and symptoms, but at cost of a high rate of toxicities and increased time spent by patients away from their homes and families during treatment. This is particularly important for patients with advanced disease as the timeframe at stake relates to their last months of life.

Sarcopenia (i.e. loss of muscle mass together with decreased functional capacity) has been widely reported as an important prognostic factor in advanced cancer, with impact on survival, toxicities, response to treatment and other patient-centered outcomes (such as functional capacity, quality of life and fatigue).

Sarcopenia is a term first used in 1988 by Rosenberg, meaning an age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass and function. It was derived from the greek: sarx = flesh and penia = loss. In 2010, a European Consensus defined sarcopenia as a triad of muscle mass loss, decreased functional performance and muscle strength. It has been reported as a hallmark of cancer, with impact on prognosis, response to treatments, side effects of chemotherapy and recovery after surgery. The prevalence of sarcopenia in advanced cancer seems to vary according to gender, stage, primary tumor location and treatments, being present in about 28 to 67% of patients.

Exercise, in particular resistance training, is one of the most powerful ways of increasing muscle mass and evidence from elderly patients suggests that it is among the most promising interventions for sarcopenia. There is evidence that resistance training can be effective but evidence is still scarce for patients with advanced disease. Historically there have been some concerns regarding safety and efficacy for oncologic patients, and though evidence suggests that resistance training is one of the most preferred forms of exercise by patients, the effectiveness of resistance training alone on sarcopenia in patients with advanced cancer remains unknown.

NCT05289076,Evaluation of Tumour Growth and Oncological Treatment in Patients With CRLM Using Zebra Fish Embryo Model,Protocol for Evaluation of Oncological Treatment in Patients With CRLM Using Zebra Fish Avatars-may This Model Improve Resection Rates and Survival in Patients With Upfront Non-resectable Metastatic Disease?,"In order to improve and individualize cancer treatment, personalized treatment needs to be developed much further. Liver metastasizing colorectal cancer is treated with a combination of oncological and surgical interventions. The selection of chemotherapy is today mainly done according to best guess. Today only a small fraction of oncological treatment may be known to be effective in a person before treatment start, most often it is trial and error. A fast reliable system for looking at response to different treatments in each unique patient is much needed and would, if successful, completely change the way we give oncological treatment today. Patient's tumor tissue will be evaluated with use of zebrafish embryo avatars to evaluate tumour growth and response to different combinations of chemotherapy. If successful interventional studies are planned.","The possibilities to predict oncological tumor response for individual patients with GI malignancies in order to tailor a personalized oncological treatment, are currently limited. This means that most of the information used to decide upon oncological treatment pertains to a group of patients rather than individuals. Similarly, most of the chemotherapy regimens used is not individually tailored although it has been shown to be beneficial for certain cohorts of patients. In colorectal cancer, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma) and BRAF mutation status predict the response to drugs targeting various steps in the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF signaling pathway, whereas MSI/MMR status may predict the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitors \[1\]. As chemotherapy, as well as other cancer treatments, may have severe side effects the treatment may not only be ineffective but may also cause severe adverse events even shortening the patient's life and inhibit the chance of curative tumor resection. For this reason, pre-treatment response evaluation in an avatar model of zebrafish, would be most valuable.

From a clinical point of view the easiest situation is in the adjuvant setting. At this point the whole tumor is available for analysis and larger pieces of tissues may be used in the avatar model. 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine (a 5-FU prodrug) either alone or in combination with oxaliplatin is the current standard adjuvant treatment in stage III colon cancer and stage II colon cancers with 2+ risk factors. Other types of combination regimens including e.g. irinotecan have so far failed to show benefit in the adjuvant situation.

In the neoadjuvant setting, i.e. preoperative treatment to patients with resectable CRLM, combinations of 5-FU (or capecitabine) and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan may improve the outcome of surgery and long term prognosis. It is currently not known which regimen is most efficient for the individual patient.

In the most severe scenario, where the patient presents with unresectable CRLM, either palliative chemotherapy or downsizing/conversion chemotherapy is indicated. For the latter group of patients, it is of uttermost importance to provide as potent treatment as possible in the first line, as the 10

The therapeutic window is narrow and further clinical and/or radiological progression on the first line therapy may preclude further oncological and surgical interventions. Fit patients may benefit from a triplet of 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI). However, this is a toxic regimen, and older or less fit patients are more commonly offered a doublet of 5-FU and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan. There may be an additional value when the chemotherapy is combined with antibodies targeting VEGF or, for those tumors expressing wild type KRAS, the EGF receptor.

But maybe the most valuable setting for the patient with upfront non-resectable tumor burden, would be before any treatment has started.

Up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop liver metastases either synchronous or metachronous in relation to the detection of the primary tumor\[2\]. The mainstay of treatment today is a combination of resection +/-ablation of metastases, with or without preoperative liver volume augmentation and chemotherapy sometimes in combination with antibodies\[3\].

A number of negative prognostic factors have been identified both regarding the tumor growth but also in the pattern of oncogens in the tumors\[4\]. Still, one of the most important factors is the response of the metastases to chemotherapy both radiologically but also in reduction of tumor markers (CEA, CA19/9)\[5, 6\].

Still we have very little knowledge if the metastases are going to respond to the therapy given or not. Tumor with KRAS mutation will not respond to Erbitux treatment, and mucinous tumors are usually more resistant to any chemotherapy\[7\].

Different models have been explored to evaluate tumor specific response to treatment, but most are slow or have shown mixed results\[8\]. Today, mouse patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model is the most used and validated to predict response to therapy, but evaluation of oncological therapy takes months \[9\]. Therefore, the mouse PDX model cannot be used for clinical decision-making. Organoid cultures using patient-derived cancers is a well-used in vitro screening tool, with promising results for different tumors\[10\]. Organoids maintain the genetic characteristics of the original tumor tissue. Still, these models are slow when it comes to evaluating patients' tissue for treatment decisions and lacks the ability to evaluate metastatic or angiogenic potentials.

Recently zebrafish embryos have been used as avatars for human cancer, first in hematogenous cancers but lately also in solid cancers like PDAC, breast cancer and colorectal cancer\[11-14\].

The model has several advantages, the strongest is response evaluation only 3-5 days after the tumor tissue is implanted in the embryos. The embryos are transparent so tumor growth and spread can be visualized in detail and quantified in a semi-automatic manner\[15\]. As the zebra fish embryos own immune system does not respond until day 8 days \[14\], why the immune response against the tumor comes from the patient's own immune cells, this is also the reason why xenograft engraftment works in this model. On the other hand. So far, biopsy tissue is not enough, but at least a cubic centimetre of tumor tissue is needed to generate these avatars. For this reason, needle biopsies are not providing enough material but resected liver tumor tissues are needed in the current protocols.

In zebrafish embryos, colorectal cancer cells have been shown to grow and response evaluation of different chemotherapy combinations have been successful with very good correlation to the response in humans\[14\]. Clinical studies on colorectal liver metastases have so far not been performed.

Fish are housed at an average temperature of 28 °C in a recirculating system with a 14:10 h light to dark cycle. Zebrafish fertilized eggs are obtained by natural mating of wild-type AB strain at our facilities and the developing embryos are staged in incubator at 28 °C according to Kimmel et al\[19\]. Before any procedure, embryos will be anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine. The tumor tissue taken from the surgical specimen by the histopathologist is cryopreserved by submerging the tissue in cryotubes containing cryopreservation medium, adding the tubes to a cryobox and placing the box in a -80 degrees freezer for at least 24 hours. The tube with tissue is then transported on dry ice to the zebrafish laboratory where the tissue will be thawed, washed and incubated in a protease mix within a mechanical disaggregation device (GentleMACS), to produce a single cell suspension from the tissue. The suspension is filtered and incubated for 30 min in 40 μg/mL CM-Dil in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by centrifugation, and washing with PBS. The labeled cells are then resuspended in implantation medium and injected using thin glass capillary needles into the subcutaneous perivitelline compartment of 2-days old zebrafish embryos. Successfully implanted zebrafish embryos are then transferred to embryo medium containing the drugs under investigation (e.g. the drugs that could be considered for treatment of the patient donating the sample) and treated for three days. Images of the tumors are acquired both immediately after transplantation and following the three-day treatment period, and an additional image of the main metastatic site in the zebrafish embryo is acquired after the three-day treatment period to evaluate the metastatic capabilities of the cells. Treatment outcome will be evaluated as change in tumor volume between day 3 and day 0 in the treatment group compared to the vehicle control group (percent), and a significantly stronger reduction of tumor volumes in the treatment group will be considered as a positive treatment outcome. Evidence of a pro-metastatic phenotype will be derived from the number of cells found at the metastatic site in the zebrafish embryos three days after implantation. Cut-off levels for how many metastasized cells are required to predict likely metastatic progression in the patient will be evaluated in the first 10-20 patients included as such information is not currently available from other sources of information.",RECRUITING,,2022-05-17,2025-03-14,2024-03-14,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,40,ESTIMATED

Tertiary objectives:

Evaluation of the influence of this approach on the up-staging of the patients

Microscopic study of the ICG distribution in the lymph nodes (in the lymphatic sinuses, in specific cells, in cancerous foci...)

Methodology:

In the operating room:

Patients will undergo standard surgical resection. Immediately after removal of the colon and node-bearing mesentery, using different 29 Gauge insulin syringes, blue dye (2 ml blue dye: 0.5 ml per injection) and ICG (2 ml with 0,5 mg ICG per ml: 0.5 ml per injection) will be injected in the fresh specimen beside each other submucosally around the tumour in at least four sites (as many injections needed to cover all the perimeter of the tumour) for each agent. The injection sites will be then gently stretched and massaged for 3-5 min to stimulate the tracers to flow along the lymphatic channels. Fluoroscopic imagings of the mesentery will be performed during the injections and during these manoeuvers.

The research and identification of the sentinel lymph nodes will be then performed as follows:

1. he will first localize the blue colored lymph vessels (if visible) as well as the palpable and/or blue colored lymph nodes. These last ones will be marked for dissection with a blue suture.
2. using the PDE camera, he will thereafter localize the fluorescent lymph vessels (if visible) as well as the palpable and/or fluorescent lymph nodes. These last ones will be marked for dissection with a green suture.

Histopathology in the Laboratory of Pathology:

When all SLN are identified, they will be dissected and classified as follows:

* SLN first seen as blue and confirmed also as fluorescent using PDE
* SLN seen as blue but not confirmed to be fluorescent using PDE
* SLN not directly visible as blue but seen fluorescent using PDE (the LN in this group will be controlled for their blue or not character when dissected)
* LN identified by the pathologist as pathological but not blue and not fluorescent.

After the dissection of these SLN, the specimen will be processed as usual using routine procedure for further examination of the non SLN by the pathologists. Once these lymph nodes are dissected, they will be tested for the emitted fluorescence.",COMPLETED,,2013-01,2015-02,2013-02,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,20,ACTUAL

Twelve evaluable participants with advanced solid tumors will be assessed. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APN401 and to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of APN401. The secondary objective is to collect preliminary data on the clinical efficacy of APN401.

Participants will receive up to four APN401 treatments via intravenous infusion at 3-weekly intervals. Participants, who have completed four treatment cycles and a safety follow-up, will be contacted by telephone to evaluate survival status at 6 and 12 months after start of treatment.","APN401 is a suspension of autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), transiently transfected with an siRNA to reduce Cbl-b protein levels. The administration of autologous Cbl-b silenced PBMCs to the patient will promote activation of both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms targeting tumor cells; along these lines APN401 is assumed to demonstrate significant improvement in cancer immune therapy. In addition, silencing of Cbl-b in the context of cellular therapeutics has potential to reduce mortality rates for patients with advanced cancers.

This is an open-label, single-arm trial to be conducted with up to twelve patients at four hospitals in Austria, Europe. Two dose levels of APN401 are evaluated using a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) study design with accelerated titration:

* Dose Level/Cohort 1: 1.5x10\^7 PBMCs/kg
* Dose Level/Cohort 2: 4.5x10\^7 PBMCs/kg

Dose escalation requires at least one patient to be treated and observed for at least three weeks after the first dose. The BOIN method will be used to guide the dose level assignment and estimate the MTD/RP2D based on cumulative information on DLTs in Cycle 1 of treatment (i.e. 3 weeks after first dose).

Patients with advanced solid tumors first undergo screening procedures during a 28-day time window between giving consent and starting APN401 treatment.

Endometrial cancer (EC) of the uterus is becoming more common in the US. Sometimes EC often has increased levels of a protein called HER2. Cancers with HER2 tend to be more aggressive and have poorer outcomes.

Objective:

To test 2 study drugs-a vaccine that targets HER2 (AdHER2DC) plus a drug that supercharges immune cells that kill tumor cells (N-803)-combined with 2 FDA-approved cancer treatment drugs in people with EC.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 and older with HER2-positive EC that returned or got worse after treatment.

Design:

AdHER2DC vaccine is made from each participant s own blood. Participants will undergo apheresis: Blood is removed from the body through a tube attached to a needle. The blood passes through a machine that separates out the target cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body through a second needle. A special catheter may be needed.

The first treatment cycle is 28 days; each cycle after that will be 21 days.

All participants will get the 2 approved drugs and the vaccine. One drug is a tablet taken by mouth once a day, every day. The other drug is given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein.

The vaccine is injected under the skin. Participants will receive the vaccine on day 1 of cycles 1, 2, and 3. Additional doses up to 3 doses will be give if possible.

Some participants will receive N-803. This drug is injected under the skin of the abdomen on day 1 of each cycle.

Treatment may last up to 1 year. Follow-up visits will continue up to 2 more years.","BACKGROUND:

* Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic cancer in the US and the incidence peaks around 50-60 years of age. 5-year overall survival in patients with metastasis is around 20 percent and treatment after the second-line treatment has not been effective for long-term control.
* Pembrolizumab is approved for microsatellite instability (MSI)-high endometrial cancer which is rare.
* Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic EC showed promising antitumor activity. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with advanced endometrial cancer who received prior chemotherapy after decades of lapse in adding new treatment options with an improved progression free survival (PFS) 6.6 months (vs 3.8 months in standard care chemotherapy), overall response rate 30 percent and median duration of response of 9.2 months.
* HER2 is positive in 30 percent of endometrial cancer and anti-HER2 therapy has shown clinical benefit in metastatic EC. Trastuzumab is used off-label with chemotherapy and as maintenance.
* An autologous dendritic cell vaccine that is transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of HER2 (AdHER2DC vaccine) was well tolerated and showed a preliminary clinical benefit of 33.3 percent among 21 evaluable patients (NCT01730118, total enrolled n=33). No cardiotoxicity was noted. Immunogenicity analysis in a limited number of patients suggested induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses.
* The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in EC showed antitumor activity with manageable toxicity but still showed the responses in a limited group of patients. To overcome the resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, the combination regimen to induce the antitumor immune response by the AdHER2 vaccine, control the negative immune regulators and hostile tumor microenvironment by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor lenvatinib, and an immune stimulatory cytokine IL-15 superagonist N-803 has the potential to make the tumor more responsive to the immunotherapy creating mutual synergy.

OBJECTIVES:

* Phase I: To estimate recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, N-803, and AdHER2DC vaccine in participants with HER2 positive endometrial cancer
* Phase II: To preliminarily assess the efficacy of a combination of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, N-803, and AdHER2DC vaccine in participants with HER2 positive endometrial cancer as determined by the proportion of participants without progression at 6 months

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

* Age \>=18 years.
* Metastatic or locally advanced endometrial cancer with HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+, 2+ or 3+.
* Progressed after at least 1 line of standard of care (SOC) systemic therapy Participants may have received any number of prior cytotoxic agents.
* ECOG performance status \<=2 and adequate organ function.

DESIGN:

* An open-label, two-arm, phase I/II study of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib, N-803, and AdHER2.
* During Phase I, we will estimate recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the lenvatinib in combination with AdHER2DC vaccine, pembrolizumab, and N-803.
* During Phase II we will continue to evaluate the safety and examine the efficacy of the study regimen at the RP2D of the lenvatinib in combination with AdHER2 DC vaccine, pembrolizumab, and N-803.
* Participants will undergo apheresis, and AdHER2DC vaccine will be generated by transducing the participants monocyte-derived dendritic cells with AdHER2 vector.
* Treatment will be delivered for up to 1 year or until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Up to 27 participants will be treated on this trial.",RECRUITING,,2024-05-14,2028-12-31,2026-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1|PHASE2,NON_RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,NONE,TREATMENT,60,ESTIMATED

Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of primary and malignant tumor of the brain. Currently, the standard of care for this disease includes surgical resection, followed by radiation with chemotherapy and tumor treating fields. Despite this aggressive therapy, the survival after finishing treatment remains low and the disease often reoccurs. Unfortunately, the available therapy options for recurrent glioblastoma are minimal and do not have a great effect on survival. AMSCs are found in body fat and when separated from the fat, are delivered into the surgical cavity at the time of surgery. When in direct contact with tumor cells, AMSCs affect tumor growth, residual tumor cell death, and chemotherapy resistance. The use of AMSCs delivered locally into the surgical cavity of recurrent glioblastoma during a craniotomy could improve the long-term outcomes of these patients by decreasing the progression rate and invasiveness of malignant cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of locally delivered adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of locally delivered AMSCs in patients with recurrent GBM.

II. To assess overall survival (OS) in recurrent GBM patients treated with locally delivered AMSCs.

III. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in recurrent GBM patients treated with locally delivered AMSCs.

CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore the systemic immune response after application of AMSCs through cytokine analysis on peripheral blood samples.

II. To explore the local changes on the brain parenchyma by analyzing tissue at recurrence.

III. To explore the presence of AMSCs on brain tissue at recurrence.

Although a causal relationship is implied, the mechanism remains to be proven. These neoplasms are thought to be the direct consequence of mutational events induced by the prior therapy .

Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes / acute myeloid leukemia (t- MDS / t-AML) is now considered a single entity, called therapy-related myeloid neoplasms based on the current World Health Organization WHO classification2,. It is a well-recognized clinical syndrome occurring as a late complication following Cytotoxic agents and ionizing radiotherapy in the treatment of most cancer types: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), sarcoma, and ovarian and testicular cancer3,4.

The characteristics of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and the timing of its development after a primary diagnosis depend on the exposure to specific agents as well as the cumulative dose and dose intensity of the preceding cytotoxic therapy 5.

The incidence of t-MDS/AML following conventional therapy ranges from 0.8% to 6.3% at 20 years. The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3 to 5 years, with the risk decreasing markedly after the first decade 6.

Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized in the WHO classification depending on the causative therapeutic exposure: an alkylating agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II inhibitor-related type. Alkylating agent-related t-MDS/AML usually appears 4 to 7 years after exposure to the mutagenic agent .

Approximately two-thirds of patients present with MDS and the remainder with AML with myelodysplastic features. Patients frequently present with cytopenias. Multilineage dysplasia is often present 7.

In this classic form of therapy-related leukemia that follows treatment with alkylating agents and/or radiation therapy, the blood and bone marrow findings resemble those seen in primary MDS, although the degree of dysgranulopoiesis and dysmegakaryocytopoiesis is typically greater 8.

In contrast to alkylating agent t-MDS/AML, AML secondary to topoisomerase II inhibitors often does not have a preceding myelodysplastic phase, and presents as overt acute leukemia, often with a prominent monocytic component. The latency period between the initiation of treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and the onset of leukemia is brief, with a median of 2 to 3 years 9.

The reciprocal translocation t(8;9) (p22;p24) between the short arm of chromosome 8 and the long arm of chromosome 9 is a recurrent abnormality that fuses the Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2) to the human autoantigen pericentriolar material 1 gene (PCM1) , with breakage and reunion at bands 8p11 and 9q341010.

PCM1 encodes a large protein of 228kDa containing several potential coiled-coil domains in its aminoterminal part. This protein is localized in cytoplasmatic granules referred to as centriolar satellites. It is supposed to play a crucial role in the assembly of centrosomal proteins, microtubule organisation, and in the progression of cell cycle11.

Due to PCM1-JAK2 gene fusion, the coiled-coil domains of PCM1 mediate an oligomerization that brings together the linked JAK2 domains resulting in a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase domain of JAK212, 13.

JAK2 is a member of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2). These non-receptor tyrosine kinases play a significant role in various signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein is formed of seven domains. The JH2 domain (pseudokinase domain, kinase-like domain) is located in exon 14 and has an essential negative autoregulatory function14.

The most common mechanism for JAK2 activation in hematologic malignancies is the point mutation at position 617 (V617F).

The consequences of JAK2 activation are neoplastic transformation and abnormal cell proliferation in various malignancies15.

* So, translocations involving the JAK2 locus are considered of oncogenic importance in acute leukemias and myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases.
* Patients with this abnormality present with broad clinical spectrum ranging from chronic to acute hematological diseases with myeloid or lymphoid appearance 16.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a kind of cytogenetic technique that allows the visualization of defined nucleic acid sequences in particular cellular or chromosomal sites by hybridization of complementary fluorescently labeled probe sequences within intact metaphase or interphase cells.

The fluorescent probes are nucleic acid labeled with fluorescent groups and can bind to specific DNA/RNA sequences. Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes17.",UNKNOWN,,2019-06,2022-06,2021-06,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,140,ESTIMATED

Chessels et al reported the results in 235 pediatric patients with ALL in CR3 treated between 1972 and 1998. Only 18 of the 235 patients remained alive, with multiple early treatment failures implying significant instability of the third remission state. Factors that were found to be of significant influence on survival for these patients in CR3 were length of CR2, type of second event, immunophenotype, type of third treatment, type of first relapse, presenting leukocyte count, and length of CR1. The 3-year leukemia-free survival for patients with ALL in CR3 treated with hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) was reported as 20% in a single-institution report on patients transplanted with unrelated donors between 1987 and 1999. This report found a 20% relapse rate in ALL patients in CR3 and reported that patients transplanted after 1992 had a higher rate of relapse, implying that as improved chemotherapy regimens become more successful in curing patients, those who develop relapse may have disease more resistant to treatment. Clofarabine (\[2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-arabinofuranosyl)adenine\]; Cl-F-ara-A; CAFdA) is a rationally designed, second-generation purine nucleoside antimetabolite. Clofarabine was designed as a hybrid molecule to overcome the limitations and incorporate the best qualities of fludarabine (F-ara-A) and cladribine (2-CdA, CdA), all three molecules are currently approved by the FDA for treatment of hematologic malignancies. In an open-label Phase II, pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 by IVI over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response. Among the 49 patients evaluated for efficacy, the overall remission rate was 20%. The median duration of remission could not be calculated for the 6 patients who achieved a CR because 3 patients were still in remission at the time of data cutoff. The median duration for the 4 patients who achieved a CRp was 20 weeks (Range: 4.6 to 28.6 weeks). Eight (16%) patients went on to receive a transplant with 7 (14%) experiencing clinical benefit. In an open-label Phase II study, pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed AML received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 by IVI over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response. The overall remission rate (CR + CRp) was 3%; 23% of patients achieved a PR. The median duration of remission for patients who achieved at least a PR was 16.2 weeks. Twelve (34%) patients went on to receive a transplant, 7 of whom were still alive at the time of data cutoff with survival ranging from 16.4 weeks to 93.6 weeks.

Patients enrolling must have undergone an extensive pre-transplant evaluation to assess remission status, assure adequate organ system function, and document freedom from active viral, bacterial, and fungal infection. Patients should proceed to transplant as soon as possible following their reinduction chemotherapy. Patients with delays in therapy due to toxicity or donor procurement delays should receive maintenance chemotherapy if possible. Patients must be scheduled to begin their preparative regimen within 10 days of enrolling on the study. This will be a 2 part study. Part A will be the dose escalation phase. Once the MTD and/or safe/tolerated dose of clofarabine has been established, Part B will accrue patients to further define the event free, disease free and overall survival at the MTD or safe/tolerated dose of clofarabine. At study entry during Part A, a clofarabine dose level will be assigned to each patient. During Part B, the established MTD or safe/tolerated dose of clofarabine will be used.

In Part A this study will enroll patients with ALL and ANLL in relapse, induction failure, CR3 or CR3P and without prior AlloSCT. These patients will receive a conditioning regimen of clofarabine, ARA-C and TBI followed by AlloSCT. Patients will start their pre-conditioning regimen on Day -10. Patients will receive ARA-C (3000 mg/m2 \[total ARA-C dose of 18g/m2\]) daily on Days -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, and -5 and clofarabine (Dose assigned at enrollment, see section 8.2.2 for dose escalation table for Part A) on Days -9, -8, -7, -6, and -5. On days when clofarabine and ARA-C are both given, clofarabine will be given as a 2 hr infusion followed by 4 hr rest and then ARA-C given as a 3 hr infusion. Fractionated TBI (200 cGy) will be administered twice daily for 3 days on Day -4, -3 and -2. The AlloSCT will be performed on Day 0. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of tacrolimus and MMF. In Part B, this study will enroll patients with ALL or ANLL in CR3 or CR3P and without prior AlloSCT.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes may affect the body's response to and interaction with some prescription medications.

General anesthetics such as propofol and sufentanil can inhibit the central nervous system, reduce cardiac excitability and myocardial contractility, dilate peripheral blood vessels, and have a high incidence of hypotension, especially during anesthesia induction, which is particularly common in the elderly and those with underlying underlying diseases before surgery.

However, the current research on the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on perioperative cardiac function in patients is not specific, and there is no unified anesthesia strategy for these effects during the perioperative period. Therefore, this study aims to explore: 1. the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on perioperative cardiac function in patients; 2. Improve the anesthesia plan and further explore new strategies for perioperative organ protection for such patients. The research design is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.","Traditional chemotherapy is a common treatment for cancer, usually performed after surgery, with the aim of assisting in the removal of remaining cancer cells. Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hair loss, bone marrow suppression, and other common complications can even affect the function of important organs such as the heart, lungs, and brain. In the 1980s, with the reflection on traditional chemotherapy and further understanding of tumor biology, clinical trials and research began to focus on a method of neoadjuvant chemotherapy that combines surgical resection before surgery.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to the systemic chemotherapy performed before implementing local treatment methods (such as surgery), with the aim of reducing the size of the tumor, killing invisible metastatic cells early, and reducing adverse reactions to traditional chemotherapy \[6\], which is a new chemotherapy method that is beneficial for subsequent surgery, radiotherapy, and other treatments. However, it should be noted that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may still cause a certain degree of cardiac dysfunction.

As is well known, perioperative hemodynamic fluctuations, such as decreased blood pressure and heart rate, and cardiac dysfunction, are common complications after anesthesia. General anesthetics such as propofol and sufentanil can inhibit the central nervous system, reduce cardiac excitability and myocardial contractility, dilate peripheral blood vessels, and have a high incidence of hypotension, especially during anesthesia induction, which is particularly common in the elderly and those with underlying underlying diseases before surgery.

In summary, after completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient\&#39;s physical and mental functions are affected to a certain extent. If combined with the effects of anesthetic drugs, the hemodynamic fluctuations are greater than those of the general population, which may further cause cardiac dysfunction and is worthy of attention.

Due to the lack of prospective studies, the dynamic changes of serum HCV RNA levels and the association of hepatitis are still unclear.

Some epidemiologic studies demonstrated an association between HCV infection and B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma and several reports showed higher prevalence of HCV infection among DLBCL patients than the controls. HCV infected DLBCL patients are reported to have distinct clinical characteristics, such as older, more with elevated LDH levels, and more with extra-nodal involvement. Regarding the impact of HCV infection on prognosis, the results are conflicting. Taiwan is an endemic area of HCV but there are limited reports addressing the clinical characteristics and prognosis in this unique population.

Therefore, the investigators initiate a prospective, multi-center observational study to clarify the dynamic association between serum HCV RNA levels and hepatitis in HCV-infected lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy.",,UNKNOWN,,2015-09,2019-08,2019-08,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,38,ESTIMATED

The characteristics of the disease varies significantly among patients where some have an indolent type of cancer, from which they will never experience symptoms while others have highly aggressive malignant disease that requires prompt therapeutic action.

Treatment of localized prostate cancer is based on a risk stratification, where patients are either offered therapy with curative intent - surgery or radiotherapy - or in case of low-risk disease an ""active surveillance"" strategy can be advised. In active surveillance the disease is monitored by PSA measurement, repeated biopsies and digital rectal examination. Some patients progress during active surveillance to a higher risk classification, which may lead to selection of active therapy.

TMD is frequently associated with pain and/or dysfunction such as impaired jaw function, pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), muscles and/or related structures, and associated headaches. The aetiology of TMD is multifactorial and complex.","It is known that one cause of TMD symptom development is treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC). The main treatment modalities for HNC include radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy and surgical intervention, either as a single therapy or a combination therapy. In the head and neck region, the anatomical structures are necessary for essential functions such as speech, swallowing, breathing, smell, and taste. The treatment of head and neck tumours may frequently impair some of these functions, which may result in pain, oral dysfunction, and impaired health-related quality of life.

High intensity laser therapy (HILT) is a non-invasive and painless treatment method. The latest studies have reported the beneficial effects of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser therapy in patients with pain. The advantage of HILT over low level laser therapy (LLLT) is that HILT is able to penetrate and stimulate wider and/or deeper areas; thus, considerably more energy may be transmitted to tissue during HILT therapy compared to LLLT.",COMPLETED,,2023-05-21,2025-02-10,2024-12-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,60,ACTUAL

AL increases post-operative mortality, decreases long-term survival, reduces the functional result and reduces qual-ity of life. Studies suggest that performing an indocyanine-green enhanced fluorescent angi-ography (ICGeFA), blood perfusion in the bowel can be visualised. It is suggested that using this procedure the relative risk of AL is reduced about 54-67%.

With this project we wish to evaluate the feasibility of the procedure, and, if proven feasible, to plan further studies evaluating the procedure.","Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer-diagnosis in Denmark. In 2014, 5186 pa-tients with colorectal cancer were registered. 1674 patients had cancer in the rectum and 1316 in the sigmoid colon. 668 patients underwent surgery with low anterior resection (LAR) and primary anastomosis, and 850 patients had a sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis.

A serious complication is anastomotic leakage (AL). In 2014 a total of 67 (10%) patients were registered with AL.

In general AL increases the post-operative mortality, decreases long-term survival and reduces the functional result and thereby reduces quality of life.

Due to the possible severity of AL all measures possible should be taken to ensure an early diag-nosis and timely treatment, as this has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. The symp-toms of AL are uncharacteristic; the diagnosis cannot only rely on the development of clinical symptoms. However, specific clinical scoring symptoms, measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) and radiologic examinations are proven useful.

Treatment of AL varies with the degree of leakage, from conservative treatment with rectal lavage, endo-VAC therapy, drainage of abscesses, re-laparoscopy or laparotomy with a diverting stoma, and finally to break down the anastomosis and creating a temporary or permanent colostomy, all procedures with or without antibiotic treatment.

It is essential that surgeons continuously strive to improve the operative technique with regard to anastomosis construction. Many factors influence the anastomotic healing: instrumentation error, tension on the anastomosis, bacterial contamination, etc. An important factor to ensure most opti-mal conditions in anastomotic healing is to ensure sufficient blood-supply/oxygen tension.

The surgeon evaluate so-called surrogates of bowel perfusion (evaluation of colour, mesenteric pulsation and arterial bleeding) prior to form the anastomosis, but studies have demonstrated that surgeon's intraoperative judgment in predicting of anastomotic leakage AL has an extremely low sensitivity and specificity.

Studies suggest that performing an indocyanine-green enhanced fluorescent angiography (ICGeFA), the blood perfusion in the bowel can be visualised. It is suggested that by evaluating perfusion of bowel ends, and, if needed, doing a re-resection, the risk of anastomotic leakage can be diminished. It is suggested that evaluating the anastomosis with ICG-FA and revising the anas-tomosis if necessary, the relative risk reduction of AL is about 54-67%. Several studies in robotic and laparoscopic colorectal surgery, confirms feasibility of using ICGeFA, also showing promising results in evaluating the bowel perfusion. Most studies and a newly published systematic review conclude that there is great need for larger controlled studies or randomised trails.

The primary objective with this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using ICGeFA in colorectal surgery and to evaluate if the surgeon's interpretation is dose and time dependent. Secondary ob-jective is to establish a nationwide research team, joining all the Robotic Surgery Centres in Den-mark for future research.

Last we wish to identify the optimal design for a further study, evaluating whether ICG is a helpful tool in diminishing the risk of anastomotic leakage.",COMPLETED,,2017-04-01,2018-11-30,2018-11-30,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,55,ACTUAL
